        "In the process of making the monthly interest rate decision (which in this case applies to the next two months) by the Monetary Committee, discussions are held at two levels––the first in a broad forum, and the second in a narrower one.",
        "In the broad-forum discussion, the relevant background economic conditions are presented, including real, monetary and financial developments in Israel’s economy, and developments in the global economy.",
        "Participants in this discussion include the three members of the Monetary Committee from the Bank—the Governor, the Deputy Governor and the Senior Advisor to the Governor—and the three members of the Monetary Committee from the public.",

        "An open discussion follows, which ends with a vote on the level of the interest rate.",
        "According to the Bank of Israel Law, 5770-2010, (section 18(c)), the decision on the interest rate is reached by majority vote of the members of the Monetary Committee who participate in the voting.",
        "If the vote is tied, the chairperson (the Governor) has an additional vote.",
        "T l 972 2 6552712/3 F 972 2 6528812 b ki l il Indicators which became available in the past month point toward an entrenchment of the assessment that there was an improvement in the level of activity in the economy during the first quarter of 2013.",
        "With that, it is too early to tell if this was the beginning of a positive turning point, or if it was a correction to weak results in the previous quarter.",
        "Updated indicators of economic activity in February point toward continuation of the improvement which began to be seen in January.",
        "Most indicators which became available this month are positive—the Business Tendency Survey indicates that there was improvement in activity in February, continuing that of the previous month.",
        "Similarly, the Climate Index indicates a continuation of the positive trend in the business sector, and the Composite State of the Economy Index increased in February at a rate similar to that of the previous month, and its growth rate is relatively high compared with the final quarter of 2012.",
        "The industrial production index increased by level indicating expansion in manufacturing industry.",
        "Most consumer confidence indices increased.",
        "Tax revenues in January–February were in line with the seasonal path consistent with the growth estimate of 3.8 percent.",
        "With that, it is likely that the positive picture derives from a correction from the weakness in the final quarter of a change in trend.",
        "Labor market data which became available this month indicate stability in employment for January.",
        "Labor force survey data indicate a decline of 0.3 percentage points in the unemployment rate, to 6.5 percent, in January, with a decline of 0.2 percentage points in the participation rate.",
        "There was a slight decline as well in the unemployment rate among the main employment ages of 25–64, to 5.5 percent.",
        "Unemployment data are consistent with figures of the Israeli Employment Service, which reported a decline in the number of unemployed and laid off workers in January.",
        "Employers' expectations in various industries reported in the Business Tendency Survey for February present a mixed picture for the changes in the number of employed people in the coming 3 months.",
        "This was in line with the decline of 7 percent in February in the number of available posts.",
        "Nominal wages increased by 1.3 percent and real wages increased by 0.9 percent in the fourth quarter, based on seasonally adjusted data.",
        "Health tax receipts by the National Insurance Institute, which provide an indication of nominal wage payments, were 5.4 percent higher in December–February than in the corresponding period of the previous year, reflecting a slowdown compared with an average year over year increase of 6.4 percent in the preceding 3 month period.",
        "In February, the government operated without an approved budget framework and in accordance with the law allowing it to spend 1/12 of the overall 2012 budget each month in 2013 (including debt repayments), until a budget framework is approved.",
        "The cumulative deficit from the beginning of the year is about NIS 1.3 billion, about NIS 4.1 billion greater than the seasonal path consistent with the deficit of 3.6 percent of GDP derived from the fiscal rule and tax rates set in law.",
        "An examination of the spending commitments for 2013 made in past years indicates that in order to abide by the expenditure rule, the government must reduce the commitments by about NIS 13 billion (about 1.3 percent of GDP).",
        "Even after such cuts, this is still a real expansion of about 4.5 percent compared with the 2012 budget.",
        "Deviation in the government deficit is liable to lead to increased interest rates in the economy.",
        "The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for February remained unchanged, in line with forecasts.",
        "The rate of increase in the CPI over the past 12 months remained essentially unchanged compared to recent months, at 1.5 percent.",
        "Forecasters' inflation projections for the next twelve months, as well as inflation expectations based on over-the-counter CPI futures contracts offered by banks, were next twelve months calculated from the capital markets (breakeven inflation), seasonally adjusted, remained stable at 2 percent.",
        "Inflation expectations for short terms (2–3 years) were unchanged at 2.4 percent, while expectations for the medium term declined slightly from the previous two months.",
        "Expectations for longer terms declined from 2.4 percent to 2.3 percent, continuing the marked decline of last month year from now derived from the Telbor (Tel Aviv Inter-Bank Offered Rate) market, and expectations based on the average projection of forecasters, are for an interest rate of 1.6 percent and 1.75 percent, respectively.",
        "In the twelve months ending in February, the M1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 12.9 percent, and the M2 aggregate (M1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 6.9 percent.",

        "Interest rates on new mortgages taken out in January remained unchanged.",
        "The decline in the LTV ratio for housing loans continued in February, against the background of directives issued by the Supervisor of Banks.",
        "There was also a decline in the proportion of mortgages granted to finance homes purchased for investment purposes.",
        "The decline in the average LTV ratio and in the proportion of mortgages for investment purposes apparently indicate the increasing influence of constraints imposed by the Banking Supervision Department.",
        "The housing component of the CPI (based on housing rents) declined by 0.4 percent in February.",
        "In the twelve months ending in February, it increased by 2.5 percent, compared with an increase of 2.9 percent in the twelve months to January.",

        "The rate of increase in home prices continues to rise.",
        "In the twelve months ending in January, home prices increased by 8.6 percent, compared with an increase of 6.7 percent in the twelve months to December.",
        "There were 39,794 building starts in the 12 months ending in December, and this is expected to continue to support a high level of stock of homes.",
        "With that, the number of building starts in 2012 was about 13 percent lower than in 2011.",
        "In addition, the rate of properties marketed by the Israel Lands Administration has declined sharply.",
        "This month, the Bank of Israel Research Department updated its macroeconomic forecast.",
        "According to its projection, the inflation rate over the next 4 quarters will be was formulated, is expected to remain at that level in the coming year, and GDP, following the beginning of natural gas production from the Tamar field, is expected to grow by 3.8 percent in 2013 (similar to the previous forecast).",
        "Excluding the effect of natural gas production from Tamar, growth is projected to be 2.8 percent.",
        "In 2014, growth, impacted by the expected recovery worldwide, is forecast to accelerate to 4.0 percent (3.3 percent excluding the effect of natural gas production from Tamar).",
        "Gas production requires a small number of workers, so that the developments expected in employment and unemployment will primarily be affected by growth of GDP excluding gas production.",
        "From February 24, 2013, through March 20, 2013, the shekel appreciated by about nominal effective exchange rate, the shekel appreciated by about 1.95 percent during the period.",
        "The shekel's strength against the dollar during the month was in contrast to the dollar's trend worldwide.",

        "Spreads in the corporate bond market widened for companies with lower ratings.",
        "The global macroeconomic picture was mixed in the past month.",
        "In the US, macro data continued to be mostly positive, and indicated continued recovery in the economy, despite the fiscal tightening measures which went into effect in the beginning of the year and in March.",
        "With that, the consequences of those measures, together with the debt ceiling issue, present a risk to the continued process of improvement, as already expressed in the decline in the consumer confidence index there.",
        "In the eurozone, macro data continued to be weak and indicated continued recession.",
        "Against this background, the European Commission and the ECB recently revised their eurozone growth forecasts for 2013 downward, with neither entity forecasting positive growth until 2014.",
        "In China, recent macro data indicated some loss of momentum in the growth rate.",
        "In the eurozone, there were two factors in the recent month which increased concern of a return of the debt crisis in Europe— election results in Italy which raised doubts about continued implementation of reforms in the country, and developments in Cyprus.",
        "Over the period, stock market indices of advanced economies increased.",
        "Oil and metals prices declined during the period, and agricultural commodity prices were stable.",
        "Monetary policy at most central banks did not change during the past month, and interest rates in major economies remained low, with expectations for accommodative monetary policy to continue.",
        "The six members of the Monetary Committee participating in the discussion decide on the appropriate rate of interest for the economy.",
        "After the discussion on the interest rate for April–May 2013, the Committee members voted unanimously to keep the interest rate unchanged at 1.75 percent.",
        "The discussion focused on the following main issues: (1) the inflation environment; market, and (5) the housing market.",
        "The Committee discussed the inflation environment—actual inflation and expectations for the coming year are around the midpoint of the target range.",
        "There was agreement among Committee members that the current inflation environment does not pose a limitation on reducing the interest rate should that be necessary.",
        "Committee members agreed that an analysis of macroeconomic data and the results of surveys indicate an improvement in economic activity in the first quarter of 2013.",
        "With that, it is still too early to tell if results of the current quarter are a positive turning point in the level of economic activity which is expected to continue to expand, or if it is a temporary correction following weak growth in the previous quarter due to one-time circumstances, including, among other things, operation Pillar of Defense.",
        "As support for the viewpoint that we are at a turning point, it was noted that the effect of security occurrences on the economy's activity was relatively constrained, and thus it is difficult to attribute the entire improvement in economic activity to a correction following operation Pillar of Defense.",
        "Furthermore, indicators of private consumption and survey results signal optimism about expected developments.",
        "Yet in contrast, there were no major changes in the global economy in recent months, particularly in world trade, which would support a change in trend, thus it is possible that the increase in exports is a correction and not a turning point.",
        "Committee members discussed developments in fiscal policy as well.",
        "Members expressed their concern about a negative impact on fiscal credibility as a result of not meeting deficit targets in the coming two years.",
        "The negative impact is liable to be expressed in an increase in funding costs of the government debt in the future.",
        "This concern derives from, among other things, the fact that the deficit in 2012 was, for the most part, structural, in a year in which the level of economic activity, as evidenced by the low unemployment rate, was not far from its potential level.",
        "Overcommitments in 2013, relative to the government's expenditure rule, total around NIS government will have to significantly reduce its expenditures, and at the same time, increase its revenues.",
        "Committee members noted that even if such a cut is implemented, fiscal policy will not be restraining, since it reflects a real increase of The discussion also covered the foreign exchange market and the appreciation of the shekel in recent months.",
        "The Committee noted that the recent months' appreciation brought the exchange rate to a level slightly more appreciated than the level it was in the summer, before the depreciation it experienced in light of the security-related tensions.",
        "Committee members agree that the rate of increase of home prices in recent months continues to be high, and that signs of moderation of activity in the market for homes are not seen, based on updated figures.",
        "With that, it was noted that home prices have not yet been fully affected by the most recent measure of the Supervisor of Banks which requires banks to increase their capital buffers in respect of mortgages.",
        "Committee members emphasized that monetary policy is limited in its ability, on its own, to affect this market, through its effect on demand for homes.",
        "Thus, the new government will need to adopt measures to expand the supply (accelerating planning processes and increased marketing of land, primarily in areas in demand), as well as possibly to restrain demand (such as taxation measures).",
        "Following the discussion, the six members of the Monetary Committee voted on the Bank of Israel interest rate for April–May 2013.",
        "All Committee members supported keeping the interest rate unchanged at 1.75 percent.",
        "The decision to keep the interest rate for April–May 2013 unchanged at 1.75 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel's interest rate policy, which is intended to entrench the inflation rate within the price stability target of 1–3 percent a year over the next twelve months, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability.",
        "The path of the interest rate in the future depends on developments in the inflation environment, growth in Israel and in the global economy, the monetary policies of major central banks, and developments in the exchange rate of the shekel.",
        "In its announcement, the Bank highlighted the following main considerations underlying the decision to keep the interest rate unchanged at 1.75 percent: - The inflation environment reflected in increased actual prices and expectations for one year ahead remains stable.",
        "Inflation over the previous 12 months was 1.5 percent, and forecasters' inflation projections for the next year are 1.8 percent, on average.",
        "- Updated indicators of economic activity in February point toward continuation of the signs of improvement which began to be seen in January, but it is still too early to determine if this is a positive turning point.",
        "According to the Research Department's staff forecast, GDP growth is expected to be 3.8 percent in 2013, and 4 percent in 2014.",
        "Excluding the effects of natural gas production from percent in 2014.",
        "- One of the sources of uncertainty regarding developments in the economy is the government's fiscal policy.",
        "An examination of the budget commitments which are already in place indicates that in order to abide by the expenditure rule, the government must reduce commitments this year by about NIS 13 billion (about expansion of about 4.5 percent compared with the 2012 budget.",
        "Deviation in the government deficit is liable to lead to increased interest rates in the economy.",
        "- The global macroeconomic picture is mixed.",
        "There are signs of recovery in the US economy, while in Europe, the slowdown continues.",
        "With that, it appears that the there has been a decline in the probability of a crisis occurring, a development which has reduced the high level of uncertainty that prevailed in the past year.",
        "- In terms of the effective exchange rate, the shekel continued its appreciation this month, following its strengthening in recent months.",
        "- The rate of increase in home prices continues to rise, and in the 12 months which ended in January, home prices increased by 8.6 percent, compared with an increase of 6.7 percent in the 12 months which ended in December.",
        "- During the past month, the expansionary policies of major central banks continued, and interest rates in those economies remained near zero.",
        "The accommodative policies of central banks in major advanced economies, based on their announcements, are expected to continue during the rest of the year.",
        "The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli and global economies and in financial markets, particularly in light of the continuing high level of uncertainty in the global economy.",
        "The Bank will use the tools available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, and in this regard will keep a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housing market.",
        "In the process of making the monthly interest rate decision by the Monetary Committee, discussions are held at two levels––the first in a broad forum, and the second in a narrower one.",
        "In the broad-forum discussion, the relevant background economic conditions are presented, including real, monetary and financial developments in Israel’s economy, and developments in the global economy.",
        "Participants in this discussion include the three members of the Monetary Committee from the Bank—the Governor, the Deputy Governor and the Senior Advisor to the Governor—and the three members of the Monetary Committee from the public.",
        "Other participants in the discussion are the Directors of the Research and Market Operations Departments, and economists from various departments who prepare and present the material for discussion.",
        "The data, estimates and assessments in this report are those that were available at the time of the discussions.",
        "In the narrow forum, which consists of the Monetary Committee and the Directors of the Research and Market Operations Departments, the two Departmental Directors present their recommendations regarding the interest rate.",
        "An open discussion follows, which ends with a vote on the level of the interest rate.",
        "According to the Bank of Israel Law, 5770-2010, (section 18(c)), the decision on the interest rate is reached by majority vote of the members of the Monetary Committee who participate in the voting.",
        "If the vote is tied, the chairperson (the Governor) has an additional vote.",
        "The development of actual prices and inflation expectations for the coming year, indicate an inflation environment somewhat below the midpoint of the target range, and are apparently affected by moderation in domestic demand.",
        "Indicators of real economic activity continue to point toward stability in activity, and even to some improvement in expectations for growth in the coming year.",
        "Various indicators point toward stability in real economic activity, and signal a slight improvement in expectations for growth over the coming 12 months.",
        "The Composite State-of-the-Economy Index increased by 0.1 percent in December, similar to its rate of recent months, and in contrast to the monthly rate of 0.2 percent in the first half of December indicates slight improvement in the growth rate, at a low level of activity, and was affected by a sharp increase in the expectations component and by an improvement in the assessment of present activity, in contrast to declines registered in the assessment of past activity.",
        "The improvement is prominent in the manufacturing indices, and can be seen as well in the retail trade and services industries.",
        "The Purchasing Managers Index also increased, though it is still below the 50 point mark, thus indicating contraction.",
        "Labor force survey data for the third quarter indicate a continued increase in the participation rate, the number of employed persons, and, accordingly, in the employment rate as well, which increased to 74.5 percent, from 73.3 percent in the second quarter (among 25–64 year olds, the age range which was less affected by changes in the labor force survey's methodology in the beginning of 2012).",
        "Monthly labor force data, updated to November, indicate stability in the participation rate and in the employment rate, as well as a slight decline in the unemployment rate, to 5.7 percent from 5.9 percent in October.",
        "(The decline was in the 25–64 year old age range; in the general population the unemployment rate declined from 6.9 percent to employed in full-time positions, and an increase in the number of people temporarily absent from work, but this was attributed mainly to the security situation that month.",
        "Stability in total employment, seen as well in employee posts data, reflects a continued trend of decline in the number of employee posts in the private sector and increase in public sector posts.",
        "The climate index for employment, calculated from the Business Tendency Survey, also indicates stability.",
        "Compared with September, nominal wages increased in October by 1.2 percent, and real wages increased by 0.5 percent, based on seasonally adjusted data.",
        "Health tax receipts, which provide an indication of nominal wage payments, were 5.7 percent higher in November– December than in the corresponding period of the previous year, compared with a year over year increase of 5.8 percent in October–November (a figure which was revised upward).",
        "Foreign trade data for December continued to show a declining trend of imports and exports, similar to the picture provided by National Accounts data.",
        "Goods exports declined by more than 3 percent in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter, with a decline of 4 percent in high technology industries, a decline of 10 percent in medium-low technology industries, and stability or slight improvement in other industries.",
        "It appears that in the recent period a gap has opened between the index of US trade in advanced technology products and the index, which is in a trend of decline, of electronics exports from Israel.",
        "In 2012, the overall government deficit, excluding net credit, totaled about NIS 39 billion, which is 4.2 percent of GDP, compared with a deficit of 3.4 percent of GDP which was forecast in the beginning of 2012.",
        "Tax receipts in 2012 totaled NIS 218.6 billion.",
        "This was about NIS 3 billion lower than forecast at the beginning of 2012.",
        "The accumulated deviation from the original deficit projection derives from revenues about NIS 6.9 billion below, and expenditure about NIS 2.2 billion above, the original budget, due to the transfer of unutilized balances from previous years.",
        "Until a new government is formed, and the budget is approved, there will be uncertainty regarding how the government will deal with the need to align the budget with the limitations of the deficit target and expenditures.",
        "The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for December increased by 0.2 percent.",
        "This was above forecasts, which projected, on average, no change in the CPI.",
        "With that, the CPI for December was in line with the seasonal path for the month consistent with attaining the inflation target.",
        "Inflation for the full year of 2012 was 1.6 percent, within the target range.",
        "The main contributions to inflation in 2012 derived from prices of housing, which increased by 3.3 percent, and of energy, which increased by 6.5 percent.",
        "Excluding housing and energy, the inflation rate in 2012 was 0.6 percent.",
        "The development of inflation over the course of the year reflects the slowdown in domestic demand together with one-time effects in the prices of kindergarten services and cellular communications.",

        "Expectations for the Bank of Israel interest rate one year from now derived from the Telbor (Tel Aviv Inter-Bank Offered Rate) market, as well as expectations based on the average projection of forecasters, are for an interest rate of 1.6 percent and 1.7 percent, respectively.",
        "The forecasters who provide projections to the Bank of Israel predict that the interest rate for February will remain unchanged.",
        "Yields on short-term government bonds declined moderately, in contrast to an increase of about 5 basis points in medium to long terms.",
        "Yields on CPI-indexed bonds increased by about 5–10 basis points for most maturities.",
        "Yields on government bonds worldwide increased more sharply, by about 20 basis points.",

        "From the previous monetary policy discussion held on December 23, 2012, through January 25, 2013, the shekel strengthened against the dollar by about 0.9 percent, a more moderate rate than the appreciation of most major currencies against the dollar.",
        "Nonresidents' activity was mixed, with foreign exchange sales in the beginning of the period and purchases later on.",
        "This was against the background of events around the world in the beginning of the period, primarily the concerns regarding the fiscal cliff in the US.",
        "The shekel appreciated by 0.8 percent against the euro, while most major currencies weakened against the euro.",
        "In terms of the nominal effective exchange rate the shekel appreciated by about 0.6 percent during the period.",
        "From the previous monetary policy discussion held on December 23, 2012, through January 25, 2013, the Tel Aviv 25 Index declined by about 0.6 percent.",
        "Spreads in the corporate bond market continued to contract for all ratings, though primarily for lower ones.",
        "For the first time in a while, investment houses assess that the risks in the global economy have decreased.",
        "Thus, the risk of a deterioration in the debt crisis in Europe declined, and the uncertainty regarding the fiscal cliff issue mostly receded.",
        "Yields on government bonds of Spain and Italy, as well as CDS spreads, continued to decline to a level that had not been seen in over 2 years, and in Spain, bank deposits in recent months have once again increased, indicating confidence in the banking system.",
        "With that, the overall debt crisis is far from over—fiscal adjustments in various European countries are expected to continue in the coming year as well, and it is assessed that crises are expected with regard to countries meeting their targets.",
        "Macro data which were published this month in the US and emerging markets continued to be positive.",
        "In contrast, data published in Europe indicate that the recession there is continuing.",
        "This was seen this month in a figure published in Germany, showing that its economy contracted by 0.5 percent in the fourth quarter.",
        "Over the past month, most countries did not register a change in monetary policy, and interest rates in major economies remained low.",
        "In addition, markets are not pricing in an interest rate increase by the central bank of any major economy this year.",
        "Japan's government announced an additional fiscal incentive plan as well as an increase in the inflation target to 2 percent from 1 percent, and the central bank announced a new open-ended asset purchase plan.",
        "This month, commodity prices were stable, while oil prices increased by 3.8 percent, against the background of events in Algeria.",
        "According to World Bank assessments, commodity prices are expected to decline over the next two years, except for the prices of industrial metals which are expected to remain stable.",
        "The six members of the Monetary Committee participating in the discussion decide on the appropriate rate of interest for the economy.",
        "After the discussion on the interest rate for February 2013, all of the Committee members voted to keep the interest rate unchanged at 1.75 percent.",
        "The discussion focused on the following main issues: (1) developments in the domestic and global economies; (2) developments in the exchange rate; (3) developments in the housing market and the construction industry, and (4) the fiscal situation.",
        "Committee members noted the stability in the GDP growth rate at around 3 percent, in unemployment, and in inflation in Israel's economy.",
        "They also noted that the level of pessimism in monthly surveys of economic activity declined, and no longer indicates a continued slowdown in activity.",
        "Committee members assessed that in the global economy, it appears that the risks of a deterioration in the debt crisis in Europe are declining, and concerns over the \"fiscal cliff\" in the US have mostly receded.",
        "In their assessment, the level of activity in Europe does not indicate a recovery, but macro figures published in the US and in China were mostly positive.",
        "Committee members discussed developments in the exchange rate.",
        "It was noted that the shekel strengthened slightly against the dollar since the last monetary policy discussion, continuing the appreciation of 2 percent in the full year of 2012.",
        "Committee members assessed that continued quantitative easing in the US, Europe, and Japan supports the strengthening of the shekel.",
        "The assessment was also made that the beginning of the use of offshore natural gas reservoirs, expected in 2013, will contribute to an increase in the current account surplus, and thus will also be a factor supporting the appreciation of the shekel in the coming year.",
        "The extent of the impact on the exchange rate in the future depends on the degree to which this information is already reflected in the exchange rate.",
        "In the housing sector, Committee members expressed concern in light of the renewed increase in home prices at a rapid pace, in parallel to a decline in building starts and an increase in the number of transactions and in mortgage volume.",
        "Members noted that the effect of policy measures taken in the final quarter of 2012 limiting the LTV ratio should be reflected in new mortgage volume beginning with January 2013 data.",
        "In the discussion, it was emphasized that the policy steps taken by the Bank of Israel in recent years in the area of mortgages are aimed primarily at maintaining financial stability and that their moderating effect on the housing market operates only on the demand side.",
        "Committee members are of the opinion that important factors in the increase in home prices at this time are a slowing of planning processes and the decline in the rate of marketing properties.",
        "Thus, dealing with home prices needs to focus on expediting the planning processes and increasing the marketing of land, primarily in high demand areas, which will lead to an increased supply of homes for residence.",
        "The government has tools to increase the supply of homes for residence which can act to moderate the increase in home prices without negatively impacting on the level of activity in the industry.",
        "A central issue in the Committee's discussion was fiscal policy.",
        "Committee members expressed their concern of a negative impact on the credibility of fiscal policy in light of the large government deficit in 2012.",
        "The concern stems from the fact that in the Committee's assessment, supported by, among other things the economy's relatively low unemployment rate, most of the deficit is structural, not cyclical.",
        "Committee members are of the opinion that dealing with the structural deficit in Israel, which is also high relative to other advanced economies in the world, requires a significant cut in expenditure, relative to the government's commitments for 2013 and 2014, along with increasing taxes.",
        "In this regard, it was emphasized that even though Israel's debt to GDP ratio remains stable and is not high relative to many advanced economies, Israel's debt burden is high, even relative to those economies, because of the high interest rate that Israel pays on its debt, compared with the other countries.",
        "Following the discussion, the six members of the Monetary Committee voted on the Bank of Israel interest rate for February 2013.",
        "All Committee members supported keeping the interest rate unchanged at 1.75 percent.",
        "This decision is consistent with the Bank of Israel's interest rate policy, which is intended to entrench the inflation rate within the price stability target of 1–3 percent a year over the next twelve months, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability.",
        "The path of the interest rate in the future depends on developments in the inflation environment, growth in Israel and in the global economy, the monetary policies of major central banks, and developments in the exchange rate of the shekel.",
        "In its announcement, the Bank highlighted the following main considerations underlying the decision to keep the interest rate unchanged at 1.75 percent: - The development of actual prices and of inflation expectations for the year ahead continue to indicate an inflation environment below the midpoint of the target range.",
        "Inflation over the previous 12 months was 1.6 percent, and inflation expectations for the year ahead, based on various sources, are slightly below the midpoint of the target range.",
        "The development of inflation during 2012 reflects the slowdown in domestic demand.",
        "According to World Bank assessments, commodity prices are expected to decline over the coming 2 years, and thus support a continued low inflation environment in Israel.",
        "- Various indicators of real economic activity support the assessment that in the past half year there has been a slowdown in the rate of demand growth, with stability in the GDP growth rate and a decline in imports.",
        "The Research Department assessment is that the GDP growth remained around 3 percent.",
        "Monthly indicators do not point toward further deterioration in activity, and indicate a slight improvement in expectations of economic activity.",
        "- The rate of increase in home prices continues to rise, and in the 12 months ending in November, home prices increased by 5.7 percent, compared with 3.7 percent in the 12 months to October.",
        "The impact on home prices of the LTV ratio limitations, which were imposed by the Supervisor of Banks and went into effect at the beginning of November, was not reflected in December mortgage data, but is expected to be seen beginning in January.",
        "- For the first time in some time, investment houses assess that the risks in the global economy have decreased.",
        "Thus, the risk of a deterioration in the debt crisis in Europe declined, and the uncertainty regarding the fiscal cliff issue in the US mostly receded.",
        "Macro data published this month in the US and China continued to be positive.",
        "In contrast, data published in Europe indicate that activity has still not reached a turning point and the recession there continues.",
        "- Over the past month, most major central banks did not change their monetary policy, and interest rates in major economies remained low.",
        "The quantitative easing programs in the US and UK continue, and the Bank of Japan announced additional monetary easing plans.",
        "Market assessments are that the accommodative policies of central banks in major advanced economies are expected to continue.",
        "The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli and global economies and in financial markets, particularly in light of the continuing high level of uncertainty in the global economy.",
        "The Bank will use the tools available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, and in this regard will keep a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housing market.",
        "In the process of making the monthly interest rate decision by the Monetary Committee, discussions are held at two levels––the first in a broad forum, and the second in a narrower one.",
        "In the broad-forum discussion, the relevant background economic conditions are presented, including real, monetary and financial developments in Israel’s economy, and developments in the global economy.",
        "Participants in this discussion include the three members of the Monetary Committee from the Bank—the Governor, the Deputy Governor and the Senior Advisor to the Governor—and the three members of the Monetary Committee from the public.",
        "Other participants in the discussion are the Directors of the Research and Market Operations Departments, and economists from various departments who prepare and present the material for discussion.",
        "The data, estimates and assessments in this report are those that were available at the time of the discussions.",
        "In the narrow forum, which consists of the Monetary Committee and the Directors of the Research and Market Operations Departments, the two Departmental Directors present their recommendations regarding the interest rate.",
        "An open discussion follows, which ends with a vote on the level of the interest rate.",
        "According to the Bank of Israel Law, 5770-2010, (section 18(c)), the decision on the interest rate is reached by majority vote of the members of the Monetary Committee who participate in the voting.",
        "If the vote is tied, the chairperson (the Governor) has an additional vote.",
        "T l 972 2 6552712/3 F 972 2 6528812 b ki l il The most recent monthly indicators of the level of activity in the economy are mixed: a continued slowdown in exports was offset by continued moderate growth in demand and an improvement in expectations of business sector activity.",
        "National accounts data indicate that the growth rate in the fourth quarter of 2012 was 2.5 percent—lower than in previous quarters, apparently due to the effects of Operation Pillar of Defense.",
        "This decline reflects a decrease in goods exports and imports, as well as a slowdown in growth of the main uses—private consumption and investments (principal industries and housing)—contrasted by an increase in public consumption.",
        "The most recent monthly indicators show that economic activity continues to grow moderately, although there are some indications that there may have been an improvement in the rate of this growth in January.",
        "The Composite State-of-theEconomy Index in its new format increased by 0.2 percent in January.",
        "Foreign trade data, the Business Tendency Survey, and consumer confidence indices in recent months have shown a decline in export sales in general, and in the high technology sector in particular.",
        "In contrast, sales in the domestic market have improved during the most recent period.",
        "Import data were mixed, with a continued decline in the import of investment goods contrasted by sharp growth in the import of raw materials and consumer goods (durables and non-durables).",
        "Most of the recent labor market data indicate stability.",
        "Labor force survey data indicate a slight increase in unemployment during the fourth quarter of 2012, to 6.9 percent, accompanied by a decline in the participation rate of 0.4 percentage points.",
        "At the same time, the unemployment rate among the main employment ages of 25-64 declined slightly during the fourth quarter of 2012, accompanied by a decline in the participation rate and a more moderate decline in the employment rate.",
        "Examining the number of employed persons by industry shows that, compared to the previous quarter, there was an increase in employment in the business sector, particularly in the trade and construction industries, and a decline in the number of employed persons in the public services as a whole (other than education).",
        "An analysis of salaried positions in the government and private (financial and non-financial) sectors indicates that growth in the number of positions in October and November comprised not just the government sector (as in previous quarters), but also the private sector, following declines in private sector employment in previous quarters.",
        "The balance of filled positions minus vacant positions, which appears in the survey of employers, also indicates stability in the labor market.",
        "Compared to the third quarter, nominal wages increased in October-November by 0.5 percent, while real wages increased by 0.2 percent, based on seasonally adjusted data.",
        "Health tax receipts, which provide an indication of nominal wage payments, were 4.7 percent higher in December-January than in the corresponding period of the previous year, compared with a year over year increase of 5.7 percent in October-November.",
        "There was a budget surplus of NIS 2.4 billion in domestic government activity in January.",
        "This is characteristic of January, but is lower than in previous years and than the seasonal path consistent with attaining the government's deficit target of 3 percent of GDP.",
        "Total domestic expenditure (excluding credit) in January was about NIS 19 billion—about NIS 2 billion above the level of expenditure that corresponds to the seasonal path for government expenditure in accordance with the expenditure ceiling.",
        "In January, the government operated without an approved budget framework and in accordance with the law allowing it to spend 1/12 of last year's overall budget each month (including debt repayments), adjusted for increases in the CPI.",
        "Until a new government is formed, and the budget is approved, there will be uncertainty regarding the government's 2013 budget.",
        "The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for January declined by 0.2 percent.",
        "This was below forecasts, which projected, on average, no change in the CPI.",
        "The rate of increase in the CPI over the past 12 months remains essentially unchanged compared to previous months, at 1.5 percent.",
        "Forecasters' inflation projections for the next twelve months remained stable this month, at 1.9 percent, as did inflation expectations based on over-the-counter CPI futures contracts offered by banks, at 1.8 percent.",

        "Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by the five-year CDS spread declined slightly during the intermeeting period to 145 basis points, accompanied by an increase in volatility during Operation \"Pillar of Defense\".",
        "In the twelve months ending in January, the M1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 10.4 percent, and the M2 aggregate (M1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 6 percent.",
        "The outstanding debt of the business sector declined by 1.1 percent in December, from NIS 791 billion to NIS 782 billion, although more than half of the decrease apparently derived from the appreciation of the shekel.",
        "In the past 12 months the debt of the business sector remained unchanged.",

        "The balance of housing debt was NIS 269 billion at the end of December, an increase of 6.9 percent compared with December 2011.",
        "Against the background of continued growth in this balance and the absence of appropriate growth in allowances for doubtful debts in respect of housing credit, the Supervisor of Banks published a draft directive increasing the required risk weighting and provisioning on housing loans, and reducing the required capital allocation for guarantees in respect of homes already delivered to residents.",
        "Interest rates on new mortgages granted in January declined across all linkage tracks, mainly in the unindexed, floating-rate track, against the background of the reduction in the Bank of Israel interest rate for January.",

        "Spreads in the corporate bond market continued to contract for all ratings, though primarily for lower ones.",
        "The improving trend in the global economy continued, and the widespread assessment is that there has been a decline in the probability of occurrence of the risks which generated a very high level of uncertainty last year—the fiscal cliff in the US, a deterioration in the debt crisis in Europe, and a moderation of growth in China.",
        "In the US, macro data have been mixed, while there is concern that the US budget contraction expected in March is liable to impact growth negatively.",
        "The recession in the eurozone continues—in the final quarter of 2012, all 4 of the major economies in the eurozone, as well as the overall eurozone economy itself, contracted at a sharper than expected rate.",
        "Some indicators, primarily sentiment measures, point toward the possibility of an improvement in the trend beginning in 2013.",

        "It seems that the risks of a deterioration in the crisis abroad have declined recently.",
        "The Committee also assessed that the budget deficit in 2012 was primarily structural, and that the government would therefore need to make significant cuts in expenditure and to raise taxes in order to meet budget targets for 2013 and the credibility of budgetary policy, especially since the economy is operating close to full employment.",
        "The Committee discussed the moderating inflation environment and expectations for inflation for the coming year, which are slightly below the midpoint of the inflation target range.",
        "There was widespread agreement that the current level of inflation does not limit on lowering the interest rate if that becomes necessary.",
        "The discussion dealt at length with the foreign exchange market and the appreciation of the shekel in recent months.",
        "It was argued that the positive interest rate gap with large economies abroad and the continued quantitative easing in those economies continue to support the inflow of capital to the Israeli economy.",

        "The Committee does not identify signs of moderation in housing market activity in the recent data, although that data has still not reflected the effects of the most recent step taken by the Supervisor of Banks requiring banks to increase their capital buffers against the risks inherent in mortgages.",
        "Home prices have continued to increase at a rapid rate in recent months.",
        "Committee members emphasized that monetary policy acts primarily on the demand side, while the required steps are supply-side steps that have the ability to lead to an increase in the inventory of homes while reducing prices, and such steps are not expected before the new government is constituted and the budget is passed.",
        "The Committee members who supported keeping the interest rate unchanged noted that indicators of expected real activity, particularly the improvement in expectations of activity compared to previous months, alongside the turnaround in imports, may point toward an end to the slowdown.",
        "In addition, reducing the interest rate may act to spur housing prices, while further steps on the supply side are not expected to have an effect in the coming months.",
        "The Committee member who supported reducing the interest rate argued that we must bolster support for the moderating level of activity as reflected in data from the last quarter, particularly export data, and that lowering the interest rate is expected to reduce the pressure for appreciation of the shekel and to support exports.",
        "In addition, actual and projected levels of inflation do not pose a limit on reducing the interest rate.",
        "Following the discussion, the six members of the Monetary Committee voted on the Bank of Israel interest rate for March 2013.",
        "Five of the Committee members supported keeping the interest rate unchanged at 1.75 percent, while one Committee member voted to reduce the interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point.",
        "In its announcement, the Bank highlighted the following main considerations underlying the decision to keep the interest rate unchanged at 1.75 percent: - Various indicators of real economic activity are mixed.",
        "Surveys indicate an improvement in expectations of economic activity in the business sector, and the most recent monthly indicators show a possibility that there was some improvement in January in the rate of activity.",
        "In contrast, GDP grew by 2.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2012, a lower rate than in previous quarters.",
        "This was apparently affected by, among other things, Operation Pillar of Defense.",
        "It is therefore early to assess whether this represents a turnaround in economic activity.",
        "- The development of actual prices and of inflation expectations for the year ahead continues to indicate an inflation environment below the midpoint of the target range.",
        "Inflation over the previous 12 months was 1.5 percent, and estimates of inflation expectations for the year ahead, based on various sources, are slightly below the midpoint of the target range.",
        "- The widespread assessment is that the risk of a deterioration in the global economic crisis has declined.",
        "At the same time, macro-economic data from leading economies are mixed.",
        "Therefore, at this stage, it is too early to determine whether this represents a positive turnaround.",
        "- The nominal effective exchange rate of the shekel appreciated in recent months after a decline last summer.",
        "- The rate of increase in home prices continues to rise, and in the 12 months ending in December, home prices increased by 6.7 percent, compared with 5.8 percent in the 12 months to November.",
        "The growth in the volume of new mortgages taken also continued in recent months.",
        "Last week, the Supervisor of Banks published a Draft Directive requiring banks to increase their capital buffers and allowances against the risks inherent in the housing loans portfolio.",

        "The Committee agreed that its unscheduled decision to reduce the interest rate and put in place a foreign currency purchasing program contributed to halting the appreciation trend of the shekel and even to its depreciation, effects which were also supported by the strengthening of the dollar on world markets.",
        "Most of the Committee members believed that in light of the basic pressures that exist for appreciation (such as natural gas production, the widening of interest rate gaps and the state of the economy), it is desirable to lower the interest rate in order to continue offsetting these forces.",
        "In this regard, the Committee discussed market expectations and the data inherent in financial markets.",

        "The GDP growth rate during the first quarter of 2013 is similar to the 2012 average, and it is possible that the actual rate is higher than reported, since the decline that was registered in domestic defense consumption may lead to an upward revision in the data in the next update, or be reflected in an increase later in the year.",

        "The Committee members agree that home prices have continued to increase at a high rate in the past few months, and that no signs of moderation in housing market activity can be identified based on up-to-date data.",
        "While the increase in home prices in February (the last available data) was lower than in previous months (0.5 percent compared to more than 1 percent in the four preceding months), the Committee estimates that since the monthly data are volatile, it cannot be concluded that there is moderation based on this.",
        "The tax measures discussed by the government were mentioned (such as the cancellation of the betterment tax exemption for investors, and imposing taxes on those upgrading their housing), and the Committee’s assessment was that when these measures are implemented, a moderation of demand in the housing market can be expected.",
        "With that, Committee members emphasized that measures are needed on the supply side which can lead to an increased rate of building of apartments and thus to moderation of their prices.",
        "The main argument of the Committee member who supported leaving the interest rate unchanged is that the current interest rate level is consistent with the current conditions of economic growth and inflation, in a way that balances the effect of a change in the interest rate on the forces acting for the shekel’s appreciation in the foreign exchange market and its ramifications on the forces acting to raise prices in the housing market.",
        "Following the discussion, the six members of the Monetary Committee voted on the Bank of Israel interest rate for June 2013.",
        "Five of the Committee members supported lowering the interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point, while one Committee member voted to leave the interest rate unchanged.",
        "In its announcement, the Bank highlighted the following main considerations underlying the decision to lower the interest rate for June by 0.25 percentage points to - Following on the measures announced by the Monetary Committee two weeks ago, the Committee decided to reduce the interest rate and thus narrow the gaps between the Bank of Israel’s interest rate and the rates in major economies worldwide, in order to weaken the forces for appreciation of the shekel.",
        "- During the past two months, the accommodative monetary policy of major central banks has continued, and has even accelerated in the past month.",

        "Quantitative easing plans continue in the US, and the Bank of Japan announced at the beginning of April that it would double the rate of its bond purchase plan.",

        "During the course of the discussion on inflation, Committee members referred to inflation, as measured over the preceding 12 months, reaching negative levels, currently -0.3 percent.",
        "Among the contributing factors to the decline in consumer prices were the continued decline in the food and fruit and vegetables components, and the moderation in the increase in the housing component, with the latter remaining unchanged this month.",
        "Committee members assessed that the decline in prices, mainly in food prices, derives partially from the structural adjustment that has developed due to public pressure surrounding the cost of living.",
        "The committee members discussed the decline in prices of tradable goods, and expressed the opinion that it has been affected by the decline in energy and commodity prices around the world, and by the continued appreciation of the shekel during the first half of the year.",
        "These forces are being countered by the trend of depreciation in the shekel which began to develop about three months ago, but which, in the opinion of the Committee members, has not yet been fully reflected in prices.",
        "Committee members also discussed the moderation that has taken place in recent months in the increase of prices of nontradable goods—a reflection of the moderation in domestic demand.",
        "The Committee members related to the decline in inflation expectations for one year forward, which are below the lower bound of the price stability target range (1–3 percent), but emphasized that inflation expectations for longer terms remained anchored within the target range.",
        "The Committee members expressed their commitment to meeting the price stability target defined by the Bank of Israel Law.",
        "In their discussion on economic activity, Committee members noted that indicators point to a slowdown in the growth rate of the economy in the third quarter, further to its moderation in the second quarter, but agreed that the slowdown is derived to a large extent from the moderating effects of Operation Protective Edge.",
        "In addition to these effects, the continued contraction in exports and the continued virtual standstill in investments contributed to the slowdown in growth.",
        "In contrast, private consumption contributed to growth during the recent period.",

        "The Committee members noted that the Israeli economy is influenced to a large extent by the moderating growth rate of world trade.",
        "In this context, the Committee members noted that the International Monetary Fund revised its growth forecast for world trade downward.",
        "They discussed the possible ramifications of this scenario on exports and domestic growth, and assessed the implications of the possibility that world trade volumes will increase even less than the increase projected in the IMF’s revised forecast.",
        "In the discussion on the exchange rate, Committee members referred to the shekel’s depreciation in the past three months, and noted that it is partially derived from the interest rate reductions carried out by the Bank of Israel during that period, and by the strengthening of the dollar globally.",
        "The Committee members assessed that the effects of the depreciation have not been fully expressed, and that it is expected to continue to support exports and growth, and will continue to contribute to returning inflation to the price stability target range.",
        "Committee members noted that despite the depreciation, the prices of tradable goods continue to decline, and that this is partially explained by the decline in energy and commodities prices around the world.",
        "Continued depreciation can be expected to assist in offsetting the effects of these global factors on prices.",
        "With regard to the housing market, Committee members noted that the trend of decline in the volume of transactions continues, and is accompanied by moderation of the pace of taking out new mortgages.",
        "In parallel, there has been a slowdown in the rate of home price increases, and the latest data even indicated a decline in prices.",
        "Committee members attribute these developments to the uncertainty surrounding the plan to reduce the VAT on new homes for eligible buyers to zero.",
        "Committee members noted that it is difficult to assess how clarifications of the picture in this area will affect the housing market.",
        "Committee members noted that corporate bond spreads remained low, which may point to the underpricing of risks in this market.",
        "In addition, net new investment in corporate bond funds continues, though at low volumes.",
        "With regard to the fiscal situation, Committee members related to the fiscal expansion discussed as part of the debates on the 2015 budget.",
        "They assessed that a moderate fiscal expansion could strengthen economic activity, to the extent that it focuses on encouraging growth and domestic demand, but noted their concern of a prolonged increase in the deficit.",
        "In conclusion, Committee members were of the opinion that the effects of the interest rate reductions made in recent months have not yet been fully realized, and that the low interest rate supports real economic activity and prices.",
        "Moreover, the Committee members were of the opinion that the current level of the interest rate is in line with a flexible inflation target regime, which makes it possible—by law—to temporarily deviate from the price stability range.",
        "Since the interest rate tool is close to full use, the Committee decided to assess the use of additional tools as necessary.",
        "Following the discussion, the five members of the Monetary Committee voted on the Bank of Israel interest rate for November 2014.",
        "All five members supported keeping the interest rate at 0.25 percent.",
        "The decision to keep the interest rate for November 2014 unchanged at 0.25 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel's monetary policy, which is intended to return the inflation rate to within the price stability target of 1–3 percent a year over the next twelve months, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability.",
        "The path of the interest rate in the future depends on developments in the inflation environment, growth in Israel and in the global economy, the monetary policies of major central banks, and developments in the exchange rate of the shekel.",
        "measured over the preceding 12 months was negative 0.3 percent.",
        "Inflation expectations for the coming year, from various sources, declined to below the lower bound of the inflation target range, and two-year expectations are at the lower bound.",
        "Expectations for longer terms declined as well, though they are near to the midpoint of the target range.",
        "quarter slowed, and perhaps even declined.",
        "Most of the slowdown in activity derives from Operation Protective Edge.",
        "The Companies Survey points to a decline in activity in the third quarter in all industries, primarily in tourism.",
        "There was no substantial decline in confidence indices despite Operation Protective Edge, and there was improvement in the Purchasing Managers Index.",
        "of the dollar worldwide, the shekel weakened by 2.8 percent this month in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate, and it has weakened by about 4.1 percent since the beginning of the year.",
        "Continued depreciation will support a recovery in exports and in the tradable sector as a whole, and is expected to contribute to returning the inflation rate to within the target range.",
        "against the background of the increased uncertainty and volatility in various markets.",
        "Disappointing data were received this month in the eurozone, with an emphasis on its larger economies.",
        "In the US, the recovery in growth continues, though there are downside risks to the forecast.",
        "Based on market assessments, the timing of when the Fed will begin to raise the federal funds rate has been deferred to around October 2015. and there is a moderation in the rate of mortgages being taken out.",
        "Home prices declined by 1 percent in July-August, and their rate of increase over the 12 months ending in August slowed to 5 percent.",
        "It is difficult to assess the response that will occur when the uncertainty regarding the zero-VAT law is removed.",
        "Spreads in this market continue to indicate an apparent underpricing of risks.",
        "The Monetary Committee is of the opinion that the effects of the recent interest rate reductions, which brought the interest rate to a level of 0.25 percent, have not yet been fully reflected in activity and in inflation, and in view of that decided to keep the interest rate unchanged this month.",
        "The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli and global economies and in financial markets.",
        "The Bank will use the tools available to it and will examine the need to use various tools to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, and in this regard will continue to keep a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housing market."

        "The Committee noted that in February, the government announced several steps to reduce the cost of living and based on the Research Department analysis, their direct effect is expected to lead to a decline of 0.2 percentage points in the inflation rate.",
        "In addition, Committee members noted that inflation in recent months remained notably low compared to most OECD countries—it is at the bottom of the distribution of OECD countries.",
        "However, the Committee members assessed that at the current time, there are risks of inflation remaining around the upper part of the target for a longer time.",
        "The Committee discussed the solid activity data and the tight labor market.",
        "The members noted that the Israeli economy continues consistent economic activity at a high level alongside COVID-19 and against the background of the cyclicality of the morbidity waves.",
        "The activity is possible, among other things, in view of the adjustment of most industries to activity alongside the coronavirus.",

        "The Committee members discussed the forces that worked to weaken the shekel in the period reviewed—among others, the negative interest rate gaps between Israel and the world against the background of more “hawkish” policy in advanced economies worldwide and the geopolitical tensions in the world.",
        "In addition, they noted that the relation between financial market declines abroad and the dollar demand of institutional investors also contributed to the weakening of the shekel in the reviewed period.",
        "The Committee members noted the contractionary monetary policy in the world against the background of the high inflation environment.",
        "As such, market assessments are that the US Federal Reserve is expected to begin raising the interest rate already in March, and that the ECB is also expected to raise the interest rate this year.",

        "It appears that in addition to supply side factors such as the increase in oil and other commodity prices, imported inflation, and supply-chain disruptions, the increase in domestic demand is also accelerating inflation.",

        "In terms of the labor market, the Committee members noted that in March, the adjusted employment rate increased and the broad unemployment rate declined.",
        "Despite this, the Committee members emphasized that the average wage in the economy has not increased at a pace that is in line with the strong demand for employees.",

        "The Committee members claimed that the sharp increase in energy and commodity prices due to the escalation in eastern Europe is a risk factor for inflation in Israel.",
        "However, it was noted that an adverse impact on domestic demand is not expected as the scope of trade with Ukraine and Russia is not significant.",
        "However, there could be an indirect negative impact if Europe’s economy, as well as world trade, is notably adversely impacted.",

        "The inflation expectations and forecasts for the coming year derived from the capital market are within the target range and from other sources are around the upper bound of the target, and expectations derived from the capital market for the second year and onward are within the target range.",

        "The level of GDP continues to be higher than the trend line from before the COVID-19 crisis for the fourth consecutive quarter.",
        "Committee members noted the third-quarter growth that was positive, but lower than the level of the previous quarter, mainly because of a decline in private consumption of durable goods.",
        "In addition, the Committee discussed the labor market, which weakened slightly in the most recent data, but remains at a high environment reflecting a full employment environment.",
        "According on the Business Tendency Survey conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics, there is some decline in businesses’ expectations for expanding their number of employees, with a marked decline in the high-tech manufacturing and hotels industries.",

        "The Composite State of the Economy Index and the aggregate balance of the Business Tendency Survey remain on an upward trend, and credit card purchases in most industries have returned to their prewar level and even higher.",
        "However, the expansion of aggregate supply is slower than the development of demand, which is liable to lead to inflationary pressures.",
        "The Committee discussed the construction industry, which has a large weight in economic activity.",
        "Based on data presented to the Committee members, it could be seen that the return of building sites to activity is progressing, but the activity is still lower than its prewar level and is impacted on by the shortage of workers.",
        "In particular, it can be seen that the absorption of foreign workers from abroad is a complex process carried out gradually, and it is expected to take a prolonged period of time.",
        "It is important to maintain a high supply of construction over time in order to ensure the stabilization of housing prices.",

        "Against the background of indicators for a gradual recovery in the labor market and in demand (with variance among the principal industries) and in contrast, the supply limitations in some industries—the Committee assessed that there are several main risks to a possible acceleration of inflation: the development of the war and its impact on economic activity, depreciation of the shekel, limitations on construction industry activity, fiscal developments, and global oil prices.",

        "The increase in the extent of uncertainty also impacts on the extent of the adverse impact on the various financial indicators—in international comparison, Israel’s equity markets continued to underperform, and its government bond yields increased over the period reviewed, at a rate above the global trend.",
        "In the credit market, the slowdown in activity continues.",
        "In addition, risk indices in all credit activity segments are increasing somewhat, but still indicate a level that is not high relative to the past decade.",

        "In February, the employment rate remained stable at a level lower than before the war, and the employment rate net of those temporarily absent for economic reasons continued its upward trend.",
        "Based on rapid indicators from the Central Bureau of Statistics, the average wage per employee post continued to increase in February, and over the past 3 months the annual growth rate of nominal wages was 8.3 percent (the past 3 months compared with the corresponding period in the previous year).",
        "This pace is still impacted by a change in the composition of employees due to furloughs in preceding months and by the one-off additions to wages that were paid in January 2023.",
        "However, the impact of the change of the composition of employees on wages contracted in January and February, and the level of nominal wages is consistent with the pace forecast based on the prewar rate of increase.",
        "The most recent data also indicate the convergence of the real wage to the 2015–19 trend, pre-COVID-19.",
        "In the housing market, there was an increase in home prices in recent months, alongside continued moderation in rents.",
        "Despite the supply limitations in the construction industry and the sharp decline in residential construction investment, building starts in the fourth quarter of 2023 continued to be at a relatively high level in a long-term comparison (although there was a decline in the most recent data).",

        "Home prices increased in the past two months, after declining in the 10 months preceding that.",
        "The scope of transactions increased in January compared with the corresponding period of the previous year, and in March mortgage volume was high compared to preceding months.",
        "In contrast, the housing component in the CPI declined by 0.3 percent and the year over year rate of change continued to moderate, reaching 2.6 percent.",
        "Alongside these, construction industry activity is recovering gradually, but the industry is still not operating at its full potential.",
        "Supply limitations in the construction industry and the need for housing solutions for those forced to leave their homes are liable to weigh on the continued moderation of housing prices and rents going forward.",
        "The Committee discussed the Research Department’s updated macroeconomic forecast and fiscal developments.",
        "The Department assessed that GDP is expected to grow by 2 percent in 2024 and by 5 percent in 2025, similar to the January forecast.",
        "The forecast assumes that the direct economic effect of the war will last until the end of 2024 at a decreasing intensity.",
        "For 2025, the assumption is that there will not be additional direct effects of the combat.",
        "Similar to previous forecasts, the Department assumes that the lion’s share of the fighting will occur on one front.",
        "It is important to emphasize that the uncertainty regarding the various developments in the war could have a substantial effect on the forecast.",
        "The inflation rate assessed by the Department for 2024 increased slightly from previous forecasts.",
        "In view of the changes in the government’s budget, the debt to GDP ratio, one of the most important fiscal indicators, is expected to rise to a level of 67 percent in 2024 and to remain at a similar level during 2025 as well.",

        "The Committee discussed global conditions as well.",
        "The rate of economic activity worldwide surprised to the upside, against the background of stronger than expected activity in the US and some recovery in China.",
        "In contrast, the economic weakness continues in the eurozone.",
        "World trade increased for the first time in several months.",
        "The price of oil increased substantially during the period, and shipping costs, which soared against the background of the tension with the Houtis in the Red Sea, moderated.",
        "The inflation environment in numerous countries moderated, but in most of them it remains above central bank targets, in view of the inflation rate in services, which remained sticky and weighs on the convergence of inflation to the target range.",
        "In the US and the eurozone, the central banks kept the interest rate unchanged and signaled that the path of interest rate reductions will be slower and more gradual.",
        "In view of the recent developments, indicating a material increase in the extent of geopolitical uncertainty, the Monetary Committee decided to keep the interest rate unchanged.",
        "This policy is consistent with the one adopted by the Committee since the eruption of the war, a policy that is focused on stabilization of the markets and reduction of uncertainty, alongside price stability and support for economic activity.",
        "The Monetary Committee sets the interest rate in a process that includes two discussions––the first in a broad forum, and the second in a narrower one.",

        "All members of the Monetary Committee supported the decision.",
        "The discussion focused on the impacts of the geopolitical environment on the economy and on economic developments: inflation and inflation expectations, the level of economic activity in view of the war, the labor market, the Research Department’s forecast, the credit rating reductions, fiscal developments, developments in the financial markets and in the foreign exchange market, the housing market, and the global conditions.",

        "Inflation over the past 12 months was 3.6 percent in August.",
        "The year over year inflation rate net of energy and fruit and vegetables was more moderate, at 3.1 percent in August.",
        "The increase in the inflation rate is broad, and is reflected in both the tradable and nontradable components.",
        "Based on forecasters’ assessments, the inflation rate will continue to increase in the beginning of 2025, in view as well of the expected increase in VAT, and then will moderate toward the upper bound of the target range in the second half of the year.",
        "One-year inflation expectations and forecasts are around the upper bound of the target range.",
        "Expectations for the second year and onward are within the target range, in its upper portion.",
        "In the Committee’s assessment, that there are several risks for a possible acceleration of inflation: geopolitical developments and their impact on economic activity, including shekel depreciation, continued supply limitations, fiscal developments, and the increase in the oil prices worldwide.",
        "Economic activity indicators show that there has been some increase in activity in the third quarter, though the level of activity is still far from the trend line.",
        "Based on National Accounts data, second quarter economic growth was low, and was even revised slightly downward by the Central Bureau of Statistics.",
        "Accordingly, GDP is 3.3 percent below the long-term trend line.",
        "The Business Tendency Survey for September reflects a mixed trend among businesses, mainly against the background of the escalation in the North.",
        "The labor market remains tight, in view of the labor supply constraint.",
        "This is from a shortage of non-Israeli workers, and from the absence of workers who have been called up for military reserve service (the scope of which increased in September).",
        "The tight labor market is reflected in a low unemployment rate, a high job vacancy rate, and a rapid rise in wages.",
        "The Research Department updated its macroeconomic forecast.",
        "The Department assumed that the war will continue at a high intensity in the beginning of 2025 as well.",
        "In view of the below-forecast growth in the second quarter of 2024 and the recent intensification of the fighting, the growth forecast for 2024 was revised downward to and the shift of special US aid receipts to the coming years, the forecast for the deficit in the government budget for 2024 was revised upward to 7.2 percent.",
        "Alongside these, the inflation forecast for 2024 was revised upward to 3.8 percent.",
        "There is a particularly high level of uncertainty in the forecast, so that Committee members were presented with additional scenarios that include an extension of the war beyond the baseline scenario and/or a marked worsening in its intensity.",
        "The Department assesses the balance of risks with regard to the growth forecast to the downside, while with regard to inflation and the deficit the balance of risks tends to the upside.",
        "In the reviewed period, rating agencies Moody’s and S&P again reduced Israel’s credit rating, and added a negative rating outlook going forward.",
        "The agencies’ rating reductions emphasize the impact of the geopolitical reality, but also reflect the impact of fiscal policy management with an emphasis on the importance of the future policy framework.",
        "The rating agencies explained that their decision derived first and foremost from the geopolitical uncertainty, in view of the increase in the intensity of the war on the northern front, and the decreased chances for a ceasefire in Gaza.",
        "In addition, Moody’s also emphasized the process of passing the budget and the ability to carry out required fiscal adjustments, the difficulty in drafting the ultra-Orthodox, and the processes of changes in the judicial system.",
        "The Committee members emphasized that the trust of the markets and the international economic institutions is essential to the stability of the Israeli economy, and in order to ensure this trust it is important that the government act to deal with the issues raised in the reports.",
        "With regard to fiscal policy, the Committee members emphasized that the process of formulating the 2025 State budget is a positive, if challenging, step, against the background of the scope of required fiscal adjustments.",
        "In their assessment, the passage of a responsible budget for 2025 is a crucial component, particularly in such a period, which is required for strengthening the international markets’ trust.",
        "They added and emphasized that the forward looking planning of fiscal economic policy—one that will make it possible for the debt to GDP ratio to go back to declining in the next two years— is extremely important.",
        "The Committee discussed the impacts of the war on financial markets and the foreign exchange market.",
        "Israel’s risk premium continued to increase, and is at a historically high level.",
        "This is reflected in the CDS, which increased by about 30 points to a record of 165 points during the reviewed period, and in the spread that continues to widen between 10-year Israeli government (dollar) bonds and 10-year US Treasuries.",
        "It is important to note that a risk premium that is at a high level involves high financing costs—both in the public sector and the private sector—and is liable to reduce investments and to adversely impact economic growth.",
        "In the capital market as well, domestic equity indices remained essentially unchanged in the reviewed period, in contrast to an increase in most major equity indices worldwide.",
        "The cumulative underperformance of the domestic market vis-à-vis the world since the beginning of the war can still be seen.",

        "The Committee members emphasized that after a year it appears that the process of absorbing foreign workers into the industry is progressing slowly.",
        "This development is a challenge to economic activity because this industry has significant macroeconomic importance to the Israeli economy.",
        "The Committee discussed global conditions.",
        "The increase in geopolitical tension in the Middle East has so far had a moderate impact on global financial markets.",
        "Alongside that, there has been an increase in the most recent data on oil and natural gas prices.",

        "In the eurozone, second quarter growth was slightly lower than expectations.",

        "The Committee also discussed the effect of the development of inflation on the real interest rate, which reflects a restrictive monetary environment, even given the interest rate reduction.",
        "However, emphasis was placed on the fact that there are several risks to a possible acceleration of inflation: the effects of the war and its development on activity in the economy, a depreciation of the shekel, and fiscal policy that is of an expansionary nature as long as alongside the increase in defense and civilian expenditures, necessary budgetary adjustments would not be made.",

        "The Committee members discussed the importance of maintaining a high supply of construction over time, beyond the need to maintain activity in the immediate term, which will support stability in housing prices.",
        "The Committee also discussed the updated macroeconomic forecast compiled by the Research Department.",
        "The forecast was based on the assumption that the war’s direct economic impact reached its peak in the fourth quarter of 2023, and that the war will continue until the end of 2024, but at a decreasing magnitude.",
        "Similar to the previous forecasts, the forecast is based on the assumption that the war will be focused mainly on the Southern front.",
        "According to the forecast, GDP is expected to grow by 2 percent in each of 2023 and 2024, as in the November forecast, and by 5 percent in 2025, so that the output gap is expected to close in that year.",

        "The assessment with respect to the budget for 2024 is still exposed to uncertainty about government decisions regarding the budget’s handling of the security and civilian needs deriving from it.",
        "In view of the effects of the war, it is expected that the adverse impact in economic activity will lead to a decline in tax revenues, while in parallel the government’s expenditures on defense and on civilian assistance plans will increase.",
        "The Department’s assessment is that all these are expected to be reflected in a marked increase in the government’s budget deficit, estimated to be 4 percent of GDP in 2023, and is expected to total 5.7 percent of GDP in 2024 and 3.8 percent tin 2025.",
        "The Department assumed that the government would make cumulative adjustments, of a permanent nature, that will reach an annual scope of NIS 30 billion by the end of them should be realized this year already.",
        "This adjustment will lead to the debt to a GDP ratio expected to be 66 percent of GDP at the end of 2024 and 2025.",

        "Inflation over the past rate is more moderate, at 2.8 percent in July.",
        "The Committee noted that the increase in the pace of inflation mainly reflects the increase in the rate of change of prices of the nontradable components, which was 3.4 percent in annual terms, and 5.4 percent in the past three months (in annual terms).",
        "According to forecasters’ projections, inflation over the preceding 12 months is expected to increase and to remain above the upper bound of the target range at the beginning of 2025, partly due to the expected increase in taxes, and in mid-2025 to decline toward the upper bound of the target range.",

        "Expectations for the second year and onward are within the target range, in its upper part.",

        "The Committee noted that the uncertainty regarding the state budget for 2025 and the adjustments necessary to reduce the deficit on an on-going basis are contributing to the increase in the risk premium, and may make it difficult to return inflation to the target range.",
        "In the labor market, there is a supply constraint, partly in view of the lack of non-Israeli workers and the absence of workers who are serving in the defense forces or who are usually employed in the northern border area.",
        "This is contributing to a tight labor market with a low unemployment rate, a high job vacancy rate, and wages that are increasing at a rapid pace.",

        "The data show that GDP expanded by a moderate rate of 0.3 percent in quarterly terms second quarter distanced GDP from its trend line.",
        "GDP is about 3 percent lower than the trend line, and business product is about 5 percent lower.",
        "At the same time, GDP figures for the two previous quarters were revised upward, which offset some of the deviation from the trend line in view of the second quarter data.",
        "The level of economic activity is below the trend, mainly due to the lack of workers, primarily in the construction industry, in view of the war.",
        "GDP grew moderately in the second quarter, and business product even declined, mainly due to a decline in exports, where there was a decline in investments alongside high public demand due to the war.",
        "According to current indicators, the level of economic activity is expected to be moderate in the third quarter as well.",
        "These trends, alongside the increase in inflation, are consistent with an economy that is characterized by supply restrictions on activity, particularly in view of the fiscal expansion due to the war.",
        "The Committee discussed the impacts of the war on financial markets and on the foreign exchange market.",
        "During the reviewed period, the Fitch ratings agency announced a lowering of Israel’s credit rating from A+ to A, with a “negative” outlook.",
        "As the agency explained, the decision reflected the security situation, but also an assessment of the management of Israel’s fiscal policy, and emphasized the future policy path.",

        "In addition, the shekel traded with high volatility and high sensitivity to geopolitical developments.",

        "The Committee noted that the depreciation of the shekel continues to be a significant factor delaying the convergence of the inflation rate back to the target.",
        "The Committee’s assessment is that the trend of depreciation in the shekel partly reflects some increase in the economy’s risk premium, and to the extent that the trend of depreciation continues, it is liable to weigh on the convergence of inflation to its target.",

        "The Bank of Israel interest rate is expected to be 4.75 percent or 5 percent in the second quarter of 2024.",
        "The main risk to the forecast is the materialization of the scenario in which legislative and institutional changes will be accompanied by an increase in the State’s risk premium and continued depreciation of the shekel, with an adverse impact on exports, and a decline in domestic investments and demand for private consumption.",

        "The Committee discussed the factors that could lead to another slowdown in the inflation rate—renewed oil price declines and shekel appreciation—and the factors that may support continued price increases—mainly an acceleration in nominal wages.",
        "Committee members agreed that the risks of a renewed slowdown in the inflation rate are greater than the risk of acceleration in price increases, and that those risks may defer the return of the inflation rate to within the target range.",
        "The Committee discussed the causes for the continued moderate growth in the economy, as seen in, among other things, National Accounts data and the Companies Survey.",
        "Members noted that several of the factors that further moderated growth in the beginning of the year are likely to be temporary.",
        "First, the slowdown in public consumption is likely to be transitory if the government in fact approves a new and expansionary budget by the end of the year.",
        "Second, the decline in goods exports from Israel was affected by temporary labor disruptions in the chemicals industry.",
        "In addition to this temporary factor, Committee members agreed that the decline in goods exports derives mainly from the contraction of world trade in recent months.",
        "Finally, the Committee discussed the composition of growth and several members expressed concern that this composition is increasingly less reliant on the growth of exports, which is a growth driver in a small and open economy.",
        "Such a change in the composition is liable to negatively impact the increase in productivity in the economy, a development that will slow GDP growth, particularly when the economy is near to exhausting the increase in employment.",
        "The Committee discussed the continued appreciation of the shekel in the past month, and the impact of the appreciation on activity and employment in export industries, and in the tradable sector overall.",
        "Committee members were updated on developments in the Chinese economy and regarding the debt crisis in Greece, and agreed that despite the stabilization seen recently in those economies, the developments in those countries are still a risk to global economic recovery.",
        "The Committee discussed assessments regarding the date of initial increase in the federal funds rate and also discussed the continued monetary expansion in Europe.",
        "Members emphasized that Bank of Israel policy in the future depends on developments in the inflation environment, in growth in Israel and abroad, and in the exchange rate of the shekel.",
        "Interest rates abroad, alongside other data, impact on the policy to the extent that they impact on these developments and on the domestic economy.",
        "Committee members discussed the vigorous activity in the housing market and the elevated volume of new mortgages extended to home buyers.",
        "The Committee also discussed the positive effect of mortgage refinancing activity on the risk profile of existing mortgages.",
        "The Committee was updated on the government’s steps to formulate a new budget, and on concern that the deficit target in this budget will be high, and lead to an increase in the debt to GDP ratio.",
        "In conclusion, all Committee members supported leaving the interest rate unchanged, and they concurred that the current interest rate environment continues to support continued growth and the return of the inflation rate to the target range within a year.",
        "At the same time, the Committee’s decisions take developments in asset markets into account as well.",
        "Following the discussion, the five members of the Monetary Committee voted on the Bank of Israel interest rate for August 2015.",
        "All members supported keeping the interest rate at 0.1 percent.",
        "The decision to keep the interest rate for August 2015 unchanged at 0.1 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel's monetary policy, which is intended to return the inflation rate to within the price stability target of 1–3 percent a year over the next twelve months, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability.",
        "The path of the interest rate in the future depends on developments in the inflation environment, growth in Israel and in the global economy, and the exchange rate of the shekel, as well as on monetary policies of major central banks.",
        "The following are the main considerations underlying the decision: with the inflation target.",
        "Short-term inflation expectations from various sources are around the lower bound of the target range.",
        "Expectations for medium and longer terms remain entrenched near the midpoint of the target range.",
        "However, the decline in energy prices, which resumed in the past month, and the appreciation of the shekel, may defer the return of the inflation rate to within the target range.",

        "The second quarter Companies Survey supports this assessment.",

        "Various inflation expectations for the coming 12 months are around the center of the target range, after inflation expectations of forecasters and those based on over-the-counter CPI futures contracts were revised markedly down.",
        "Prices of commodities, particularly oil, declined sharply—a continuation of their declines in the previous two months.",
        "- Most indicators of real economic activity in Israel which became available this month point to continued moderate growth at an annual rate of about 3 percent, a rate similar to that of the first quarter.",
        "After the reduction in the interest rate for July, the Research Department staff forecast for GDP growth in 2012 remains 3.1 percent and the forecast for 2013 was revised to 3.4 percent.",
        "- This month macroeconomic data around the world indicated a further slowdown in growth, and projections of international organizations were revised downward.",
        "The level of economic risk in the world due to developments in Europe remained high, and with it the concern over negative effects on the domestic economy.",
        "- Interest rates in the major economies remain low, and markets are not pricing in any increases in interest rates this year by any of the leading advanced economies' central banks.",
        "Several central banks even reduced interest rates this month.",
        "Against the background of recent developments, the Fed announced the continuation of its easing plans, and there are increasing market assessments that several central banks will take additional easing steps.",

        "An open discussion follows, which ends with a vote on the level of the interest rate.",
        "According to the Bank of Israel Law, 5770-2010, (section 18(c)), the decision on the interest rate is reached by majority vote of the members of the Monetary Committee who participate in the voting.",
        "If the vote is tied, the chairperson (the Governor) has an additional vote.",
        "Indicators of real economic activity that became available this month support the assessment of a moderate growth rate of about 3 percent.",
        "These indicators are in line with the Research Department forecast of 3.3 percent GDP growth in 2012.",
        "At the same time, expectations from various surveys continue to reflect pessimism regarding the level of activity in the next few months.",
        "Data on revenue by industry in August indicate an increase in trade and services revenue, which was likely affected by the purchases brought forward ahead of the increase in the VAT rate.",

        "The Industrial Production Index for June-August rose by 14.2 percent in annual terms.",
        "Survey figures remained pessimistic with regard to future developments—the Purchasing Managers Index increased slightly this month, but remained at a level indicating sharp contraction in manufacturing activity, and expectations seen in the Bank Hapoalim and the Central Bureau of Statistics consumer confidence indices registered further deterioration, especially in the employment component.",
        "Labor market data which became available this month indicate continued moderate growth in employment, though in recent months there has been some stabilization in business sector employment.",
        "Employment data for July and August indicate an increase of 1.5 percent (seasonally adjusted) in the number of employed persons, compared with the second quarter, with an increase in the rate of part time positions compared with full time positions.",

        "Assuming that government expenditure does not surpass the original amount in the budget, the deficit this year, based on developments to date, is projected to be about 4 percent of GDP.",
        "The framework of expenditures expected during the remainder of the year raises some concern of a higher deficit, but it is likely that technical delays due to the bringing forward of elections, will slow or halt the increase in spending.",
        "Likewise, bringing the elections forward is expected to have a restraining effect on fiscal developments in the beginning of 2013, primarily in the first quarter, due to the limitation of monthly expenditure to one-twelfth of the previous year's budget until a new budget is passed.",
        "The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for September was unchanged.",
        "Forecasts projected an increase of 0.5 percent, on average.",
        "The main reason for the surprise compared with the forecasts was the decline in the pre-primary education component, which derived from the application of the law mandating free education to 3–4 year olds.",
        "This is a one-time factor resulting from policy.",
        "The effect was known in advance, but was not accounted for in most forecasts.",

        "Forecasts of the inflation rate over the next twelve months based on the average of forecasters' inflation predictions, and inflation expectations based on over-the-counter CPI futures contracts offered by banks, declined after the publication of the CPI for September, from around 2.5 percent to around 2.1 percent.",

        "Inflation expectations for two years and longer remained stable at around 2.5 percent.",
        "Expectations for the Bank of Israel interest rate one year from now derived from the Telbor (Tel Aviv Inter-Bank Offered Rate) market as well as expectations based on the average projection of forecasters, are for an interest rate of 2.1 percent.",

        "The total volume of new mortgages granted in September was NIS 3.2 billion, compared with NIS 5.8 billion in August.",
        "Part of the decline in new mortgage volume can be attributed to there having been fewer business days in the month due to the Jewish holidays, and to the fact that some transactions were brought forward ahead of the VAT increase which came into effect in September.",
        "The balance of housing debt was NIS 272 billion at the end of August, an increase of 6.9 percent since August of remained essentially unchanged, while interest rates in the unindexed variable rate segment again increased by about 0.1 percentage points, following a similar increase in August.",

        "The Bank of Israel Research Department's macroeconomic forecast for 2012 and 2013 was updated last month.",
        "The forecast (which was published as a separate press release together with the previous interest rate notice) projected GDP growth of 3.3 percent in is expected to remain unchanged until the end of 2013, and the inflation rate over the four quarters ending with the third quarter of 2013 is expected to be 2.6 percent.",

        "In its announcement, the IMF wrote that this forecast relies on optimistic assumptions—that the eurozone would succeed in solving the problems of the countries in crisis within a reasonable amount of time, and that the United States would succeed in dealing with its budget problems (the \"fiscal cliff\") and would outline a credible policy for returning to a path of sustainable debt.",

        "After the discussion on the interest rate for November 2012, four of the Committee members voted in favor of lowering the interest rate by 0.25 percentage points to 2 percent, while two Committee members voted in favor of keeping the interest rate unchanged.",

        "Committee members were divided in their assessment of developments in the Israeli economy, with some identifying a further slight decline in the rate of growth in recent months.",
        "The pessimism seen in the various surveys (such as the Business Tendency Survey, the Purchasing Managers Index, and the Consumer Confidence Index) raises concerns of a further slowdown.",
        "At the same time, the effect of the fiscal restraint expected until the State Budget is approved is liable to have a negative impact on growth rates during the next few months.",
        "Other Committee members assess that following the slowing of the growth rates that took place a year ago, there has not been further slowing, despite the negative developments in the global economy.",

        "However, growth forecasts by the IMF, among others, regarding most countries, were lowered.",
        "At the same time, some of the Committee members noted that developments in the global financial markets did not indicate further worsening.",
        "In order to support their growth, various countries have reduced their interest rates, and other countries have adopted quantitative easing measures.",
        "The effective interest rate gap has therefore widened, which supports exchange rate appreciation.",
        "However, it was noted that in the past week, the shekel's appreciation has been halted.",
        "In light of the increase in home prices in recent months and the increase in the number of transactions and volume of new mortgages against the background of the low interest rates in the mortgage market, the Committee members expressed their concern over a renewed upward trend in home prices, and discussed possible steps.",
        "In this framework, the Bank of Israel's Supervisor of Banks notified the members of the Monetary Committee of his decision to issue a directive limiting the loan-to-value Committee assessment is that the Supervisor of Banks' directive will serve to moderate the effects of lower interest rates on the home prices.",
        "The main argument in favor of lowering the interest rate for November is that this could serve to encourage growth in the economy, and to help the economy deal with any further growth rate moderation in the future, as shown by various surveys, taking into account the delayed influence of monetary policy.",
        "Furthermore, since actual inflation as well as inflation expectations for the next year are near the midpoint of the inflation target range, lowering the interest rate would not endanger price stability.",
        "The main argument in favor of leaving the interest rate unchanged is that since there has been no significant change in the economy's growth rate over the past few months, and primarily in light of the weakness of the global economy, the interest rate, after having been reduced by half a percentage point since the beginning of the year, appears appropriate for the economy.",
        "Those in support of leaving the interest rate unchanged believe that no evidence of a further slowdown in economic activity has accumulated thus far, and noted the negative effects that may develop in the economy from a low interest rate over an extended period.",
        "Following the discussion, the six members of the Monetary Committee voted on the Bank of Israel's interest rate for November 2012.",
        "Four of the Committee members voted in favor of lowering the interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, and two Committee members voted in favor of leaving the interest rate unchanged.",
        "In its announcement, the Bank highlighted the following main considerations underlying the decision to lower the interest rate for November by 0.25 percentage points to 2 percent: - Indicators which became available this month continue to strengthen the assessment that there has been some moderation in the growth rate to about 3 percent.",
        "These indicators are consistent with the Research Department's forecast which was published last month.",
        "Expectations seen in consumer surveys and the Business Tendency Survey are pessimistic and indicate predictions of further moderation in activity.",
        "Economic activity in the first few months of 2013 is expected to be affected by the fiscal restraint inherent in the monthly expenditure limitation until a new budget is approved.",
        "- The inflation environment moderated in the past six months, with the continued slowing of the increase in the housing index (primarily representing rents).",
        "The rate of inflation over the previous twelve months was at the midpoint of the inflation target range.",
        "Most inflation expectations for the coming year are also at the midpoint of the target range, against the background of the decline in commodity prices and, in contrast, the expected increases in food prices.",
        "- Against the background of the debt crisis in Europe, the level of economic risk from around the world remains high, and with it the concerns over negative effects on the local economy.",

        "- Home prices, as measured over the past 12 months, increased by 1.4 percent.",
        "However, home prices increased by 0.6 percent in the past month, and by 2.9 percent over the past 6 months.",
        "The increases in home prices in recent months and the continued growth in housing credit raise concerns of a continued increase in home prices.",
        "Against the background of the necessity to provide further support for economic activity and in the absence of inflationary pressure, the Monetary Committee decided to lower the interest rate by 0.25 percentage points.",
        "In light of the increases in housing prices in recent months and the continued growth in housing credit against the backdrop of low interest rates in the mortgage market, the Supervisor of Banks decided to issue a directive limiting the loan-to-value ration in order to support the stability of the banking system.",
        "The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli and global economies and in financial markets, particularly in light of the continuing high level of uncertainty in the global economy.",

        "If the vote is tied, the chairperson (the Governor) has an additional vote.",
        "Economic indicators that became available this month show a continued slowdown in activity and in demand.",
        "For some of the data, e.g., imports and exports of goods and services, it seems that in the last two quarters these actually fell below their levels in the first half of the year.",
        "The Bank of Israel's Companies Survey for the fourth quarter indicates that the rate of increase of business activity continued to moderate, as it did the previous quarter.",
        "The Central Bureau of Statistics monthly survey of business trends also indicates a further slowdown in business activity in December, continuing the trend which began in May December to 42.7 points, continuing its November fall.",

        "However, based on partial data from the Bank of Israel Companies Survey, construction companies report a sharp increase in the difficulty of selling apartments.",
        "The moderation in the rate of increase of home prices comes against the background of the continued increase in the number of building starts, the lagged effect of the increase in the interest rate, measures introduced by the Bank of Israel affecting mortgages, and steps taken by the Ministry of Finance in real estate taxation.",
        "The effect of these moves, as well as land marketing efforts by the Ministry of Construction and Housing and the Israel Land Administration, is expected to continue to be reflected in the future.",
        "The Bank of Israel Research Department staff forecast published in December predicts an inflation rate of 2.1 percent in 2012, an average interest rate in the last quarter of 2012 of 2.2 percent, and GDP growth in 2012 of 2.8 percent.",
        "The Research Department's assessment at the time of the forecast was that the housing component of the CPI (representing rents) will increase 4 percent in 2012.",
        "From the previous monetary policy discussion held on December 25, 2011, through January 20, 2012, the exchange rate of the shekel against the dollar was almost unchanged, in contrast with the strengthening of most major currencies against the dollar; the shekel appreciated by 1 percent against the euro.",
        "In terms of the nominal effective exchange rate the shekel remained almost unchanged.",
        "From the previous monetary policy discussion held on December 25, 2011, to January market indices in advanced and emerging economies.",
        "The Tel-Bond 20 Index increased by 1.5 percent, and the Tel-Bond 40 Index by 2.5 percent.",
        "This month there were no net withdrawals from mutual funds specializing in corporate bonds.",
        "The macroeconomic data on the eurozone continue to indicate the start of a recession, the most prominent being Germany's negative growth rate of 0.25 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011.",
        "Investment houses' forecasts of growth in the eurozone in 2012 average a negative 0.7 percent, and concern over the negative impact of fiscal restraint on growth has increased.",
        "In contrast, relatively positive macroeconomic data on the US economy were published this month, in particular data relating to growth and employment, indicating a trend of recovery and growth.",
        "Most data on the emerging market economies published this month were better than those of the previous month, but they still show a slowdown in the rate of growth.",
        "Against the background of the European Central Bank (ECB) liquidity tender in December, and despite the downgrading of the credit rating of nine European countries, a positive atmosphere prevailed in the markets.",
        "This was evident in the successful issues of debt in European countries, including Italy, Spain and France, in the narrowing of the credit spreads of peripheral countries, and in rises in stock markets.",
        "Nevertheless, Greece's situation, against the background of the difficulties encountered in the attempts to restructure its debt arrangements, poses a threat.",
        "Data on world trade show a continued fall in its volume in October, and forecasts of world trade growth were reduced.",
        "There was another very small increase in commodity prices this month, partly related to the developments regarding a boycott of Iran.",
        "Inflation forecasts for Europe and the US rose slightly this month, but are still very close to 2 percent.",
        "Participants in the discussion dealt with several main issues: (1) The slowdown in growth in Israel; (2) developments in the global economy and their effect on Israel's economy; (3) the housing market; and (4) the exchange rate.",
        "With regard to real activity in Israel, the participants in the discussion agreed that the data that became available this month continue to indicate a slowdown in growth deriving from slowdowns in domestic demand and in exports.",
        "Regarding exports, reference was made to the fall in the level of manufacturing production, the downward adjustment of the Tech Pulse Index in the US, and the decline in world trade in recent months—indicators which point to a decline in export activity and export demand.",
        "In relation to domestic demand, participants spoke of the drop in turnover in the trade and services sectors, an indicator of private consumption; the measured decline in apartment prices; and the lower level of inflation, all these supporting the assessment that there has been a slowdown in the rate of growth of domestic demand.",
        "In assessing the state of the global economy, Committee members indicated positive and negative developments that accumulated over the previous month.",
        "On the negative side, Committee members expressed concern about world trade figures, which indicated continued contraction in world trade volume in recent months, and the revision downward in the forecast of the rate of world trade growth, which are expected to continue to negatively impact exports.",
        "Similarly, it was noted that the level of uncertainty regarding developments in the crisis in Europe continues to be high.",
        "On the positive side were the recent increases in stock markets in Israel and abroad, which likely point to future improvement in the state of the global economy, as well as encouraging consumption and employment figures in the US.",
        "Committee members assessed that a turnaround in the housing market is beginning to appear.",
        "Members pointed to the measured decline in home prices, the decline in volume of new mortgages granted, as well as the relatively high level of housing starts.",
        "In light of these developments, and the limitation on the share of the floating rate component of mortgages, the effect of a reduction in the interest rate is expected to be moderate.",
        "In addition, they assessed that the source of funding difficulties in the real estate market is a result of the risk in the sector.",
        "These find expression in, among other things, the Bank of Israel's Companies Survey, in which companies in the industry report a sharp increase in the demand constraint they face, along with a more moderate increase in the credit constraint as well.",
        "On the foreign currency market, it was noted that recently the nominal effective exchange rate has been stable, and this environment is expected to continue.",
        "Among other things, the decline in the surplus in the current account of the balance of payments and the increase in exposure by institutional investors to assets abroad were mentioned.",
        "With that, it was noted that there can still be significant occurrences in the market, due to the uncertainty regarding the development of the crisis in Europe and the geopolitical situation.",
        "The primary factor in favor of reducing the interest rate is the continued slowdown in the growth of the Israeli economy, which was expressed both in domestic demand as well as in exports, and the assessment that this slowdown is expected to continue.",
        "As such, since the interest rate has a lagged effect, it should be reduced now rather than later.",
        "Those who supported this view noted as well the downward revision of global growth forecasts, and the slowdown in growth of domestic demand, which are expressed in, among other things, a decline in turnover among trade and services industries, and a decline in home prices.",
        "It was also noted that the environment of inflation near the center of the target range allows an interest rate reduction, and that the Bank of Israel's limitations imposed on the mortgages sector weakened the transmission from the Bank of Israel interest rate to home prices.",
        "In contrast, one Committee member claimed that in his opinion there is no real deterioration in the state of the economy and that it is possible to wait with an interest rate reduction until there is clarification regarding the dimensions of the crisis in Europe.",
        "Following the discussion, the six members of the Monetary Committee voted on the rate of interest for February 2012.",
        "Five members of the Committee voted in favor of reducing the interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, and one Committee member voted in favor of keeping the interest rate at its current level.",
        "In announcing the decision, the Bank of Israel emphasized the following points that led to the decision to reduce the interest rate by 0.25 percentage points to 2.5 percent for February 2012: The following were the main considerations underlying the decision: - The indicators that became available this month show that the slowdown in activity and in demand that started during the second half of 2011 continues.",
        "The slowdown in growth of Israel's economy is seen in exports and in domestic demand, against the background of weakness in the global economy and the significant uncertainty existing in the global environment, primarily around Europe.",
        "In addition, surveys of expectations, both of consumers and companies, show that the slowdown in the rate of growth is expected to continue.",
        "- Actual inflation over the previous twelve months continues to settle firmly within the target range.",
        "Inflation figures indicate a marked slowdown in inflation in the second half of 2011.",
        "The Bank of Israel expects the rate of inflation over the previous twelve months to remain within the target inflation range in 2012.",
        "Forecasters' inflation predictions for the coming twelve months and inflation expectations measured from the capital market are close to the midpoint of the target range.",
        "- Data on economic activity in Europe are consistent with the assessments that the eurozone will slip into a recession in 2012.",
        "Figures of actual global trade show a continued volume decline in October.",
        "Forecasts for world trade growth in 2012 were revised downward.",
        "The risk of default of some European countries as reflected by the high yields on their bonds and by their CDS spreads were expressed this month in the downgrading of the sovereign credit rating of major European economies.",
        "Some optimism has been evident recently in global financial markets, primarily against the background of steps taken by the ECB, but uncertainty regarding the debt crisis remains high, which also affects the level of uncertainty about developments in the Israeli economy.",
        "- Interest rates in the major economies are low, and the markets are not pricing in an increase in the interest rate in the coming year in any of the central banks of the large advanced economies.",
        "The Fed, it will be recalled, declared that the federal funds rate will remain at a near-zero level till mid-2013 at least.",
        "The Bank of England and the ECB continued their efforts to increase liquidity.",
        "- Home prices continued to decline at a moderate pace.",
        "The limitation that the Bank of Israel imposed relating to the permitted share of housing loans at floating interest rates reduces the effect of cuts in the Bank of Israel interest rates on the average interest rate on mortgages.",
        "The decision to cut the interest rate to 2.5 percent for February is consistent with an interest rate policy aimed at keeping inflation within the price stability target range and is intended to support real economic activity, against the background of the slowdown in global demand.",
        "The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in Israel's economy and the global economy and in financial markets.",
        "The Bank will use the tools available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, including keeping a close watch on developments in the asset markets.",
        "Further evidence of the deep debt crisis and the threats to the continued recovery of the global economy and Europe's financial stability came this month from the S&P credit rating agency, which lowered the ratings of many countries, including France.",
        "The S&P announcement listed nine eurozone countries whose ratings were lowered, with France and Austria being downgraded to AA+, losing their perfect credit rating.",
        "Italy's and Spain's rating were cut by two notches, Italy's to BBB+, and Spain's to A, and Portugal's credit rating is now lower than investment grade.",
        "The S&P announcement emphasized that contractionary measures alone without concurrent steps to support growth were likely to intensify Europe's debt crisis and to lead to further downgrading of credit ratings.",
        "S&P also reduced its 2012 growth forecast for Europe from 0.4 percent (the forecast in December) to 0.2 percent (which is still a more optimistic forecast than those of the investment houses), and assessed the risk of a recession at 40 percent.",
        "The markets had anticipated such a step, as can be seen from their relatively moderate reaction to the announcement, as S&P had already given a warning regarding this probable development at the meeting of European leaders at the beginning of December.",
        "The background to the S&P announcement was provided by the growth data published this month, indicating that the eurozone had entered a recession.",
        "The GDP of Germany, the eurozone's strongest economy, contracted by 0.25 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011.",
        "Furthermore, growth forecasts for 2012 are for a contraction of situation in the eurozone that emerges from the data published this month continues to be a negative one.",
        "The CPI, retail sales and manufacturing output continue to be weaker than expected, and the high rate of unemployment, 10.3 percent, remained unchanged.",
        "Although the purchasing managers index in the manufacturing sector was better than expected, it is still below the level that would indicate expansion.",
        "It is worth mentioning that some European macroeconomic data exceeded expectations: unemployment in Germany declined slightly to 6.8 percent in December, from 6.9 percent in November.",
        "The threat to the stability of Europe is likely to increase soon against the background of Greece's inability to come to an agreement with creditors in general and with the Institute for International Finance (IFF) in particular about the size of the \"haircut\" they would need to absorb.",
        "The IMF warned that if Greece does not reach an agreement, it would not receive the next tranche in the rescue program, and thus would not be able to make the repayment of €14 billion due in March.",
        "A 50 percent haircut is the minimum required to make Greece's debt sustainable, an amount equivalent to 120 percent of Greece's GDP up to 2020.",
        "It should be noted that the assessments are that hedge funds, after purchasing some of the Greek debt, would prefer to allow Greece to go bankrupt, whereby they would receive the insurance against default due to them deriving from the insurance policies they purchased.",
        "Alternatively they hope that they would receive the full value of the bonds if a sufficiently large number of creditors would join them in refusing to participate in a debt arrangement.",
        "This stand places the hedge funds in direct conflict with the IMF, which is interested in reducing Greece's financing costs to a level that would enable the government to meet its commitments.",
        "Despite the S&P decision, the main factor that still seems to contribute to a positive atmosphere in the markets was the ECB liquidity tender held at the end of December, and the additional tender due to be held next month.",
        "The high liquidity in the system is directed into low-risk assets, such as German bonds traded with negative yields for periods up to a year, alongside assets with higher risks, as can be seen in the yields on government bonds of the peripheral European countries and in the results of those countries' bond issues.",
        "The yield curves of Italian and Spanish bonds continued to become steeper: yields on short-term Italian bonds dropped by up to 168 basis points short-term bonds dropped by up to 142 bps and by up to 50 bps on medium- and longterm bonds.",
        "The marked decline in short-term yields was an indication of calm and the return of investors' confidence in those countries' ability to repay debts.",
        "The Italian government's issues of debt at the end of December were successful, reflected in low yields and improved coverage ratios.",
        "The debt issues of Spain and Belgium were also considered successful, and in France's first long-term bond issue of 2012 demand exceeded supply.",
        "Following the announcement of no change in the interest rate (1 percent) in the eurozone this month, as expected, the President of the ECB said that he was pleased at the market response to the liquidity tenders, and that he expects significant demand in the next tender at the end of February.",
        "He did not announce any new policy measures, but declared that the ECB would do all it could to ease the banks' financing ability and to avoid a credit squeeze, and stated that the ECB was prepared to act as necessary.",
        "Based on the above, investors assess that the interest rate is likely to be reduced to less 1 percent.",
        "Nonetheless, politicians and analysts are critical of the fact that the ECB doe not increase its involvement in the government bond market.",
        "This month, for the first time, the head of the Fitch credit rating agency called on the ECB to increase its purchases of problem bonds of eurozone countries, especially those of Italy, in order to prevent the collapse of the eurozone, which according to him would probably be disastrous for the global economy.",
        "Most macroeconomic data for the US published this month continued to be positive, particularly consumption and employment data, and to indicate that the US economy is on a growth trend.",
        "Consumption in the US––the engine that drives the US economy––continues to improve, with consumer credit surging in November by a surprising $20 billion, an increase of 10 percent in annual terms, the highest increase in the last ten years.",
        "The consumer confidence index and the University of Michigan confidence index for December both rose more than expected.",
        "Retail sales excluding vehicles, however, actually declined by 0.2 percent in December, whereas an increase had been expected.",
        "The Beige Book for the period between mid-November and end December (including the important holiday trading period) shows that economic activity grew at a modest to moderate pace, an improvement from the previous report, due to an increase in retail sales compared with the level in the previous years, and an increase in demand in the services and motor industries.",
        "The report describes inflationary pressures as limited.",
        "Production in the US is also improving; the Chicago purchasing managers index for December was almost unchanged, whereas a decline had been expected, and the ISM survey of the manufacturing sector showed a larger-than-expected increase.",
        "A largerthan-expected increase was also recorded for infrastructure expenditure in November, and wholesale stocks increased moderately in December, by less than had been expected.",
        "Increased production alongside higher consumption indicate the continuation of the recovery trend in the US economy.",
        "The recovery in the labor market is also continuing.",
        "The rate of unemployment dropped by more than expected, from 8.7 percent to 8.5 percent, and the number of additional workers in the non-agricultural sector greatly exceeded expectations.",
        "The real estate market also continued to recover.",
        "The number of pending home sales increased by more than expected in November.",
        "The Case-Schiller index of home prices shows a decline in October, and the interest rate on 30-year mortgages is at an unprecedented low of 3.91 percent.",
        "It should be mentioned, however, that the tech-pulse index of activity in the IT sector in the US was adjusted downwards retroactively this month, in effect showing contraction in that sector since October (in contrast with the positive trend evident till then).",
        "A main threat to continued growth in the US is the fact that the country is on the eve of an election year, which may make it difficult for the President to get Congress to approve programs to boost growth, to raise the deficit ceiling, or to extend the tax reliefs in February for another year.",
        "All of these, it may be assumed, will eventually be passed, but the difficulties encountered en route may undermine investors' confidence.",
        "The trade deficit widened in November to $47.8 billion, some 10.4 percent more than expected, following four months in which it had contracted.",
        "The President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said that data on the US rate of growth were likely to make the Fed raise the interest rate earlier than mid2013, the date until which it had committed itself not to change the interest rate.",
        "He expected the GDP of the US to increase at an annual rate of 3 percent in the next two years, while the investment houses on average expect growth of 2.2 percent.",
        "In contrast, investors expect the members of the Federal Open market Committee level from mid-2013 to mid-2014, in light of the minutes of the FOMC meeting in December in which members of the committee discussed the publication of their assessments of the interest rate path.",
        "The yield on issues of 10-year government bonds, 1.9 percent, was the lowest ever in such tenders, indicating investors desire to continue to hold safe haven assets.",
        "Most of the data published this month in emerging markets were better than last month's, but still show a slowdown in growth.",
        "In China GDP grew at an annual rate of 8.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011, exceeding expectations of 8.7 percent growth, compared with a rate of 9.8 percent in industrial output encourage the markets to believe that this was only a soft landing.",
        "Nevertheless, the fact that the HSBC purchasing managers index for December remained below 50 points, the sharp decline in the rate of increase of imports, the decline in the annual rise in the CPI to 4.1 percent, the lowest rate for 15 months, the decline in the rise of the producers price index to an annual 1.7 percent, and the continued fall in house prices, which declined by 0.25 percent in December, all these increase concern over a downward price trend and a slowdown in China's economy, and make it imperative for the government to adopt expansionary measures.",
        "Against this background the market assessment is that China will reduce the bank reserve ratio by another 50 basis points before the end of this month.",
        "The statement by the Chinese Premier that the government will refine its monetary policy to deal with the slowdown in 2012 and that the economy is entering a difficult period strengthen the above assessment.",
        "It is expected that in addition to the monetary easing, the government will take additional steps to boost the economy, such as cutting taxes on small and medium-sized businesses, and introducing incentives to increase consumer spending.",
        "The steep drop in imports is likely to have a negative impact on global growth, as China is one of the largest importers.",
        "The increase in India's exports in November was less than that in October, imports increased, and manufacturing production showed a very positive performance, calming concern caused by the contraction in the previous month.",
        "It appears that as the downgrading of the credit ratings in Europe was expected and had been taken into account by the markets, and in particular in light of the steps taken by the ECB last month to increase liquidity in the markets, and the positive picture regarding the US economy, there was a risk-on atmosphere in the markets.",
        "Share price indices in the US rose by up to 6.1 percent during the period under review showing the steepest increases.",
        "Share price indices in the emerging market economies showed good increases.",
        "In the government bond markets, the yield on 10-year US Treasury securities declined in the month to date from 2.03 percent to only 1.85 percent, and the yield on German bonds fell from 1.96 percent to only 1.8 percent.",
        "Yield gaps between bonds of some European countries, and particularly Italy and Spain, and German bonds narrowed, mainly for short maturities.",
        "Most of the major currencies strengthened against the dollar, by up to 5.2 percent, with the exception of the euro, which weakened by 1 percent.",
        "In the commodities market, the price of a barrel of Brent crude oil increased by 3.9 percent, and the price of an ounce of gold increased by 3.6 percent.",
        "The index of commodity prices excluding energy rose by 1.4 percent, and the agricultural commodities price index rose by 3.7 percent.",
        "In the process of making the monthly interest rate decision by the Monetary Committee, discussions are held at two levels––the first in a broad forum, and the second in a narrower one.",
        "In the broad-forum discussion, the relevant background economic conditions are presented, including real, monetary and financial developments in Israel’s economy, and developments in the global economy.",
        "Participants in this discussion include the three members of the Monetary Committee from the Bank—the Governor, the Deputy Governor and the Senior Advisor to the Governor—and the three members of the Monetary Committee from the public.",
        "Other participants in the discussion are the Directors of the Research and Market Operations Departments, and economists from various departments who prepare and present the material for discussion.",
        "The data, estimates and assessments in this report are those that were available at the time of the discussions.",
        "In the narrow forum, which consists of the Monetary Committee and the two Directors of departments, the Directors of the Research and Monetary Operations Departments present their recommendations regarding the interest rate.",
        "An open discussion follows, which ends with a vote on the level of the interest rate.",
        "According to the Bank of Israel Law, 5770-2010, (section 18(c)), the decision on the interest rate is reached by majority vote of the members of the Monetary Committee who participate in the voting.",
        "If the vote is tied, the chairperson (the Governor) has an additional vote.",
        "Although economic indicators that became available this month show a mixed trend, the general assessment is that in the fourth quarter and in January there was a continued slowdown in the rate of growth of activity and of demand.",
        "These indicators are consistent with the Bank of Israel forecast for growth of 2.8 percent in 2012.",
        "The first estimate of National Accounts figures for the fourth quarter (in annual terms) shows that GDP increased 3.2 percent, compared with 3.8 percent in the previous quarter; business sector product increased 3.3 percent, compared with 5 percent in the previous quarter, private consumption expenditure declined by 4 percent, compared with an increase of 0.2 percent in the previous quarter; fixed capital formation by industries declined by 3.1 percent, compared with an increase of 14.9 percent in the previous quarter; and exports declined 17.4 percent, compared with a decline of 7.7 percent in the previous quarter.",
        "(It should be noted that these are first estimates, and experience has shown that they are subject to significant revisions).",
        "The Bank of Israel's Companies Survey for the fourth quarter indicates stability in the net balance of activity for the second consecutive quarter.",
        "The Central Bureau of Statistics monthly survey of business trends and its consumer confidence indicator continued to be negative in January as well, though with some improvement.",
        "However, the Composite State-of-the-Economy Index increased 0.2 percent in January, due to stability and a slight improvement in manufacturing production, trade and services revenue, and imports of production inputs.",
        "VAT revenues from domestic production were stable, compared with a decline of 3.5 percent in the previous month.",
        "The Purchasing Managers Index compiled by Bank Hapoalim declined in January to the low level of 36.3 points, continuing its decline of November and December.",
        "Labor market data indicate a high level of employment and a low unemployment rate.",
        "The job vacancy rate, which reflects the demand for employees, was relatively low ranging 2.5–3 percent.",
        "Nominal wages increased 1.4 percent in September– November, compared with the preceding three months, and real wages increased 1.1 percent.",
        "Health tax receipts, which provide an indication of total wage payments, were effect of legislative changes), and despite an increase compared with December, there is still some moderation from the pace of increase in the beginning of 2011.",
        "New claims for unemployment benefits increased in December, continuing the trend of increase since the middle of 2011.",
        "Goods exports declined 6.3 percent and good imports increased 4.5 percent in January, compared with December.",
        "Total tax receipts in January were NIS 2.9 billion above the seasonal path consistent with the tax revenues forecast in the budget.",
        "The better than forecast receipts were due mainly to one-time revenues from direct taxes.",
        "In light of the projected growth rate in budget (4 percent), then even if recent expenditure commitments by the government do not lead total government expenditure to deviate from the ceiling set by law, the current pace of tax receipts (net of one time revenues) is expected to lead to a deficit in 2012 of 3.3 percent of GDP, above the deficit ceiling of 2 percent of GDP set at the end of 2010.",
        "The Consumer Price Index (CPI) was unchanged in January; the average of the forecasts was for a decline of 0.1–0.2 percent.",

        "One year forward inflation expectations as calculated from the capital markets (breakeven inflation) were 2.6 percent on average in February, a 0.3 percent increase from the previous month.",
        "With that, this series is affected by seasonal factors, due to technical difficulties.",
        "As such, it can be assessed that the expectations estimate is apparently slightly biased upward this month.",
        "Inflation expectations calculated from the capital markets for the medium term were 2.5 percent, and for longer terms were Forecasters' inflation predictions for the next twelve CPI readings average 2.4 percent, an increase from their projections last month.",

        "Expectations for the Bank of Israel interest rate one year from now, based on the Telbor (Tel Aviv Inter-Bank Offered Rate) market, remained steady this month as well at 2.4 percent, and the average of forecasters' predictions of the interest rate in one year's time was that the Bank of Israel interest rate for March will remain unchanged.",

        "Yields on unindexed government bonds increased by about 10 basis points (b.p.)",

        "The interest rate reduction last month by the Bank of Israel, and the exit of nonresidents from makam, which continued this month, acted in opposite directions on _makam yields._ _Makam yields decreased during the_ period by 5–10 b.p.",
        "along the entire curve, and the yield for one year was around 2.44 percent.",
        "The yield differential between Israeli 10-year government bonds and equivalent 10year US Treasury securities widened slightly to 260 b.p.",
        "in the previous month.",

        "Housing credit extended in the twelve months ending in January was 2.1 percent lower than that advanced in the twelve months to December, continuing the decline from the peak level in May.",
        "The share of unindexed floating rate mortgages granted in January was 26.9 percent.",
        "Interest rates on price-indexed mortgages declined slightly, and interest rates on nominal mortgages were unchanged.",
        "The housing component of the CPI (representing rents), increased by 0.3 percent in January.",
        "In the twelve months to January it increased by 5 percent.",
        "Home prices, which are published in the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of home prices but are not included in the CPI, increased in November–December by 0.6 percent, the first increase after three months of decline in which the cumulative decline was 1.4 percent.",

        "However, based on data from the Bank of Israel Companies Survey for the fourth quarter of 2011, construction companies report a sharp increase in the difficulty of selling apartments.",
        "The moderation in the rate on increase of home prices in recent months comes against the background of the continued increase in the number of building starts, the lagged effect of the increase in the interest rate, measures introduced by the Bank of Israel affecting mortgages, and steps taken by the Ministry of Finance in real estate taxation.",
        "These moves, together with land marketing efforts by the Ministry of Construction and Housing and the Israel Land Administration, are expected to continue to have an effect in the future.",
        "The Bank of Israel Research Department staff forecast compiled in December projects an inflation rate of 2.1 percent in 2012, and an average interest rate in the last quarter of 2012 of 2.2 percent.",

        "The rate of inflation over the preceding 12 months has been at the center of the target range in recent months.",
        "With that, inflation expectations derived from the capital market (break even inflation) have increased markedly in the past two months to 2.6 percent.",
        "This was in parallel to a much more moderate increase in inflation expectations of professional forecasters.",
        "Apparently, the greater increase in the breakeven inflation rate than the average prediction of the forecasters was partially the result of technical difficulties in the estimation, which created a seasonal upward bias in the breakeven rate in the past two months.",
        "Likewise, inflation expectations since August 2011 had been biased downward.",
        "Thus, it is assessed that while there was in fact an increase in inflation expectations, based on projections of increasing prices of fuel and energy, it was lower than what was observed in the figure derived from the capital markets.",
        "It is assessed that in the fourth quarter of 2011 and in January 2012 the slowdown in the rate of growth of real activity and demand continued, despite the fact that this month several indicators also became available which point to some recovery in growth.",

        "Committee members discussed the availability of credit in the economy and were updated about credit developments in recent months.",
        "Both bank and non-bank credit continued to increase over recent months, although at a slow pace relative to recent years, and particularly at a slow pace compared with GDP growth.",
        "In particular, there was a slowdown in credit extended to the real estate sector, in which increased risks led to tighter terms for granting credit to contractors.",
        "The tightening of the terms, at least at some banks, was unrelated to industry specific credit limitations on the construction industry that they face.",
        "Participants also discussed the difficulties in recycling debts on the capital market in light of the increase in corporate bond yields, primarily those of companies with medium to low credit ratings.",
        "These difficulties, seen in the survey of business trends as well, were mainly prevalent among real estate companies and small companies.",
        "Committee members also discussed the extent to which the recent months' increase in geopolitical risk in the region affected the underperformance of Israel's stock market relative to world stock markets, the depreciation of the shekel against the dollar, and the exit of capital from Israel.",
        "Apparently, the changes observed can be attributed partially to additional factors in place in Israel recently as well, such as the impact of the social protest, numerous debt restructurings, and increased capital gains tax.",
        "With that, it was noted that there have not been widening CDS spreads, nor declines in tourist entries or investment.",
        "The Committee was united in the opinion that the level of the interest rate appeared appropriate given the data that became available this month, both on inflation and on activity.",
        "This was in light of developments which indicated that while on the one hand, inflation expectations did increase—though they nonetheless remained within the inflation target range at the same time that actual inflation was entrenched in the target range; on the other hand, it appears that the pace of growth slowed and is consistent with the growth forecast for this year.",
        "Additionally, there was no improvement in risk assessments.",
        "Following the discussion, the six members of the Monetary Committee voted on the rate of interest for March 2012.",
        "All six members of the Committee voted in favor of keeping the interest rate at its current level.",
        "In announcing the decision, the Bank of Israel emphasized the following points that led to the decision to leave the interest rate unchanged at 2.5 percent for March 2012: - Inflation expectations from various sources, for the next twelve months and for longer terms, are within the inflation target range.",
        "However, in the past month they have increased by approximately 0.2 percentage points, to around 2.5 percent.",
        "Actual inflation over the previous twelve months continues to settle firmly within the inflation target range.",
        "- The indicators that became available this month support the assessment that in the fourth quarter and in January the slowdown in the rate of growth of activity continued.",
        "With that, some monthly indicators (such as the manufacturing production index, trade and services revenue index, and the index of imports of production inputs) point to slight improvement in recent months.",
        "Indicators of real economic activity are consistent with the Bank of Israel forecast of growth of about 2.8 percent in 2012.",
        "- Data on global economic activity which became available this month presented a mixed picture, and financial markets exhibited some increase in optimism.",
        "In the US, relatively encouraging data were published.",
        "In emerging economies, data were mixed; in Europe and Japan, macro figures continued to indicate a recessionary environment, which is expected to continue in the current quarter as well.",
        "About a month ago, the IMF revised downward its 2012 and 2013 global growth and world trade forecasts, with its economists emphasizing the developing recession in Europe.",
        "- Interest rates in major economies are low, and markets are not pricing in an increase in the interest rate this year by any of the central banks of large advanced economies.",
        "The Fed, it will be recalled, declared that the federal funds rate will remain at its near-zero level at least until the middle of 2014.",
        "The Bank of England and the ECB continued their efforts to increase liquidity.",
        "The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in Israel's economy and the global economy and in financial markets.",
        "The Bank will use the tools available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, including keeping a close watch on developments in the asset markets.",
        "Europe continues to be the major risk source, particularly financially, but also in real terms, in light of the disappointing macro data and the euro zone's switch to negative growth in the fourth quarter (-0.3 percent).",
        "Even though the financing costs of Portugal, Italy, Ireland, and Spain have decreased dramatically since the beginning of the year and have reduced the risk of contagion in Europe, the improvement is based particularly on the LTRO tender, and not on change in the debt/growth course in these economies.",
        "Meanwhile, the assistance program for Greece was approved by the troika of international entities (IMF, ECB, and EU) and the process with the PSI will probably be concluded in the coming week.",
        "According to the agreement, the haircut will stand at around 53 percent, in which the debt will be rolled over for 30 years in exchange for an average coupon of around 3.6 percent.",
        "Despite approval of the agreement, its full realization is dependent on ratification by the various European parliaments, and on severe restraining steps to be taken in Greece, including the dismissal of around 150,000 employees in the public sector by Furthermore, realization of the agreement depends also on the new government in Greece (elections in April) meeting its obligations, and on positive developments in the European and the Greek economy (growth and deficit), which are unlikely to occur at the rate required by the agreement.",
        "At the same time, the fiscal pact is gaining momentum.",
        "Additional criteria were determined during the European Union conference at the end of January; their approval in principle is expected to take place at the coming conference at the end of March, and they are expected to go into effect toward the end of 2013.",
        "On the real side, macro data continues to indicate a slowdown.",
        "Production and export figures, particularly in Germany and France, are very weak (industrial production in these economies decreased in December by around 2.9 and 1.4 percent, respectively); against this, confidence surveys continue to show improvement (IFO and ZEW).",
        "GDP figures for the fourth quarter were not as bad as projected: France surprised positively with growth of around 0.2 percent (the forecast was for a similar negative figure).",
        "Italy, however, surprised with a greater-than-expected negative growth (-0.7 percent).",
        "Macro data published this month continue to be encouraging and even strong, as opposed to the negative trend in Europe, and indicates a slight acceleration this month in the pace of activity.",
        "Employment data and vehicle sales surprised on the upside this month.",
        "The other major data, sales indices, the FED's manufacturing indices, and credit data were also better than expected.",
        "The labor market is surprisingly good: the number of employed persons increased this month by 243,000, as opposed to the expected increase of 140,000 (non-farm payroll), with the result that the unemployment rate fell to 8.3 percent.",
        "This positive trend, which has continued for several months, indicates a rise in the rate of activity and optimism in the business sector; this trend also emerges from the CEO Confidence Survey in the United States, which resumed its rise in recent months, and also in the continuing growth in inventories.",
        "It should, however, be noted that part of the decrease in the unemployment rate in recent months is a result of the continuing decrease in the participation rate, a particularly worrying trend in view of the fact that the rate of long-term unemployed The vehicle market continues to recover.",
        "The volume of sales increased in recent months from less than 12 million vehicles a year to the latest figure of more than 14 million.",
        "This growth indicates a spurt in business activity and in household demand, as emerges also from consumer credit data, which increased by around $20 billion this month (an annualized growth rate of around 3.7 percent), an encouraging growth rate historically as well.",
        "The Tech Pulse Index also started increasing again this month.",
        "The growth course, however, is expected to continue to undershoot the long-term trend, at least in the coming year, and even this trend is still subject to many shocks, both internal (political) and external (Europe and commodity prices).",
        "These risks are reflected in the downgraded IMF forecast for 2012 and 2013 of 1.8 percent and 2.2 percent, respectively.",
        "It should be emphasized that this forecast assumes that most of the assistance programs will continue.",
        "At its last meeting the Fed also remained pessimistic about the pace of the recovery, and downgraded its growth forecast for the next two years, while emphasizing the many growth risks, particularly regarding the employment market and domestic demand, which, despite improvement, are still at historically low levels, and are threatened by the recent rise in fuel prices.",
        "The state of the real estate market continues to be precarious.",
        "Admittedly, initial signs of recovery are evident in this sector in recent months, as emerges also from the Housing Market Index in the United States, which continued to rise for the fifth consecutive month.",
        "These signs, however, still cannot change the gloomy overall picture, particularly in light of the fact that the percentage of homes with negative equity stands at around 20 percent (about 12 million homes).",
        "Furthermore, one of the major challenges in the coming month is the issue of the assistance programs, which are meant to end on the 28th of the month.",
        "These programs were extended by two months, when it seemed that agreement had been achieved to extend them to the end of the year for most clauses.",
        "Macro data this month were mixed.",
        "Some point to a continuing slowdown in the rate of growth, while others point to slight recovery.",
        "The main scenario expects a smooth landing, but the weak data from China, especially in real estate, which continues to indicate a decline in prices, is worrying.",
        "Most data on the emerging economies still point to improvement, among other things, against the backdrop of progress in the debt crisis in Europe, while the sharp increase in capital movements since the beginning of the year has also reinforced the general optimistic feeling.",
        "Foreign capital flows into emerging economies gathered momentum this month as part of the worldwide risk-on trend.",
        "The continuing recovery combined with a decrease in European debt risk is expected to intensify this activity.",
        "The major threat to growth remains external (Europe and commodities).",
        "The recession in Europe combined with the worsening financial conditions has led to a slowdown in the rate of growth in recent months, and a downgrading of forecasts.",
        "Further deterioration in Europe, a major export target, is liable, again according to the IMF, to cut growth in China, which currently stands at 8.2 percent, by half.",
        "A further threat, as mentioned, is the continuing rise in commodity prices, particularly oil.",
        "The continuation of this trend is liable to moderate the rate of growth on the one hand, and intensify inflation on the other, and thereby restrain policy steps that are meant to support growth.",
        "The New Year that began last month in China makes it difficult to provide a clear assessment of the various developments; overall, however, a weak picture emerges relative to the previous month.",
        "Even though the (official) PMI data rose above 50, the section on export orders was very weak.",
        "Furthermore, import and export figures were negative for the first time in two years (exports fell by around 15 percent).",
        "Part of the decrease, however, can be explained by the new year events in January, which reduced activity in the factories.",
        "A further worrying sign is the continuing fall in real estate prices January as well in 48 of the 70 major cities in China.",
        "On the other hand, the leading index and industrial sector profits in December were surprisingly good.",
        "Against the backdrop of the weak data, the People's Bank of China decided to again lower the reserve requirement by 50 base points.",
        "This step is expected to also support an increase in overall credit, one of the government's objectives, but it ran into difficulties, as the previous data shows.",
        "Furthermore, the most recent inflation data was a surprisingly high 4.5 percent, which will probably prevent the PBC from reducing interest rates in the near future.",
        "The easing of the debt crisis in Europe, the continuing improvement in the United States, and particularly the LTRO tenders, continue to be the major factors supporting the positive sentiment in capital markets worldwide.",
        "Against this backdrop, the major indices continued their positive trend this month as well.",
        "Nevertheless, the trend moderated in the past few days because of weak macro data and fears of further slowdown in the growth rate of the emerging economies.",
        "Most of the increases focused on Europe, with a rise of about 7 percent in the DAX and about 4.5 percent in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.",
        "The high liquidity level in the markets is also a major factor.",
        "The further expansions declared by Japan and the UK will also provide additional support for rising values in the coming months.",
        "The global bond markets continue to be influenced mainly by developments around the debt crisis in Europe.",
        "A further sharp decrease was recorded this month in the bond yields of the problematic economies, a fall of around 100 basis points on average, for most time periods.",
        "A further indication of improvement in the markets is the activity in the new issue market, which has shown impressive improvement since the beginning of the year relative to the third and fourth quarters of 2011.",
        "New issues in Europe stand at close to $400 billion, as against about $275 billion in the fourth quarter; a similar trend is evident in the United States.",
        "Despite this, the risk of a sharp correction in the markets remains high, against the backdrop of the high volatility in the various investment channels, and the sensitivity to economic developments worldwide, particularly Europe.",
        "Inflation worldwide remained unchanged this month, with a slight decrease in some of the major economies (excluding China).",
        "Expectations are that inflation will remain restrained throughout the coming year.",
        "However, geopolitical developments in conjunction with weather related effects could reverse this trend, as seems to have been the case this month in the wake of developments in Iran and the very cold weather in Europe, which led to a further rise in oil prices from $110 a barrel to more than $122.",
        "Saudi Arabia has already announced that it will increase oil production in the event of a reduction in Iranian output as a result of a military confrontation and/or embargo, while at the same time the resumption of oil production in Libya is likely to help.",
        "Nevertheless, the continuing verbal violence between the parties is likely to lead to a further rise in oil prices.",
        "The Agricultural Commodities Index rose this month by about 2.2 percent, the Metals Index by about 1.7 percent, while the Energy Index rose by about 10 percent, mainly against the backdrop of the nearly 12 percent increase in the price of oil.",
        "Price volatility is still high, and the risk of a continuing rise in the coming months increased this month as a result of developments in the markets and in the Middle East.",
        "Most of the major currencies strengthened against the dollar at a rate of up to 7.1 percent, while the Chinese yuan weakened against the dollar by 4.1 percent.",
        "In the process of making the monthly interest rate decision by the Monetary Committee, discussions are held at two levels––the first in a broad forum, and the second in a narrower one.",
        "In the broad-forum discussion, the relevant background economic conditions are presented, including real, monetary and financial developments in Israel’s economy, and developments in the global economy.",
        "Participants in this discussion include the three members of the Monetary Committee from the Bank—the Governor, the Deputy Governor and the Senior Advisor to the Governor—and the three members of the Monetary Committee from the public.",
        "Other participants in the discussion are the Directors of the Research and Market Operations Departments, and economists from various departments who prepare and present the material for discussion.",
        "The data, estimates and assessments in this report are those that were available at the time of the discussions.",
        "In the narrow forum, which consists of the Monetary Committee and the Directors of the Research and Monetary Operations Departments, the two Departmental Directors present their recommendations regarding the interest rate.",
        "An open discussion follows, which ends with a vote on the level of the interest rate.",
        "According to the Bank of Israel Law, 5770-2010, (section 18(c)), the decision on the interest rate is reached by majority vote of the members of the Monetary Committee who participate in the voting.",
        "If the vote is tied, the chairperson (the Governor) has an additional vote.",
        "Indicators of real economic activity that became available this month raise concerns of a decline in the growth rate, which was already relatively moderate in recent months.",
        "These concerns are based on particularly weak export data for June.",
        "In contrast, the combined monthly indicators in the Composite State of the Economy Index, and expectations reported in surveys, indicate a growth rate which is similar to that of recent months.",
        "Manufacturing exports (excluding diamonds) declined in June by 13 percent compared with May and compared with the monthly average in January–May.",
        "Atypically, the decline in exports encompasses a large number of industries.",
        "While it is possible that this is an exceptional monthly figure which reflects unusual volatility, the possibility also exists that a decline in such a wide range of export industries is a result of a sharp decline in global demand.",
        "In contrast, the Composite State of the Economy Index, which increased by 0.2 percent in June, indicates that the economy continues to expand, with stabilization of the growth rate in the second quarter at a similar pace to that of the first quarter of the year.",
        "A similar picture arises from the Business Tendency Survey conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics, the Bank of Israel's index based on Google searches which serves as an indicator of demand in the economy, and the Purchasing Managers Index.",
        "Against this background, the Research Department's Nowcasting estimate for GDP growth in the second quarter, based on current economic data, is for 2.8 percent, a pace of growth which is similar to that of recent months.",
        "Labor market data which became available after the last monetary policy discussion raise the possibility that the improvement in this area has halted.",
        "The unemployment rate in May was 7.1 percent, compared with 6.8 percent in April; however, the increase in unemployment came alongside increases in the employment rate and in the rate of participation in the labor force.",
        "In January–April, there was a slowdown in the rate of growth of employee posts, reflecting a slowdown in a wide range of industries.",
        "At the same time, the ratio of job vacancies to total employee posts increased to 3.1 percent in June, compared with 2.7 percent in May, and data on the numbers of employed persons in April and May, based on the new Labour Force Survey, are slightly more positive—the number of employed persons increased by 0.4 percent in May, compared with April.",
        "Health tax receipts, which provide an indication of total wage payments, were 6.7 percent higher in June in nominal terms than in June 2011 percent higher than in May 2011.",
        "Nominal wages increased by 1 percent in February– April compared with the preceding three months, and real wages increased by 0.2 percent.",
        "Actual budget expenditure figures indicate a domestic deficit excluding net credit granted in the first half of the year of NIS 7.6 billion, compared with a deficit of NIS forecast, the deficit in 2012 is projected to be greater than the Ministry of Finance's revised deficit forecast of 3.4 percent of GDP—primarily due to lower than expected revenues for the first half of the year.",
        "After the publication of the previous interest rate decision, the government decided to increase the deficit target for 2013 to 3 percent of GDP, compared with its previous target of 1.5 percent of GDP.",
        "To date, decisions have not been reached regarding how the government intends to meet this target.",
        "Given the growth forecast, and assuming that steps required to maintain the expenditure rule will be taken, the deficit for 2013 is expected to be above 4 percent of GDP.",
        "In order to meet the deficit target, tax rates will have to be raised.",
        "The decision to increase the deficit target to 3 percent of GDP and the uncertainty of meeting the target raise the concern that the credibility of fiscal policy—which was a central component of the economy's success in dealing with the previous crisis—will erode.",
        "The Consumer Price Index (CPI) declined by 0.3 percent in June, below forecasts which ranged from a decline of 0.1 percent to an increase of 0.3 percent, and below the seasonal path consistent with achieving the inflation target.",
        "The main factors which stood out this month were the declines in the transport and communication component and in energy prices, and the more moderate than expected increase in the housing component and in seasonal components—clothing and footwear and fruit and vegetables.",
        "The rate of inflation over the previous twelve months declined this month to 1 percent, the lower bound of the inflation target range (of 1–3 percent), compared with 1.6 percent in the previous month.",
        "Forecasts of the inflation rate over the next twelve months based on the average of forecasters' inflation predictions, on expectations calculated from the capital markets futures contracts offered by banks, continued to decline this month as well, and range from 1.6 percent to 2 percent, compared with 1.8–2.2 percent the previous month.",
        "Inflation expectations for two years and longer range between 2.3 percent and 2.4 percent, compared with a range of 2.4–2.5 percent in the previous quarter.",
        "Expectations for the Bank of Israel interest rate in one year from now, derived from the Telbor (Tel Aviv Inter-Bank Offered Rate) market, calculated from the _makam_ yield curve, and based on the average projection of forecasters, range between 2.1–2.2 percent.",
        "Most forecasters predict that the Bank of Israel interest rate for August will be unchanged, and that the interest rate will be reduced by 0.25 percentage points in the next three months.",
        "The housing component of the CPI (representing rents) increased in June by 0.1 percent.",
        "In the twelve months ending in June it increased by 3.4 percent, compared with an increase of 3.8 percent in the twelve months to May.",
        "Home prices, which are published in the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of home prices but are not included in the CPI, increased in April–May by 0.7 percent, after increasing by 1.3 percent in March–April.",

        "Committee members assess that the source of most of the increase in expectations is the increase in prices of fuel and energy world wide.",
        "In addition, Committee members considered the fact that the steep increase in inflation expectations derived from the capital markets (an increase of 0.3 percentage points from the previous month) derives partly from an upward bias in the estimation, and that it is likely that actual rates are lower than those estimated from the capital markets.",

        "Participants agreed that most indicators that became available this month support the assessment of recent months, according to which the rate of growth of the economy remains moderate, and similar to that of the final quarter of 2011; this through an increase in services exports and goods imports.",
        "Committee members noted that in light of new data concern of a further decline in the rate of GDP growth has eased.",
        "In addition, most leading indicators of economic growth, including the Google index and the Purchasing Managers Index, as well as those derived from the Bank of Israel Companies Survey and the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of business trends, indicate stabilization and even the potential for some acceleration in economic activity in the coming months.",
        "These indicators are consistent with the new forecast of the Bank of Israel.",
        "Within the framework of the narrow forum, home prices were also discussed.",
        "It was emphasized that despite the fact that home prices increased in December–January by cumulative decline was 1.4 percent, the rate of growth of home prices over the previous twelve months moderated to 4.5 percent.",
        "The moderation in the growth rate of home prices in recent months comes against the background of continued growth in the number of building starts, the lagged effect of the increase in the interest rate, measures introduced by the Bank of Israel affecting mortgages, and steps taken by the Ministry of Finance in real estate taxation.",
        "These moves, together with land marketing efforts by the Ministry of Construction and Housing and the Israel Land Administration, are expected to continue to have an effect in the future.",
        "Nonetheless, with regard to home prices, the possibility of additional macroprudential measures was considered.",
        "It should be noted that within the framework of the narrow forum discussion in March, Committee members were updated by the Supervisor of Banks regarding the availability of credit in the economy, and its development in recent months.",
        "In a review presented to the members of the narrow forum, the Supervisor discussed the new core capital requirements and their expected effect on banking system activity as well as on the granting of credit in the economy.",
        "It was noted, among other things, that there is potential for increasing credit in the economy, and that according to the Companies Survey, there is an indication that at present the availability of credit is low, primarily for small businesses and in the construction and real estate sector.",
        "For small businesses, both the Ministry of Finance as well as banks have initiatives which are intended to increase the availability of credit to that sector.",
        "With regard to the construction and real estate sector, increased risk led to tighter terms for granting credit.",
        "According to the Supervisor, in at least some of the banks this tightening is related to the proximity to the effective industry limitation in granting credit to the real estate sector.",
        "An additional issue discussed was the level of global economic activity.",
        "The Committee was united in its view that the risks to Israel's economy observed in the slowdown, primarily those related to the debt crisis in Europe, and their potential effects on its functioning, have lessened to date.",
        "It appears that the eurozone is not facing collapse but rather a lengthy recession and that the treaty for tightening fiscal discipline is expected to make the switch to future growth in Europe more difficult.",
        "In contrast, it was noted that macro figures in the US continued to surprise on the upside, and appear even better compared with the eurozone economy.",
        "This is as data on employment, consumer confidence, retail sales, and manufacturing in the US indicate expansion.",
        "Although the recovery in activity is not accompanied by notable recovery in the housing market, it appears that this issue has become more a regional one than a countrywide one.",
        "In contrast with developments in the US economy, which are expected to impact positively on the global economy, in the opinion of the Committee members there is a question mark regarding the level of economic activity in emerging markets.",
        "Macroeconomic data in emerging markets are mixed, but continue to indicate a slowdown in their growth, with India and Brazil each reporting that their growth rate in the fourth quarter of 2011 was the lowest in two years, and China reduced its growth forecasts to 7.5 percent.",
        "This implies that close monitoring of developments in those economies is required.",
        "In addition, participants stressed that interest rates in major economies remain low, and markets are not pricing in an increase in the interest rate this year by any of the central banks of large advanced economies.",
        "In light of the range of factors, the Monetary Committee decided to leave the interest rate for April 2012 unchanged at 2.5 percent.",
        "In announcing the decision, the Bank of Israel emphasized the following points that led to the decision to leave the interest rate unchanged: - The CPI was unchanged in February.",
        "Inflation over the previous 12 months continues to settle firmly within the inflation target range, and is currently at 1.7 percent.",
        "Inflation expectations from various sources (forecasters, the Bank of Israel, CPI futures) for the next twelve months are within the inflation target range.",
        "However, in the past two months they have increased, and are currently in a range of 2.4–2.6 percent, mainly due to the increase in energy prices world wide, and the possibility of additional increases in coming months.",
        "- The indicators that became available this month indicate a stable rate of increase of activity at the levels recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011.",
        "Estimated expectations of economy activity have improved, and they indicate some improvement in the rate of growth.",
        "Against this background, the Research Department updated its forecasts for growth in 2012 to 3.1 percent, compared with its forecast published 3 months ago which projected 2.8 percent.",
        "The forecast for - Developments in the global economy and international capital markets this month reduced the probability of significant deterioration in economic activity in Europe and the US in the near future.",
        "Most US macroeconomic data surprised on the upside, and the US economy grew by 3 percent in the fourth quarter.",
        "In contrast, in the eurozone there was contraction of 0.3 percent.",
        "Macro data in emerging countries were mixed, but continue to indicate a moderate slowdown in their growth.",
        "- Interest rates in major economies remained low, and markets are not pricing in an increase in the interest rate this year by any of the central banks of large advanced economies.",
        "The Fed and ECB maintained their interest rates unchanged this month as expected.",
        "The Fed declared that it intends to maintain the federal funds rate at its near-zero level at least until the end of 2014.",
        "The ECB launched an additional monetary expansion program which includes injecting significant liquidity into eurozone banks.",
        "The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in Israel's economy and the global economy and in financial markets.",
        "The Bank will use the tools available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, including keeping a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housing market.",
        "Macro data published this month in Europe continue to point to contraction: the various PMI indices (which are already below 50) fell this month, retail sales did not increase, and industrial production fell by 1.2 percent.",
        "The eurozone economy contracted in the fourth quarter of 2011 by 0.3 percent, and the ECB downgraded its growth forecast for 2012 from 0.3 percent to –0.1 percent; the average forecast of the investment houses is even lower, with a contraction of 0.5 percent.",
        "Despite having lowered the forecasts, the ECB kept interest at 1 percent, and stated that inflation is likely to remain higher than 2 percent during 2012 because of the rise in energy prices.",
        "Inflation expectations inherent in the market also rose sharply as reflected in Germany's breakeven for two and five years, which recorded a sharp rise in the review period of 55 and 20 basis points, respectively.",
        "Despite this, inflation levels are still low, only 1.6 and 1.55 percent.",
        "The support of EU leaders (except for the United Kingdom and the Czech Republic) for a fiscal pact is also expected to weigh heavily on European economies that already suffer from negative growth and rising unemployment rates.",
        "The eurozone unemployment rate reached a record 10.7 percent this month.",
        "The UK, which is outside the eurozone, also contracted in the fourth quarter of 2012 by 0.2 percent, and its unemployment rate jumped to 8.4 percent, the highest since AAA, among other things, thanks to its economic and financial flexibility arising from its monetary independence, but added a negative forecast to the rating against the backdrop of the limited fiscal space to absorb future economic shocks, the high debt levels, the forecast of a weak economic recovery, and the fact that the UK's deficit is second is second only to the United States among countries with a perfect credit rating (from Fitch's perspective).",
        "Macro data in the United States continue to be encouraging, the most salient being the rate of growth and the unemployment.",
        "The growth rate in the fourth quarter rose to 3 percent, the sharpest rise since the second quarter of 2010, in light of the positive update of private consumption.",
        "The number of employees joining the labor market each month (non-farm payrolls) averaged more than 200 thousand in the past six months, the most significant rise since 2006.",
        "Even though the unemployment rate has remained at 8.3 percent, the positive reason for this rate not having fallen is that for the first time in a long time the rate of participation increased (from 63.7 percent to improving situation.",
        "Most of the other macro data published during the review period raise hopes that the US economy is moving toward improvement in business activity: the Consumer Confidence Index and the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index are the highest they have been for the past year, consumer credit in the past three months is at its highest level since August 2007, retail sales grew at their highest rate in the past five months, exports and imports are at historically record levels, and growth was recorded also in private consumption.",
        "Against this, it should be mentioned that a decrease was recorded in orders for durable goods and orders from factories, and production costs rose more than expected.",
        "The housing market is not recovering as much as was hoped, among other things, because as opposed to previous crises in which the interest on mortgages fell substantially, in the current crisis the rate fell relatively moderately, which attests to the fact that, similar to Europe, liquidity reaches the banks but does not sufficiently trickle down to households.",
        "In his half-yearly speech to Congress, and in the announcement accompanying the decision on the interest rate, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve mentioned that the unemployment level has remained high despite its recent substantial decrease, that inflation is still moderate, that interest will remain at zero level until 2014, and that the quantitative expansionary steps match the state of the economy.",
        "In light of Bernanke's comments, the market does not expect a further quantitative expansion at this stage, and is even more optimistic about an interest rate increase that is already being priced for August 2013.",
        "The major risk for the US economy seems to be the rising price of oil, and the fear that military or economic pressure on Iran could lead to a further price surge that would erode real consumption and cool the positive momentum that Americans are currently experiencing.",
        "The IMF has warned that any setback to Middle Eastern oil supplies could raise the price of crude oil by up to 30 percent.",
        "The price of a barrel of oil, which has risen by around 12 percent since the beginning of February, has led to a significant increase in fuel prices at the pump and to inflation expectations, particularly in the short term, in which the breakeven for two, five and ten years has, since the beginning of the year, recorded a rise of 85, 60, and 50 basis points to a level of 2.2 percent, 2.15 percent and 2.4 percent, respectively (even though it remained unchanged during the review period), and market expectations of a first interest rate increase have already been brought forward to August 2013.",
        "In China, macro data published this month continue to indicate a slowdown in growth, despite the double-digit growth rate of the core indices.",
        "This month China reported its largest trade deficit in the past 22 years in light of the effect of the crisis in Europe, China's major export destination, which led to an annual increase in exports of only American exports).",

        "In addition, vehicle sales fell since the beginning of the year by 3 percent, the sharpest decrease since 2005, and housing prices continue to fall.",
        "A significant expression of the fall in demand is reflected this month in the CPI which surprisingly fell sharply from an annualized 4.5 percent last month to only 3.2 percent, the lowest level for 20 months, and below the inflation target of 4 percent.",
        "The growth slowdown and the sharp fall in the inflation rate could indicate that the People's Bank of China will adopt a more expansionary monetary approach in the future.",
        "The Chinese government announced a decrease in the growth target, which has stood at 8 percent since 2005, to only 7.5 percent, and that it views as a strategic objective the narrowing of social gaps, progress in the direction of domestic consumption-based growth, and tightening the supervision of real estate (bubble) and the local authorities exports (a step that could assist the exports of its competitors in general, and the United States in particular) in favor of encouraging private consumption.",
        "Forecasts for China are still speaking of a soft landing only, with growth directed toward private consumption, a decrease in exports, and a continuing growth in imports, which could also support the global economy.",
        "India is also experiencing slowdown, as evident in the publication of the growth figure for the fourth quarter, which was only 6.1 percent, the slowest growth rate in the past two years, against the backdrop of the global crisis and the decrease in domestic demand.",
        "A further reason for the slowdown is the rise in interest at the end of 2011 to 8.5 percent (the highest level since 2008), the purpose of which was to curb inflation which hovered around 9 percent during the year.",
        "Since then inflation has fallen sharply to only 5.5 percent in January, but, as mentioned, at the price of economic slowdown.",
        "Interest remained unchanged this month at 8.5 percent, but announcements suggest that interest will be lowered soon.",
        "Brazil recorded in the fourth quarter an annual growth of only 1.4 percent, as against weakness of the economy is explained, among other things, by the strength of the currency in historical terms, a fact that has returned Brazil to the \"currency war\" by means of several steps designed to weaken the currency.",

        "In the process of making the monthly interest rate decision by the Monetary Committee, discussions are held at two levels––the first in a broad forum, and the second in a narrower one.",
        "In the broad-forum discussion, the relevant background economic conditions are presented, including real, monetary and financial developments in Israel’s economy, and developments in the global economy.",
        "Participants in this discussion include the three members of the Monetary Committee from the Bank—the Governor, the Deputy Governor and the Senior Advisor to the Governor—and the three members of the Monetary Committee from the public.",

        "Indicators of real economic activity that became available this month are consistent with the growth forecast published last month by the Bank of Israel, according to which growth in 2012 will be 3.1 percent, and surveys indicate that concern of a further decline in the rate of GDP growth has eased.",

        "The deviation from the path derives primarily from lower than expected tax receipts in February and March.",
        "Likewise, the government's commitments for this year (wage agreements, defense expenditure, etc.)",
        "are about NIS 6 billion above the budget's expenditure ceiling.",
        "It should be noted, however, that the government has not in the past deviated from the expenditure ceiling, and that the risk of a further increase in the budget deficit from a breach in the budget expenditure framework is much smaller than that arising from a potential decline in government receipts.",

        "Although in February the number of homes available for sale built by the private sector declined by 3 percent, the decline came after a marked increase in the number of homes available for sale since the second quarter of 2011, the result of a sharp increase in building starts since the end of 2009.",
        "Thus, the number of homes for sale is still at the levels of 2003–07.",
        "The moderation in the rate of increase in home prices in recent months comes against the background of the continued increase in the number of building starts, the lagged effect of the changes in the interest rate, measures introduced by the Bank of Israel affecting mortgages, and steps taken by the Ministry of Finance in real estate taxation.",

        "The participants discussed several issues, primarily: developments in inflation and inflation expectations, the assessment of real economic activity, including the housing market; fiscal policy and the budget deficit; global developments, and the risks to the Israeli economy deriving from those developments.",
        "Committee members referred to the CPI data for March, which increased above the average forecast, while the CPI over the past twelve months remained below the midpoint of the inflation target range.",
        "Relatively little weight was given in the discussion to the high CPI reading for March, since it was reasoned that, among other things, the seasonally high figure for April was partially brought forward into March due to the relatively early occurrence of the Passover holiday this year.",
        "Likewise, it was noted that energy and housing prices which raised the index for March continue to be the dominant factor in the twelve-month increase in the index.",
        "In recent months, there have been near zero rates of changes in the rolling twelve-month index excluding housing and energy.",
        "In other words, excluding housing and energy prices, there do not appear to be other inflationary demand pressures.",
        "Looking forward, to the extent that the declines in global oil prices and prices of agricultural commodities and metals which occurred this month take hold, they are likely to moderate both actual inflation and inflation expectations.",
        "Regarding real economic activity, Committee members referred to new data published in the past month.",
        "In their assessment, the picture which emerges from the range of figures is mixed, and along with positive indicators, primarily from company surveys regarding expectations of future activity, there have also been several negative figures published.",
        "With that, Committee members still assess that the data which became available are consistent with the recent 3.1 percent growth forecast for 2012 published by the Bank of Israel.",
        "The forum also dealt with Labour Force Survey data, which are now based on a new methodology, and indicate an unemployment rate of 6.5 percent in February—a slight decline from January and from the first quarter of 2011—as well as a decline in the participation rate and in the employment rate.",
        "Committee members emphasized that the findings and new methodology of the survey need to be studied, and that its reliability has not yet been established.",
        "Regarding the housing market, Committee members noted that looking over the past twelve months, there has been some moderation in the increase in the housing component of the CPI (based on rents) and in home prices (based on the CBS survey), and the increase in the latter has even halted.",
        "With that, in recent months there has been a recovery in the volume of new mortgages granted and in the number of transactions in the housing market.",
        "The Committee is following developments in the housing market, and will continue to monitor the market and will consider taking steps if necessary.",
        "The forum also discussed fiscal policy and the budget deficit.",
        "The members of the Committee spoke of the importance of maintaining fiscal discipline and continuing with the process of reducing the debt/GDP ratio.",
        "They noted that at this time developments in fiscal policy and the deficit are having no evident effect on inflation.",
        "Another issue discussed was the global environment and the risks posed by it to the Israeli economy.",
        "Committee members referred to concerns which continued to be raised in regard to the debt crisis in Europe, particularly in Spain, the loss of momentum in the US and the mixed data regarding emerging economies, after a period of relative calm and expectations for recovery.",
        "Committee members noted that if the new developments persist, it will make exports, and thus economic growth, more difficult.",
        "Forum members noted that it is still too early to determine whether there is a change in the trend.",
        "In light of the range of factors, the Monetary Committee decided unanimously to keep the interest rate for May unchanged at 2.5 percent.",
        "In announcing the decision, the Bank of Israel said that leaving the interest rate for May unchanged at 2.5 percent is consistent with interest rate policy that is intended to entrench the inflation rate within the price stability range of 1–3 percent a year over the next twelve months, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability.",
        "The path of the interest rate in the future depends on developments in the inflation environment, growth in Israel, the global economy, monetary policies of major central banks, and developments in the exchange rate of the shekel.",
        "In its announcement, the Bank highlighted the following main considerations underlying the decision: - The CPI increased by 0.4 percent in March, at the upper bound of the range of forecasts.",
        "For the third consecutive month, inflation over the previous twelve months is near the midpoint of the target inflation range, and in March was 1.9 percent.",
        "The housing and energy components of the CPI continued to contribute significantly to inflation.",
        "Inflation expectations for the coming year are around 2.5 percent.",
        "The relatively high figure derives primarily from the continuing increase in energy prices despite some decline in recent weeks, and from expectations that the housing (rent) component in the CPI will continue to increase at a relatively high rate.",
        "There do not appear to be other domestic inflationary demand pressures.",
        "Expectations for the Bank of Israel interest rate in the coming months are stable.",
        "- Indicators of real economic activity that became available this month are consistent with the growth forecast published last month by the Bank of Israel, according to which growth in 2012 will be 3.1 percent.",
        "Based on various surveys, companies' expectations for future activity are slightly more positive than in previous surveys.",
        "- After a period of relative calm over the debt crisis in Europe, concerns of a renewed worsening increased this month.",
        "Global macro figures continued this month to indicate a slower rate of recovery in the global economy, with some slowing in growth in the US and China.",
        "With that, this month the IMF revised upward its global growth and world trade forecasts slightly, while emphasizing the risks to the recovery process.",
        "- Interest rates in major economies remain low, and markets are not pricing in an increase in the interest rate this year by any of the central banks of large advanced economies.",
        "The Fed has declared previously that it intends to maintain the federal funds rate at its near-zero level at least until the end of 2014.",
        "The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in Israel's economy and the global economy and in financial markets.",
        "The Bank will use the tools available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, including keeping a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the asset markets.",
        "In the process of making the monthly interest rate decision by the Monetary Committee, discussions are held at two levels––the first in a broad forum, and the second in a narrower one.",
        "In the broad-forum discussion, the relevant background economic conditions are presented, including real, monetary and financial developments in Israel’s economy, and developments in the global economy.",
        "Participants in this discussion include the three members of the Monetary Committee from the Bank—the Governor, the Deputy Governor and the Senior Advisor to the Governor—and the three members of the Monetary Committee from the public.",
        "Other participants in the discussion are the Directors of the Research and Market Operations Departments, and economists from various departments who prepare and present the material for discussion.",
        "The data, estimates and assessments in this report are those that were available at the time of the discussions.",
        "In the narrow forum, which consists of the Monetary Committee and the Directors of the Research and Monetary Operations Departments, the two Departmental Directors present their recommendations regarding the interest rate.",
        "An open discussion follows, which ends with a vote on the level of the interest rate.",
        "According to the Bank of Israel Law, 5770-2010, (section 18(c)), the decision on the interest rate is reached by majority vote of the members of the Monetary Committee who participate in the voting.",
        "If the vote is tied, the chairperson (the Governor) has an additional vote.",
        "Indicators of real economic activity that became available this month support the assessment that the economy is growing at a rate similar to that of recent quarters, a rate which is in line with the Bank of Israel's growth forecast for 2012, of 3.1 percent.",
        "According to a preliminary estimate of National Accounts figures for the second quarter of the year (annualized, seasonally adjusted), GDP increased by 3.2 percent, compared with 2.8 percent in the previous quarter; business sector product increased by 3.7 percent, compared with 2.2 percent in the previous quarter; private consumption increased 5.4 percent, compared with 6.2 percent in the previous quarter; fixed capital formation declined by 1.1 percent, compared with an increase of 3 percent in the previous quarter; and exports (excluding diamonds) increased 9.8 percent, compared with 4.9 percent in the previous quarter.",
        "The Composite State of the Economy Index for July increased by 0.2 percent, though the forecast of real activity as reflected in various surveys is for a slowdown in activity in the economy.",
        "Second quarter data from the Labour Force Survey, in its new format, indicate continued growth in employment and an unusual increase in the participation rate (0.8 percentage points), which was reflected in an increase in the employment rate (59.1 percent in the second quarter compared with 58.5 percent in the previous quarter), and an increase in the unemployment rate for the second quarter to 7 percent.",
        "At the same time, there was an increase in the rate of workers employed full time.",
        "In contrast, survey figures for the month of June indicate a slight decline in the employment rate compared with May, and National Insurance data show that in July, there was an increase of more than 10 percent in the number of new claims for unemployment benefits (seasonally adjusted), compared with the previous month.",

        "Nominal wages of Israelis increased by 1 percent in March–May, seasonally adjusted, compared with the preceding three months, and real wages increased by 0.3 percent.",
        "Health tax receipts, which provide an indication of total wage payments, were 6 percent higher in July in nominal terms than in July 2011 (excluding the effect of legislative changes), a rate of change similar to that in previous months.",
        "Actual budget expenditure figures indicate a domestic deficit, excluding net credit granted in the year to date through July, of NIS 9.3 billion, compared with a deficit of NIS 3.6 billion in the corresponding period of 2011.",
        "The deficit in 2012 is projected to be between 3.5–4 percent of GDP, primarily due to lower than expected revenues for the first half of the year.",
        "In order to reduce the expected deficit in 2012 and to meet the deficit target for 2013 set by the government, 3 percent of GDP, the government and Knesset decided this month on several steps to increase tax rates, some already taking effect in 2012 and the remainder beginning in January 2013.",
        "Decisions on government expenditure in the coming year have not yet been reached; specifically, whether a budget for 2013, which will require significant cuts in accordance with the \"automatic pilot\" in order to remain within the expenditure rule, will be passed soon, or if instead -- if the Knesset does not approve a budget for 2013 before the start of next year -- a transition budget which allows monthly expenditure of 1/12 of the 2012 budget, which would reflect considerable restraint, will be managed.",
        "The Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 0.1 percent in July, in line with forecasts, and below the seasonal path consistent with achieving the inflation target.",
        "The main factors which stood out this month were the increase in the housing index and the decline in the food and energy components.",
        "The rate of inflation over the previous twelve months was 1.4 percent, compared with 1 percent the previous month.",
        "On a seasonally adjusted basis, inflation since the beginning of the year has been 0.9 percent in annual terms.",
        "Forecasts of the inflation rate over the next twelve months based on the average of forecasters' inflation predictions, on expectations calculated from the capital markets futures contracts offered by banks, increased this month, and range from 2.3 percent to 2.6 percent, compared with 1.6–2 percent in the previous month.",
        "The increase this month came after several months of decline in inflation expectations, and apparently derives from planned increases in indirect taxes, increased global commodity prices which are expected to have an effect on local prices as well, and from the depreciation of the shekel.",
        "According to forecasters, prices are expected to increase by 1.3 percent over the next three months.",

        "According to a Ministry of Finance publication, preliminary figures for July indicate an unusual increase in the number of home purchases.",
        "With that, it is likely that this increase derives from, among other things, purchases brought forward due to expectations for an increase in VAT.",
        "Yields on unindexed government bonds followed the global trend with an increase of up to 40 basis points, primarily in short to medium term maturities, as investors shifted funds during the month toward the indexed segment due to an increase in inflation expectations.",

        "In the discussion, three of them recommended reducing the interest rate by half a percentage point (with effect from 12 October) to 3.75 percent, one member of management recommended not to reduce the rate at this time, and one member recommended cutting the rate by one percentage point.",
        "The member of management recommending not to reduce the interest rate argued that although the events in the financial markets in the last few days did increase the probability of a slowdown and an easing of inflationary pressures, the developments could be reviewed at the next regular scheduled date for the decision and the appropriate steps taken then.",
        "Bringing forward the decision to reduce the interest rate by a few weeks would not have a significant effect on activity.",
        "The member of management recommending a one-percentage-point reduction in the interest rate put forward the view that the main purpose of the decision was to support financial stability, and it was best to send a very clear message that the Bank of Israel would do everything necessary in that area.",
        "The three members of management recommending a reduction of half a percentage point noted that inflationary pressures in Israel were expected to ease significantly, against the background of the continued fall in world commodity prices and the expected slowdown in growth.",
        "Inflation expectations and inflation predictions of the Israeli forecasters are currently within the target range.",
        "It was pointed out in the discussion that the current situation in the global economy, since the deterioration of the financial crisis, has increased the probability of a slowdown in growth in the near future.",
        "A reduction in the interest rate would help the economy meet the challenges it is facing.",
        "It was also stated that reducing the interest rate at this point would serve to enhance the functioning of the financial markets, and was of special importance at this point in time in light of the latest developments and the sharp rise in volatility in the financial markets around the world and in Israel.",
        "The world’s major central banks were expected to reduce their interest rates in the next few months.",
        "Taking all the above into consideration, the Governor decided to reduce the interest rate by half a percentage point to 3.75 percent with effect from 12 October.",
        "The Bank of Israel emphasizes that this decision to cut the rate of interest is consistent with the Bank’s aims to support economic growth and financial stability, as long as inflation is expected to converge to the price stability range.",

        "Another reduction at this time was not recommended, particularly in light of the relatively rapid weakening of the shekel against the dollar in the last few weeks.",
        "The two participants who recommended reducing the interest rate for November by 25 basis points stressed the following: inflation in Israel was expected to fall and return to within the target range around the middle of 2009; the slowdown in growth in Israel; and the high level of financial uncertainty at this time.",
        "They stated that expected interest rate reductions around the world in the near future were a major factor that enabled the Bank of Israel to cut its rate now.",
        "They argued for a 25-basispoint reduction in the rate, and not more, because they were of the opinion that it should be considered in conjunction with the half percentage point reduction decided upon by the Governor in the unscheduled interest rate discussion on 7 October.",
        "With regard to the depreciation of the shekel against the dollar in the last few weeks, this was expected to have some effect on inflation, but it should be borne in mind that the shekel had appreciated against the euro––in other words, the weakening of the shekel against the dollar reflected the general worldwide strengthening of the dollar.",
        "They added that the passthrough mechanism from changes in the exchange rate to inflation was expected to weaken as a result of the high volatility of the shekel exchange rate and the slower growth of demand in the economy.",
        "The two participants who recommended reducing the interest rate relatively steeply, by half a percentage point, emphasized that a major consideration leading to their recommendation was the fact that the situation in the financial markets around the world had continued to deteriorate in the days prior to the current discussions, and the lack of stability increased the concern over a global recession.",
        "They argued that looking to the future the risk of inflation in Israel had fallen considerably.",
        "They emphasized that the worldwide easing of inflationary pressures, the global economic slowdown and the global financial crisis had led to expectations that the main central banks would continue to reduce their interest rates in the next few months, which supports a substantial interest rate reduction in Israel too, and in their opinion enables the rate for November to be cut by half a percentage point.",
        "Given the assessments that a reduction in the interest rate was consistent with the return of inflation to the target range around the middle of 2009, and to strengthening the economy’s ability to deal with the implications of the global financial crisis and provide support for real activity, and following the unscheduled cut of half a percentage point in the interest rate on 7 October, the Governor decided to reduce the interest rate for November by 25 basis points, to 3.5 percent.",
        "The Bank stresses the following points supporting the decision: - The Bank’s assessment is that inflation, measured over the previous twelve months, will return to within the range in mid-2009.",
        "- The reduction in the interest rate is intended to lower the cost of credit, in light of the heightened uncertainty prevailing in the world’s financial markets, which also affects Israel’s economy.",
        "- The reduction in the interest rate is intended to provide support for economic activity, against the background of the slowdown in growth in Israel deriving from the global slowdown.",

        "In its meeting on 2 October, the ECB noted that inflation risks had declined, mainly due to the effect of the credit squeeze on growth, but it held the interest rate unchanged.",
        "However, on 8 October, it cut its interest rate by half a percentage point to Growth in Japan slowed, and the Japanese economy has entered a recession, against the background of the rises in commodity and energy prices in the first half of 2008 and the slowdown in exports, as well as the cutback in private consumption.",
        "The Japanese economy contracted by 3 percent in 2008:Q2, and the economic data published, including manufacturing production, factory orders and household expenditure all indicate weakness in the next quarters.",

        "According to this scenario, the interest rate declines to 3.4 percent in the last quarter of 2009, and inflation in that year comes to 1.5 percent.",

        "- Although a significant part of inflation is attributable to the direct effect on prices in Israel of the increase in world prices (particularly of food and energy), the increase in the interest rate has an important role to play in preventing a further spillover of the prices of imported goods to domestic goods.",

        "The figures of manufacturing output, retail sales, and orders for machinery also indicate faster growth than had been expected.",
        "On the other hand, indices of consumer confidence continue to reach new troughs; the number of building starts and house prices are still falling, extending the trend that has persisted during the last year-and-a-half; the surplus on the current account is declining very quickly due to the high energy prices; and company profits have slumped faster than any time since 2001.",
        "All these have led to expectations of significant weakness in the economy as early as in the next few months.",

        "This, together with the upward revision of the indices for the previous two months––that for February from 0.4 percent to 0.8 percent, and for March, from 0.5 percent to 0.6 percent––indicates the continued expansion of economic activity.",

        "The surprise in the last two indices compared with the forecasts was essentially due to the rise in the housing component, which rose by 1.1 percent in April, and which reflects the weakening of the link between the housing index and changes in the NIS/$ exchange rate.",
        "Other components of the index that increased were food, and transport and communications––against the background of the rises in world prices of food and energy––and clothing and footwear, education, and culture and entertainment.",

        "According to another quarterly model, in a scenario in which the average exchange rate in the last quarter of 2008 is about NIS 3.39 to the dollar, and the Bank of Israel interest rate rises from an average level of 3.3 percent in the second quarter of 2008 to an average level of 3.7 percent in the last quarter, inflation will reach 4.5 percent in the second quarter of 2009, inflation in 2009 will be 1.5 percent.",

        "Israel’s risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, continued to decline in May, falling from 60 basis points prior to the previous interest rate decision to 52 basis points on 26 May.",
        "CDS spreads for most emerging economies declined at similar rates.",
        "The world’s financial markets were somewhat calmer, but it is too soon to assess how long the pressures in the financial sector will persist.",
        "The latest economic data indicate that global growth and growth in the US have slowed.",
        "Concurrently, global inflation has accelerated, due mainly to the steep rises in commodity and fuel prices.",
        "This background leads to growing uncertainty regarding the expected path of interest rates in the major markets.",
        "A slowdown in growth increases the probability of expansionary monetary policies.",
        "On the other hand, inflationary pressures increase the likelihood of contractionary monetary policies.",
        "Prices of forward contracts imply expectations that the Fed will leave the interest rate unchanged at its next meeting (with a probability of 90 percent), and that the ECB and the Bank of Japan will raise their interest rates by 25 basis points by the end of the year (with high probability).",
        "The participants in the discussion focused on the 1.5 percent rise in the April CPI, which was about half a percentage point higher than expected.",
        "Unlike previous indices that were affected mainly by world energy and food prices, this time the index reflected also rises in domestic prices.",
        "Thus, the point was made that in the last twelve months the index excluding energy and food prices rose by 2.9 percent, close to the upper limit of the inflation target range, and higher than its rise of between 1.4 percent and 1.8 percent in the last few months.",
        "It was also noted that the fall in the value of the dollar is not evident in prices, because of the weakened pass-through between them, and because of domestic demand pressures.",
        "A variety of factors likely to influence future inflation were discussed: a possible halt in the rise of commodity prices, as per the latest IMF assessment; the possibility that oil prices will cease to rise or will even decline; and seasonal drops in the CPI later in the year following a relatively high inflation rate expected to be announced for May,.",
        "Another point raised related to inflation expectations one year forward.",
        "The two high CPIs for March and April, particularly the latter, resulted in private forecasters raising their predictions to above the upper limit of the target inflation range.",
        "In the course of the discussion the National Accounts data for the first quarter of assessments that the growth in real activity would start to slow.",
        "The point was made that the figures relate to the first quarter, whereas a slowdown in growth is expected later in the year.",
        "It was also noted that excluding taxes on imported durables (that showed an exceptional rise), GDP rose in the first quarter at a more modest rate of 4.2 percent.",
        "Export data were also analyzed: these rose faster than expected, despite the strengthening of the shekel.",
        "The conclusion drawn was that there is no evidence to date that the slowdown in the US is having an impact on Israel’s economy.",
        "The explanation may be that despite the slowdown in the US rate of growth, high-tech US imports continue to expand at a relatively constant rate, and this has affected Israel’s economy as most of Israel’s exports to the US are in this category.",
        "One member of the executive recommended that the Governor raise the interest rate by 0.5 percentage points.",
        "This member was of the opinion that the expected acceleration in inflation would be reflected in a persistent deviation from the price stability target, in light of the following factors: the exceptional rise in the CPI in April, which was the highest rise in the April index in the last five years; the adjusted indices also showed exceptional rises, the highest in April in the last four years; the rise in the CPI since the beginning of 2008 is consistent with an annual increase of 4 percent; inflation expectations calculated from the capital market have risen, and are close to the upper limit of the target range, and expectations twelve months forward reported in the Companies Survey and predicted by Israeli forecasters are above the upper limit of the range.",
        "The same member added that although much of the surge in inflation may be attributed to prices abroad, the effect of domestic price rises is certainly not negligible.",

        "The surprise in the March index compared with the forecasts was essentially due to the housing component, which rose by 0.4 percent against expectations of a 1.5 percent decline, and which continues to express the weakening of the link between changes in the NIS/$ exchange rate and housing prices.",

        "This fact, together with the Bank’s purchases of foreign currency (in the context of the program it announced of raising the foreign exchange reserves by about $10 billion in the next two years) could weaken the shekel, and counter the trend of the strengthening of the shekel evident in the last few months.",
        "If the shekel does weaken, the exchange rate will no longer offset the forces exerting inflationary pressure, as it did in the 2007 and the first quarter of 2008.",
        "The point was made that acting in the opposite direction to the inflationary forces were several factors tending to reduce those pressures, reflected by the assessments that the slowdown in growth in the US and the reduced expansion of demand in Europe and the rest of the world are expected to continue into 2009.",

        "According to the Bank of Israel forecasts, inflation measured over the previous next twelve months is expected to decline from its current level of 4.8 percent, to rise again towards the end of 2008, and to return to within the target range by the middle of 2009.",
        "In the first half of July there was a further rise in the nominal yield on government bonds, in addition to that which had taken place since March, following the rise in inflation expectations.",
        "However, following the publication of the June CPI, the yield on unindexed 5-year and 10-year government bonds fell from an average of 5.5 percent and 6.2 percent respectively in the first half of July to an average of 5.2 percent and 6 percent.",
        "Following the publication of the CPI, the yield on 5-year and 10-year CPI-indexed bonds rose to an average of 2.6 percent and 3.3 percent respectively, from an average of 2.4 percent and 3.2 percent in June and the first half of July.",

        "Various scenarios were examined using the Bank of Israel’s econometric models.",
        "The main assumptions this month were that demand from abroad and the rate of price increases of inputs were likely to moderate, that interest abroad would remain steady until the end of 2009, and that commodity prices would settle at their current level, According to the first scenario, using the Research Department’s quarterly model with the exchange rate around NIS 3.4 to the dollar in the next year-and-a-half, the interest rate would need to rise gradually until the end of 2009.",
        "In this scenario inflation would return to the target range in the first half of 2009.",
        "A scenario using the Monetary Division’s quarterly model showed that with the exchange rate in the next year-and-a-half around NIS 3.35 to the dollar, the derived Bank of Israel interest rate would rise to about 4.2 percent in the second half of 2008, and would decline gradually to 3.5 percent by the end of 2009.",
        "According to this scenario, inflation in the next four quarters would be 3.1 percent, and would return to the target range in the third quarter of 2009.",
        "In other words, both of the Bank’s econometric models indicate that an increase in the interest rate is required in order to return inflation to the target range within the next twelve months.",
        "their results naturally depend on certain assumptions about relevant variables, the scenarios should be viewed as one input among several in the discussions on the interest rate.",
        "During the month between the previous and the current interest rate discussions (22 June to 27 July), the shekel weakened against the dollar, from NIS 3.35 to NIS 3.49 to the dollar, a drop of about 4 percent.",
        "During the same period the shekel also weakened against the euro, from NIS 5.21 to the euro on 22 June to NIS 5.48 on 27 July, a fall of about 5 percent.",
        "From the time of the Bank’s announcement (on 10 July) that it was increasing the rate of its foreign currency purchases on the market from $ 25 million a day to $ 100 million until the current interest rate decision, the shekel has weakened against the dollar by about 8 percent.",
        "From the previous interest rate decision on 22 June until 27 July, the Tel Aviv 25 share price index reversed the trend of the previous month, and fell by 7.6 percent, in line with the reductions in the leading share price indices around the world.",

        "At the same time inflation is rising around the world, against the background of high commodity and oil prices.",
        "The upside inflation risk still exists, mainly related to concern over a second round of inflation, in which inflation could spread from the prices of oil and commodities to become more general.",
        "This month, however, saw a marked drop in the commodities and oil price index.",
        "The Commodities Research Bureau (CRB) index fell by about 11 percent in the last few weeks, having risen by 32 percent since the beginning of the year until the beginning of July.",

        "The discussions this month took place against the background of a high inflation environment, the June CPI that was surprisingly low, and the mixed picture that emerges from the latest data on real activity.",
        "The discussion focused on two main questions: 1) is inflation changing direction, and 2) do the latest data on economic activity indicate that economic growth has already slowed, and if so, to what extent?",
        "The participants in the discussions discussed the surprisingly low CPI in June.",
        "That index does not yet present a clear picture of the future path of inflation.",

        "Commodity and oil prices, which rose steeply in the last few months and constituted a major factor in the surge in global inflation and inflation in Israel, declined recently.",
        "It is too soon, however, to assess whether this represents a turning point or simply reductions that are part of current price volatility.",
        "Data from the Companies Survey and the composite state-of-the-economy index support the assessment that the economy has entered a period of slower growth.",
        "In addition, the strengthening of the shekel against the dollar since the beginning of the year serves to moderate exports and thus also economic activity.",

        "Concern over inflation made many central banks switch to tight monetary policies.",
        "On the other hand, the probability of an increase in the interest rate of the Fed, the ECB, and the Bank of England in the next few months has fallen.",
        "Three members of the management recommended that the Governor leave the interest rate unchanged, giving the following reasons: leading indicators show that the growth in real activity had slowed in the second quarter of 2008; there are signs of a reduction in the inflation environment, viz.",
        "the low June CPI and the reductions in commodity and energy prices in the last few weeks; the CPI excluding energy, food, and fruit and vegetables in the last twelve months rose by 1.9 percent, i.e., close to the midpoint of the target range; inflation expectations derived from the capital market fell sharply following the publication of the June price index; those members of the committee thought there was a good probability that inflation would return to the target range in the first half of 2009 without raising the interest rate for August; the probability of a rise in the interest rate of the Fed, the ECB or the Bank of England had declined; and the worsening of the global financial crisis in July had increased both the level of uncertainty in the financial markets and concern over a more serious and longer slowdown than expected previously.",
        "Two of the participants in the discussion recommended that the Governor raise the interest rate by 25 basis points, quoting the following arguments: despite the modest rise in the June CPI, inflation over the previous twelve months, 4.8 percent, is still significantly higher than the upper limit of the target range; the June index excluding fruit and vegetables rose by 0.6 percent, above the path consistent with the inflation target, following high rates of increase also in the previous few months; inflation expectations for periods longer than one year are still high, and raising the interest rate would help return them to the target range and reduce the long-term interest rate, which would support real activity; some data indicate continued expansion of real economic activity; although commodity and oil prices have dropped back in recent weeks, it is as yet unclear whether this is just a reflection of their price volatility or whether it indicates a change of direction; and both nominal and real interest in Israel are relatively low.",
        "After taking all the above into consideration, the Governor decided to raise the interest rate for August by 25 basis points to 4 percent, in order to support the return of inflation and inflation expectations to around the middle of the target range.",
        "The return of inflation and inflation expectations to the target range is an essential element in the support of sustainable growth.",
        "The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor economic developments closely, and will act as necessary to achieve price stability.",
        "Subject to this, the Bank will continue to support the attainment of a range of objectives of macroeconomic policy, in particular the encouragement of employment and growth.",

        "The Fed expects inflation to continue to rise in the near future and to moderate thereafter, in 2009 and 2010, in light of the predicted slowdown in global growth, the decline in commodity prices, the easing of pressures on production capacity, and the fact that inflation expectations are being held in check.",
        "Nonetheless, the Fed noted that uncertainty about the inflation outlook remains high against the background of the continuing rise in commodity prices and the danger that this trend may persist.",
        "At its last meeting, on 25 June, the Fed kept its interest rate unchanged at 2 percent, stating that it considered that the risks to growth had diminished somewhat.",

        "Nonetheless, there is growing evidence that economic growth in Europe is weakening, and it appears that this trend will become more pronounced in the next few months, particularly in light of the weakness in the US economy and the strength of the euro that adversely affect European exports, tight monetary conditions, and high commodity prices.",

        "The Fed also took special steps to provide liquidity to the market.",
        "On the other hand, the sharp increases in energy and commodity prices worldwide have increased fears of inflationary pressures.",
        "The Fed reacted to the US economy's weak performance and to the problematic functioning of the financial markets by lowering the interest rate by 0.75 percentage points to 2.25 percent on March 18[th].",
        "At the time of the Bank of Israel's interest rate discussions for the month of April, there was an expectation in the financial markets of an additional reduction by the Fed later in the year.",
        "In addition, there was an expectation of a lowering of the interest rate later in the year by the ECB and the Bank of England.",
        "One of the members of the committee participating in the discussion recommended reducing the interest month for the month of April by 0.25 percentage points.",
        "That member explained that the rate of inflation for the past 12 months had been above the path consistent with price stability and that expectations of inflation as derived from the capital market for the coming year, as well as the assessments of forecasters, are above the center of the target range.",
        "In the opinion of this member of the committee, a reduction of the interest rate was nonetheless recommended since current conditions justified accepting a somewhat longer deviation of inflation from the target range.",
        "This was particularly so in view of the fears of a global slowdown that would weaken global demand and reduce growth and inflation in Israel.",
        "The strengthening of the shekel in recent months, which is moderating inflationary pressures in the economy, is also providing support for a reduction in the rate of interest.",
        "The reduction in the rate of interest is expected to offset the effects of the strengthening of the shekel on economic activity.",
        "At the same time, the participant pointed out that a larger reduction than this in the rate of interest for April was not recommended, in light of the expectation that the shekel would weaken in the second half of the year, primarily in view of the assessment that the current account is expected to move from a surplus of about $5 billion in 2007 to a small deficit in 2008.",
        "This, together with the package of measures in the foreign exchange market (which was announced by the Bank of Israel) is expected to bring about a weakening of the shekel, i.e., the trend in the foreign exchange rate is not expected to continue its mitigating effect on inflationary pressure in the economy, as occurred during 2007 and the first quarter of 2008.",
        "Four members of the committee recommended reducing the rate of interest for April by 0.5 percent.",
        "In their opinion, it will be possible to achieve the inflation target for 2008 even if the rate of interest for April is reduced by this amount.",
        "This view is based on, among other things, the trend in inflation which was slightly below the center of the target range in 2007 (if the prices of food and energy are excluded).",
        "These participants explained that they do not expect that the increased prices of inputs will continue to be a major inflationary factor in 2008.",
        "These members of the committee stated that they attribute great weight to the expected effect of the global slowdown on the Israeli economy.",
        "In addition, the participants pointed to the strengthening of the shekel against other currencies, which is supported by the significant reductions in the Fed rate, as one of the main factors in their assessment.",
        "In their opinion, the reduction of the interest rate by 0.5 percent in April (following a similar reduction in March), together with the steps being taken by the Bank of Israel in the foreign exchange market, constitute a package of measures whose goal is to weaken the effect of the global slowdown on the Israeli economy.",
        "The Governor decided to reduce the interest rate for April by 0.5 percentage points.",
        "The following reasons were mentioned: - The decision to reduce the rate of interest by 0.5 percent in April is consistent with returning inflation to the price stability target of 1–3 percent before the end of the year.",
        "There are factors that are expected to moderate price increases.",
        "This month, as well, assessments became more certain that the deepening of the growth slowdown in the US and its expected continuation into 2009 can be expected to reduce inflationary pressures in the economy, both as a result of the probability of a reduction in the demand for Israel's exports, and in view of the weakening of local demand that will result, and of the wealth effect on demand.",
        "In addition, the strengthening of the shekel against the other currencies since mid-December is working to reduce the pressure for price increases in coming months, though to a smaller extent than in the past.",
        "The reduction in interest rates worldwide, and particularly the additional reduction of the Fed rate last month and the expectation of additional reductions worldwide, are supporting the value of the shekel and keeping inflation pressures in check in Israel.",
        "- The reduction in the interest rate by 0.5 percent points is likely to support the continued growth of the economy, which is an important consideration given the forecasts of a slowdown in global growth and its possible effects on the Israeli economy.",
        "In light of the above considerations, the Governor decided to cut the interest rate for April by 0.5 percentage points, to 3.25 percent.",
        "The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor economic developments closely with the intention of achieving the price-stability target.",
        "Subject to this, the Bank will continue to support the attainment of a range of objectives of macroeconomic policy, in particular the encouragement of employment and growth.",

        "The Fed's index of economic activity fell to its lowest level since 2001, which is consistent with the scenario of a slowdown in the American economy.",
        "Additional evidence of the economic slowdown can be seen in the record deficit in the federal budget in February that resulted from a drop in tax revenues and a high level of expenditure.",
        "Although the rate of unemployment fell from 4.9 to 4.8 percent in February, this was a result of a drop in the rate of labor force participation as unemployed individuals gave up searching for a job.",
        "An analysis by sector shows that the loss of jobs in the private sector was even larger and was partially offset by the addition of jobs in the public sector.",

        "At this stage the Bank of Israel does not have a precise estimate of the timing and extent of this effect, but the probability has increased that the slower expansion of world trade and the reduction in the growth rate of global demand are likely to reduce Israel’s growth rate to below the level of the last few years.",

        "The low rate of increase in the average real wage is explained by the fact that a large share of new jobs are part time, and are filled by new, lower-paid workers, and some are in industries that employ less-skilled employees, and is also partly due to the continued decline in tax rates on wages that have probably moderated wage demands.",

        "The participants in the discussion expect the easing of demand abroad and the strengthening of the shekel to act to slow the rate of growth and to moderate inflationary pressures in the economy.",
        "Three of the participants recommended cutting the interest rate by 0.25 percentage points.",
        "They argued that a cut of this magnitude reflected a balance between opposing forces.",
        "The inflation rate had surged in the last few months of 2007, and in January too was above the seasonal path consistent with the price stability target.",
        "They drew attention to the persistent inflationary pressures in the economy, and expressed disquiet that the return of inflation (measured over the previous twelve months) to within the target range might be delayed to beyond the middle of the year.",
        "Adding weight to their view was the narrowing of the output gap over the last year, which constituted an inflationary element as it allows price increases from manufacturers and importers to be passed on to consumers.",
        "These participants also noted that inflation expectations for one year forward derived from the capital market were above the midpoint of the target.",
        "Despite the above points, they recommended cutting the interest rate by 0.25 percentage points in light of both the strengthening of the shekel, which moderates inflationary pressures, and concern that the global slowdown would weaken demand and lower growth (and thus also moderate inflation).",
        "Two of the members of management recommended cutting the interest rate for March by 0.5 percentage points, arguing that even with such a reduction, the inflation target for 2008 could be achieved, based on the fact that inflation in 2007 excluding the food and energy components was slightly below the midpoint of the target range.",
        "They added that they did not expect the rise in commodity prices to continue to act as a major inflationary element in 2008.",
        "They explained that they placed great weight global slowdown on Israel’s economy.",
        "In addition, these participants in the discussion said that a central consideration in their view was the strengthening of the shekel against other currencies, which was supported by the sharp reduction in the Fed interest rate.",
        "They thought that a cut of 0.5 percentage points was required, and that it was preferable to make the reduction in one step.",
        "The Governor decided in favor of a cut of 50 basis points in the interest rate for March, citing the following reasons: - The decision to cut the interest rate for March by 0.5 percentage points is consistent with a return of inflation to within the target range of 1–3 percent inflation before the end of the year.",
        "Assessments are that inflation measured over the previous twelve months will return to within the target range during the second half of the year, and will be close to its midpoint towards the end of the year.",
        "Various factors are expected to lower inflationary pressures.",
        "The expectation has firmed that the more severe slowdown in growth in the US, Europe and Japan is likely to lower inflationary pressures in Israel, due to the likely drop in demand for Israel’s exports as well as the resultant drop in domestic demand.",
        "In addition, the strengthening of the shekel against other currencies since mid-December 2007 acts to lower the pressures for price increases in the next few months, even if to a lesser degree than in the past.",
        "The lowering of the global interest rate environment, and in particular the sharp cut in the Fed rate last month and the expectation of further reductions––in reaction to the slowdown in US growth and intended to achieve financial stability––serve to strengthen the shekel and to moderate inflationary pressures.",
        "- Subject to the expected reduction in inflationary pressures and a return of inflation to within the target range in the second half of 2008, the cut of 0.5 percentage points in the interest rate is likely to support continued economic growth, which is of special importance given the assessments of a slowdown in global growth and its possible implications for Israel’s economy.",
        "In light of the above considerations, the Governor decided to cut the interest rate for March by 0.5 percentage points, to 3.75 percent.",

        "The most recent data on economic activity in the first months of 2008 indicate a slowdown in growth in the services sector in Europe, which constitutes the major sector in the economy, to its lowest rate in four years, and a fall in consumer and business confidence indices.",
        "Inflation rose faster in January in the eurozone, and reached a rate of 3.2 percent percent, mainly due to the rise in energy and food prices.",

        "Nevertheless, the most recently published data point to a slowdown in growth, and an increase in downside risks to growth.",
        "Inflation rose in the last few months, and became positive, mainly due to the rise in oil and commodity prices.",

        "That said, the momentum of the rapid growth in the emerging markets in the last few years is likely to carry them through a period of a moderate global slowdown.",
        "The effect of global developments on the emerging markets is expected to be expressed in two ways: one is via the direct effect on activity through a drop in exports, and the other is the more indirect effect on liquidity, with the rise in risk aversion and tightening of credit terms that may lead to greater financing difficulties.",

        "Nevertheless, the Bank of Israel notes that the slowdown in growth in the advanced economies, particularly the US, is expected to affect Israel’s economy.",
        "In the last month the probability of a scenario in which a slowdown in the expansion of world trade and a fall in demand reduces Israel’s growth rate to 3.6 percent increased.",
        "National Accounts estimates indicate a continued rapid increase in GDP in 2007:Q4.",
        "According to those estimates, private consumption increased by 7.2 percent in 2007, investment in the principal industries rose by about 18 percent, exports (excluding diamonds) by 8.6 percent, and imports (excluding defense imports, ships, airplanes and diamonds), by about 14 percent.",
        "Public consumption increased by 2.6 percent in The composite state-of-the-economy index rose by 1.2 percent in December, a steep rise that supports the assessment that economic activity is expanding at a fast pace.",
        "The indices for the previous two months were revised upwards––the October index from a rise of 0.8 percent to 1.1 percent, and the November index from 0.6 percent to year was higher than that in the fourth quarters of 2005 and of 2006.",
        "All components of the index rose in December, with the exception of the index of manufacturing production (which dropped in November by 0.5 percent, following its sharp rise in October).",
        "In the whole of 2007, the composite index increased by 8.3 percent, after rising by The number of employee posts rose by 4.1 percent last year (August to October 2007 compared with August to October 2006).",
        "The (gross) real wage per employee post increased by one percent over the same period.",
        "This is explained by the fact that a large share of new jobs are part time, and are filled by new, lower-paid, workers, and some are in industries that employ less-skilled employees, and is also due to the continued lowering of tax rates on wages.",
        "Preliminary trend data of the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) show the rate of unemployment reached 6.6 percent of the civilian labor force in November; in other words, there are signs of a continuing decline in the unemployment rate.",

        "The government budget deficit, excluding credit, was essentially balanced in 2007.",
        "The very low deficit was the outcome of the sharp rise in tax revenues in 2007, some NIS 15 billion higher than the original budget forecast.",
        "The 2008 budget passed by the Knesset is in line with the original targets set by the government: a deficit ceiling of deducting expenses related to the Second Lebanon War and the disengagement from Gaza).",
        "The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 0.6 percent in December, above forecasters’ predictions prior to its publication.",
        "The part played by the increase in energy and food prices again featured prominently in the rise in the index.",
        "This was the second consecutive month with a high rise in the index in relation both to the path consistent with the inflation target and to prior assessments.",
        "In the course of 2007 the index rose by 3.4 percent, exceeding the inflation target.",

        "The Israeli forecasters expect, on average, that the cumulative change in the CPI in January to March 2008 will be a negative 0.2 percent.",
        "The Bank of Israel and the domestic forecasters expect inflation over the previous twelve months to come within the target range in the second half of 2008.",
        "It should be borne in mind that even when the monthly indices in 2008 become consistent with inflation of about 2 percent, inflation measured over the previous twelve months will return to the target range only in the second half of the year.",
        "The Bank of Israel’s assessments are that at the end of 2008 inflation over the previous twelve months will be close to the midpoint of the target range.",

        "The gap between the yields on unindexed shekel bonds and US 10-year bonds widened during the last month from 203 basis points on 26 December to 233 basis points on 13 January.",
        "The expected real interest rate (the Bank of Israel interest rate _minus inflation_ expectations) for one year forward was about 1.8 percent in December, a drop of about 0.2 percentage points from its rate in December, the result of expected inflation rising faster than the interest rate.",
        "The annual rate of increase of the (M1) money supply in January was about 18 percent (the increase over the previous twelve months).",
        "Various scenarios were examined using the Bank of Israel’s econometric models.",
        "According to the Research Department’s quarterly model, in which the closing of the output gap constitutes a dominant inflationary element, in the scenario in which the unemployment rate falls to 7 percent by the end of 2008, the exchange rate remains steady at around NIS 3.70 to the dollar, and the Bank of Israel’s interest rate stays at its current level of 4.25 percent, inflation in 2008 would be 2.2 percent.",
        "According to this model, if the recent trend of the reduced transmission between changes in the exchange rate and inflation (due largely to the weakening of the link between the exchange rate and housing prices) continues, inflation is expected to converge to the upper limit of the inflation target towards the end of 2008.",
        "According to the Monetary Department's quarterly model, in the scenario in which the Bank of Israel interest rate continues at the current rate of 4.25 percent in the first quarter of 2008 and then declines gradually to reach an average level of 3.7 percent in the last quarter, with an average exchange rate of about NIS 3.77 to the dollar in the last quarter, inflation would reach 1.6 percent in 2008.",
        "The results of the models are very sensitive to changes in the exchange rate.",
        "their results naturally depend on certain assumptions about relevant variables, the scenarios should be viewed as one input among several in the discussions on the interest rate.",
        "In the month since the previous interest rate discussions, the shekel strengthened against the dollar, from about NIS 3.88 to the dollar (on 24 December) to NIS 3.68 strengthened against the euro, from NIS 5.59 to the euro on 24 December to NIS 5.41 on 24 January, an appreciation of 3.3 percent.",

        "Israel’s risk premium as measured by the five-year CDS spread increased steeply this month from around 32 basis points to 55 basis points, its highest level since the outbreak of the global credit crisis.",
        "CDS spreads for most emerging market governments widened at similar rates.",
        "Attention in financial markets around the world was focused on the steep drops in share indices in stock markets everywhere, falls which reflect a growing concern that the slowdown in the US economy may be more severe than expected previously.",
        "Economists are of the view that the likelihood that global growth will slow has risen.",
        "Credit spreads in the US financial markets widened further this month.",

        "The investment houses on average expect a global growth rate of about 4.1 percent in 2008.",
        "The IMF expects the rate to be about 4.3 percent.",
        "The most recent data on inflation in the major economies are higher than expected.",
        "Energy prices, however, recently eased back from their peak level.",
        "The risks to US economic growth, instability in the financial markets, and the increase in the credit spreads were the main factors leading to the Federal Open Market Committee decision, in an unscheduled meeting, to announce a cut of 0.75 percentage points in its federal funds rate, to 3.5 percent.",
        "At the time of the current discussions on the Bank of Israel’s interest rate for February, the financial markets expect a further cut in the Fed rate at the next meeting at the end of January, with further reductions to follow in the course of 2008.",
        "Expectations regarding the ECB interest rate until the end of the first quarter of 2008 range from a reduction to no change.",
        "Against the background of developments since the previous interest rate decision on inflation would develop, particularly in light of the latest two CPIs which were unexpectedly high and above the seasonal path consistent with the inflation target.",
        "This occurred alongside increased concern that the slowdown in the US and in global growth would be more severe than originally expected––concern that was expressed, inter alia, in sharp drops in stock markets around the world, and that led to the unscheduled cut in the federal funds rate by 0.75 percentage points on 21 January.",
        "At the time of the discussion the Fed was expected to make another reduction in the interest rate in its scheduled meeting on 30 January, with further cuts to follow in the course of 2008.",
        "Participants in the discussion reviewed the implications of these developments and the growing uncertainty about global growth and growth in the US and in Europe in particular on inflation and economic growth in Israel.",
        "One of the participating department directors recommended cutting the interest rate for February by 0.25 percentage points, arguing that even with such a reduction, the inflation target for 2008 could be achieved, based on the fact that inflation in 2007 excluding the food and energy components was close to the midpoint of the target range.",
        "He added that he placed great weight on the increased probability of a significant cut in the Fed interest rate, which he thought would considerably lower the value of the dollar vis-à-vis the shekel, and reduce inflation.",
        "The other participants recommended leaving the interest rate unchanged at 4.25 percent.",
        "They explained that in their view the factors operating in different directions were in balance at this interest level.",
        "The intention was to return inflation (over the previous twelve months) to the target range about the middle of the year, and close to its midpoint by the end of the year, and to continue to underpin financial stability.",
        "They put forward the following considerations: - Inflation over the previous twelve months was expected to be above the upper limit of the target range in the next half year.",
        "Inflation expectations derived from the capital market are above the midpoint of the range (the average in January was about 2.5 percent), after rising in the previous month.",
        "- Economic activity continues to expand rapidly.",
        "The rising trend of commodity prices world wide (mainly food and energy prices) played a significant role in boosting inflation in the second half of 2007, against the background of buoyant demand in the economy and the closure of the output gap.",
        "- On the other hand, certain factors were acting to moderate the rise in prices.",
        "The expected slowdown in US and global growth is expected to ease inflationary pressures in Israel, due to the possible drop in demand for Israel’s exports as well as the possible negative impact on domestic demand.",
        "Likewise, the weakening of the global economy is expected to reduce global demand for energy products, whose steep price rises added to inflationary pressures in 2007 world wide and in Israel.",
        "- In addition, the cut in the Fed interest rate already made and the expectation of a further reduction, in reaction to the slowdown in US economic growth and intended to achieve financial stability, help to weaken the dollar.",
        "Although the connection between the shekel/dollar exchange rate and inflation has loosened somewhat in the last few months, the weakness of the dollar against the shekel serves to reduce inflationary pressures in Israel.",
        "In the discussion it was noted that unlike other economies, particularly the US, in which demand is expected to fall and where there is concern over a significant slowdown in growth, and in which problems have developed in the operation of the financial markets, Israel’s economy continues to expand at a fast pace, and the financial markets are functioning well.",
        "Taking into consideration all of the above, the Governor decided not to change the interest rate for February 2008 and to leave it at 4.25 percent.",
        "The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor economic developments closely with the intention of achieving the price-stability target.",
        "Subject to this, the Bank will continue to support the attainment of a range of objectives of macroeconomic policy, in particular the encouragement of employment and growth.",
        "In addition, the Bank will continue to support the stability of the financial system.",
        "The weakness of US economic data published this month surprised the market, and strengthened assessments that the US economy would experience a recession as early as in the first quarter of 2008.",

        "The rate of unemployment rose by a significant 0.3 percent, to 5 percent, an increase of 0.6 percent over the last two months.",
        "Housing market data continue to indicate deterioration, and the very high stock of unsold houses is not expected to fall in the near future.",
        "Data of the manufacturing sector generally indicate weakness, with the sector’s purchasing managers’ index showing a significant fall, and manufacturing production also performing weakly.",
        "Wholesale sales in December were disappointingly low, and consumer confidence surveys continue to point to a decline in confidence among American consumers.",
        "Against this backdrop, the investment houses assess that growth in the US will slow significantly in the first half of 2008.",
        "Many economists are now of the opinion that the US economy will actually go into a recession, but that it will be a short one, and not very severe.",

        "The US Consumer Price Index rose by 4.1 percent in 2007.",
        "Nevertheless, economists, including those in the Federal Reserve, expect that although inflation will remain high in the first months of 2008, it will ease back thereafter, in light of the expected economic slowdown.",
        "The Federal Open Market Committee took the exceptional step of reducing the interest rate on 21 January (a week before its scheduled meeting) by 0.75 percentage points to 3.5 percent.",
        "It did this against the background of the risks to US growth, instability in the financial markets, and the rise in credit spreads.",
        "At the time of the discussions on the interest rate for February in the Bank of Israel, the financial markets expect another cut in the Fed rate in the scheduled meeting at the end of January, and further reductions during 2008.",
        "Against the background of tighter financial conditions due to the crisis, growth in the eurozone slipped in the last quarter of 2007 and was expected to continue to slow in the first half of 2008.",
        "According to a survey conducted by the ECB in January, there was a further marked contraction of credit given to households and businesses.",
        "The strengthening of the euro during the last year also constitutes a factor acting to restrain growth.",
        "Data published this month indicate a slowdown in the manufacturing and services sectors, with consumer and business confidence indices also showing weakness.",
        "In contrast, the labor market remains strong, with unemployment in the eurozone falling to 7.2 percent, its lowest level for twenty-five years.",
        "Nonetheless, economists and the ECB see downside risks to growth.",
        "Inflation in 2007 was 3.1 percent, against the background of the rise in energy and food prices.",
        "The ECB expects inflation to stay above its target (less than 2 percent) in 2008, and that it will moderate gradually thereafter.",

        "In the discussion, it was noted that with labor productivity rising faster than wage costs, unit labor costs continue to fall.",
        "However in certain industries, particularly those that rely on skilled workers, the shortage of such workers has increased and nominal wages have risen relatively fast.",

        "In the background there is a possibility of a moderate rise in the Fed interest rate.",

        "The government budget continues to be a restraining factor on aggregate demand and the participants believed that the budget will remain relatively restrained for this year.",
        "In weighing up the various factors and influences on inflation, some of the participants in the discussion stressed that the recent strengthening of the NIS had the stronger effect, and would restrain inflationary pressures in the near future.",
        "Others emphasized that it was inadvisable to place too much weight on the recent strengthening of the NIS against the dollar, as the exchange rate can change rapidly in reaction to factors that affect the foreign currency market, and that these changes in the exchange rate very quickly affect the rate of inflation.",
        "In this analysis of the opposing forces that affect inflation, the econometric models supported the assessments that the moderating effect of the appreciation of the NIS was stronger and faster than the upward pressure on prices caused by the narrowing of the output gap.",
        "In summary, the departmental directors participating in the discussion were of the opinion that the strengthening of the NIS against the dollar from March to mid-May would exert a stronger effect in restraining inflationary pressures in the near future than the inflationary effects of the narrowing output gap.",
        "In addition, they observed that recent increase in the Bank of Israel’s interest rate, and the resulting rise in shortterm real interest, will continue to moderate demand to some extent, as the effect of the rise in interest has not yet been expressed in full.",

        "Despite this significant increase in wages, unit labor costs continued to fall, albeit at a slower rate than previously.",
        "The fast rise in wages together with a continued fall in unit labor costs points to a rapid rise in labor productivity, probably as a result of more intensive use of the capital stock.",

        "Most indicators of inflation from the financial markets point to continued stability or even improvement.",
        "Inflation expectations for the coming year as derived from the capital market fell slightly and stand close to the midpoint of the target range or a little under it.",
        "Individual forecasters also predict inflation in the next 12 months to be a little under the midpoint of the price stability target; at the same time the forecasters expect interest rate to be raised by up to 50 basis points in the second half of the year and expectations of a similar increase in interest were derived from the capital market.",
        "The discussion on the interest rate decision this month focused on the strength of the NIS in recent months and consequent restraint on inflation derived from it, when recently the foreign currency market has been stable.",
        "By contrast, there are significant inflationary pressures that are likely to impact the economy, which stem primarily from the process of a narrowing output gap accompanied by rising wages, as well as the expected reduction in the interest-rate differential between the Bank of Israel and the Fed.",
        "As in previous months, indicators of economic activity point to a continuation of the strong growth rate.",
        "The process of closing the output gap increases inflationary pressures through a direct impact on demand and, indirectly, through wage pressures.",
        "Regarding wage developments, the participants in the discussion stressed the rise in nominal wage costs already registered in the business sector in the past year (about 7 percent in the 12 months to March), while the shortage of skilled workers in a number of sectors is increasing.",
        "On the other hand, at this stage, the increase in productivity is faster than the rise in wages so unit labor costs continue to fall.",
        "The assessment in the discussion was that the increase in productivity is being accompanied by an increased utilization of capital, and that there are signs of this process nearing its conclusion.",
        "Also in the discussion, fears were raised of the possibility of future inflationary pressures that could result from increased wages in the public sector, following the expected signing of a new wage agreement in the sector in the second half of the year.",
        "With regard to the effect of fiscal policy, the participants in the discussion estimated that fiscal policy would exert a restraining influence, particularly through 2006, and would continue to operate with a target budget deficit of 2 percent of GDP in 2007 while striving toward a balanced budget by 2009.",
        "This policy aims to continue strengthening the macroeconomic framework of the economy, including by reducing the government debt burden.",
        "It was also noted in the discussion that the July 1 reduction in the VAT rate is expected to contribute to a one-time reduction in the price level of about 0.3 percentage points in the short term, though in the medium term the reduction of this tax contributes to expanding demand and pressure on prices.",
        "The expected rise in the US interest rate at the end of June and the consequent parity between the Bank of Israel interest rate (if there were to be no change in the Bank of Israel rate) and that of the Fed, is in itself an inflationary factor, as it makes the outflow of capital more attractive in the short term.",
        "However the participants in the discussion estimated that under the present conditions of the international economy, including the probability that the dollar will continue to weaken against other currencies, the closing of the NIS/$ interest rate gap would not be expected to have a significant effect on the exchange rate.",
        "Fluctuations in the NIS exchange rate against the dollar in the past month were relatively modest, while the NIS strengthened.",
        "The strength of the NIS in the foreign currency market is explained by the positive evaluation of the Israeli economy, with an update last month that raised the official data on the current account surplus in the balance of payments, and by continuing inflows of medium and long term capital.",
        "The recent stability of the NIS contrasted with the considerable depreciation in the exchange rates of some emerging market countries, and sharp falls in share prices in a number of countries.",
        "Share prices also fell in Israel in the past month, though to a lesser extent than in most emerging market countries.",
        "Most participants in the discussion believed that medium- and long-term capital inflows are likely to continue to support the continued relative strength of the NIS.",
        "However, a number of participants stressed the risk factors that could weaken the NIS, including geopolitical developments.",
        "The assessment in the discussion was that under present circumstances and in light of the economic situation and the continuing capital inflow, the exchange rate development was a factor that balanced the inflationary pressures resulting from the narrowing of the output gap.",
        "The importance of the exchange rate developments on inflation was raised in the discussion as well as several scenarios, analyzed through models, that the departments presented.",
        "In one such simulation, using a model of the Monetary Department, the closing of the output gap, the upward path of the dollar interest rate and the recent increase in energy prices lead to a moderate raise in the interest rate in the second half of the year and an inflation rate of 2.5 percent over the next 12 months.",
        "In weighing up the overall picture, the participants in the discussion were of the opinion that the stability of the NIS exchange rate, the rise in the real short-term interest rate, the continued fall in unit labor costs, the strong fiscal position, and the cut in VAT were decisive in arguing for not increasing the interest rate, despite the inflationary forces resulting from the narrowing of the output gap and the reduction in the interest-rate differential between the Bank of Israel and the Fed.",
        "In assessing these considerations, all the department directors who participated in the discussion recommended that the interest rate for July be left unchanged.",
        "The Governor decided not to change the interest rate, which will remain at the level of",
        "Before the Governor makes the monthly interest rate decision, discussions are held at two levels.",
        "The first discussion takes place in a broad forum, in which the relevant background economic conditions are presented, including real and monetary developments in Israel’s economy and developments in the global economy.",
        "Participants in this discussion include the Governor, the Deputy Governor, the directors of the various economic departments of the Bank (the Research, Monetary, Foreign Currency, and Foreign Exchange Activity departments) and economists from various departments who prepare and present the material for discussion.",
        "In the narrow forum, the directors of the economic departments present their recommendations regarding the interest rate, and following a discussion, the Governor makes his decision.",
        "The data on real activity indicated that the economy was recovering rapidly from the impact of the war in the north in the third quarter.",
        "The adverse effect on economic activity turned out to be smaller than originally assessed, and it seems that the rate of growth in 2006 will be slightly higher than earlier estimates, and is expected to reach National Accounts data for the third quarter reflect the slowdown in economic activity during the hostilities in the north.",
        "Seasonally adjusted data show that GDP declined in that quarter at a rate of 1.4 percent (in annual terms).",
        "In the third quarter goods and services exports dropped by 22 percent, with marked reductions in tourist services exports, and civilian imports of goods and services fell by about 20 percent.",
        "In contrast, domestic defense consumption rose by some 22 percent.",
        "Private consumption rose by 3.4 percent, and investment in the principal industries surged by about 23 percent.",
        "The rapid rise in investments is in line with investors’ assessments that the effect of the war was only temporary.",
        "The composite state-of-the-economy index rose in October by 0.6 percent.",
        "The index of manufacturing production from the beginning of the year to September was 8 percent higher than in the equivalent period in 2005.",
        "Activity in the construction industry gave no signs of recovery, and building starts in January–July 2006 were 7.4 percent lower than in January–July 2005.",

        "Tax revenues in 2006, including those from the sale of Iscar, are expected to exceed the budget forecast by some NIS 10 billion.",
        "Data on the government’s budget to October indicate that tax revenues have recovered rapidly since the fighting.",
        "Expenditure from the beginning of the year up to October was some NIS 1.4 billion in excess of the original seasonal budget path, mainly due to payments from the war damages compensation fund being recorded as expenditure.",
        "At the time of the discussion, the assessment was that the total deficit in 2006 would be less than 2 percent of GDP.",
        "The Consumer Price Index (CPI) dropped steeply again in October, by 0.7 percent, following its 0.9 percent decline in September.",
        "The fall in October was greater than that expected by private economic forecasters, most of whom had estimated drops of between 0.2 percent and 0.5 percent.",
        "The decline in the index was due mainly to the appreciation of the shekel and the fall in housing and fuel prices.",
        "In the last twelve months the CPI has fallen by 0.2 percent, and since the beginning of 2006 it has risen by 0.1 percent.",
        "The rate of inflation is below the lower limit of the seasonal path consistent with the inflation target.",
        "Inflation expectations to one year ahead derived from the capital market––break-even inflation––rose moderately from October to November, by 0.1 of a percentage point, to 1.5 percent.",
        "This contrasts with their sharp 0.5 percentage point fall in October.",
        "From January 2005 to September 2006 these expectations were close to 2 percent, the midpoint of the inflation target range.",
        "The average of Israeli forecasters’ assessment of one-year inflation is 2.1 percent.",
        "They assess that the Bank of Israel’s interest rate will stabilize, and that in twelve months’ time it will be 5.0 percent.",
        "By contrast, the makam curve reflects expectations of a lower interest rate in the next twelve months.",
        "In the month prior to the interest rate decision, five-year CPI-indexed interest rates went down by 0.1 of a percentage point to 3.6 percent, and 10-year indexed rates to and on 9-year bonds it declined by 0.2 of a percentage point, to 5.9 percent.",
        "The Before this interest rate decision, the Bank of Israel interest rate was the same as that of the Fed.",
        "US capital market data indicate a strong probability of no change in the US federal funds rate in the coming months.",
        "The gap between the unindexed shekel yield curve and the US 10-year bond curve remained steady during November at 130 basis points.",
        "As a result of the cut in the Bank of Israel interest rate for November and the modest rise in inflation expectations, the expected real interest rate for one year forward fell in November by 0.4 of a percentage point to 3.8 percent.",
        "This followed its rise in October.",
        "The growth rate of the money supply (M1) over the previous twelve months has been slowing since the beginning of the year and in October it stood at 5.6 percent, down from 11.5 percent in September.",
        "The various scenarios that were examined using the Bank of Israel’s econometric models showed that achievement of the inflation target over the next twelve months would require a cut in the interest rate, as a result of the nominal appreciation of the shekel and the fall in energy prices.",
        "A cut in the interest rate is necessary to bring inflation back gradually into the target range.",
        "The strengthening of the shekel in the last few months occurred against the background of a surplus in the balance-of-payments current account that is expected to exceed $ 6 billion in 2006, and foreign investment in Israel.",

        "In November the shekel weakened a little against the dollar.",
        "In the days immediately preceding the interest rate decision for November the exchange rate was around NIS 4.28 to the dollar, and at the time of the meeting it is around NIS 4.30.",
        "The shekel also weakened against the currency basket in November, from NIS 4.82 at the time of the previous interest rate decision, to NIS 4.90 in the days prior to the current decision.",

        "A few central banks––among them those of Sweden, Norway, England and Australia––raised their interest rates this month.",
        "The inflation rate in the last twelve months was significantly below the target range, and stands at –0.2 percent.",
        "The inflation estimates and expectations to twelve months ahead are lower than the midpoint of the target range.",
        "The major factors behind the reduction in the inflation environment in the past two months are the strengthening of the shekel and the drop in global energy prices.",
        "Together with the drop in the inflation rate, private forecasters expect a cut in the Bank of Israel interest rate for December and, on average, expect the interest rate to stabilize at a level of 5.0 percent in the next twelve months.",
        "By contrast, the capital market assessments, according to the yield curve, are for an additional cut in the interest rate during the next year.",
        "The Bank of Israel’s assessments and models indicate a high probability that the rate of inflation in the next few months will remain below the lower limit of the target range.",
        "Participants in the discussion related to scenarios tested by the various econometric models according to which it was possible to permit a negative interest rate gap between the Bank of Israel and the Fed.",
        "The speed with which inflation returns to within the target range and the level of interest rate required for it to do so are conditional to a considerable extent on future developments in the exchange rate and energy prices.",

        "At the same time no inflationary pressures from the labor market are evident, as unit labor cost is showing a gentle downward trend due to the rapid rise in labor productivity.",
        "Budget data pointed to a marked recovery in tax revenues, which are expected to total in 2006 about NIS 10 billion more than originally forecast, and public expenditure some NIS 3 billion more than originally budgeted.",
        "At the time of the discussion the assessment was that the budget deficit for 2006 would be less than 2 percent of GDP.",
        "Israel’s financial indicators strengthened further in the past month.",
        "In the international financial markets, Israel’s risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, contracted slightly.",
        "The yield gap between 10-year Shahar bonds and US government bonds of the same term stabilized in the past month.",
        "The shekel weakened slightly in the past month, possibly as a result of the interest rate cut in October, despite the background of an outstanding surplus in the balance-of-payments current account, and substantial foreign investment in Israel.",
        "Considering developments in the foreign exchange markets worldwide, foreign investment houses expect the dollar to weaken, with a high probability.",
        "A decision to cut the Bank of Israel interest rate for December by 0.25 of a percentage point would lead to the Bank of Israel interest rate being below that of the US Federal Reserve by 0.25 of a percentage point.",
        "The participants examined the possibility of a greater reduction in the interest rate for December but decided that moving to a negative interest rate differential between the Bank of Israel and the Fed demanded a gradual approach, in order to assess developments in the financial markets.",
        "This gradual approach to interest rates is important given the possibility of rapid changes in the inflationary environment and the need to avoid shocks in the financial markets.",
        "Moreover, several participants noted that a fundamental change in monetary conditions was not required at the moment to encourage economic activity, which continues to expand rapidly, with an expansion too in the private consumption component.",
        "To summarize: the decline of inflation to below the target range, the effect of the factors behind the strengthening of the shekel on inflation, and the decline in global energy prices all support a lowering of the interest rate for December.",
        "On the other hand, economic activity is continuing to expand rapidly.",
        "The objective of the Bank of Israel’s monetary policy is to bring inflation gradually back to around the midpoint of the target range without causing unnecessary shocks in the financial markets.",
        "In view of these various considerations, all the department directors who took part in the discussion recommended that the interest rate for December be cut by 0.25 of a percentage point.",
        "The Governor decided to reduce the rate for December by 0.25 of a percentage point to 5.0 percent.",
        "The process by which the Governor makes the monthly interest rate decision consists of discussions at two levels; the first in a broad forum, and subsequent discussions in a narrower forum.",
        "In the broad forum the relevant background economic conditions are presented; these include real and monetary-financial developments in Israel's economy, and developments in the global economy.",
        "Participants in this discussion include the Governor, his deputy, the directors of the various economic departments in the Bank (the Research Department, the Monetary Department, the Foreign Currency Department, and the Foreign Exchange Activity Department), and economists from the different departments who prepare and present the material for discussion.",
        "In the narrow forum, the department heads present their recommendations regarding the interest rate decision, and following a discussion of the possible courses of action, the Governor makes his decision.",
        "In assessing the state of the economy on the real side, attention was paid to the situation before the outbreak of hostilities in the north and the initial assessments of its affect on activities.",
        "National Accounts data for the first quarter of 2006, together with current data on economic activity, point to continued rapid growth: an increase of 6 percent in GDP was led by an increase in domestic demand.",
        "According to the Bank of Israel's Companies Survey, all industries reported a continued rise in activity in the first quarter, with the manufacturing, commerce, business services and hotel industries reporting relatively strong growth in activity definition of GDP to make it conform to the accepted international definition.",
        "According to the previous definition, GDP increased in the first quarter by 6.3 percent (in annual terms).",
        "while transport and communications and construction saw more modest growth.",
        "The leading index of the Companies Survey pointed to a high likelihood of further expansion of activity in the third quarter of 2006.",
        "It should be noted that this leading index was based on companies' expectations for the coming quarter, surveyed before the outbreak of fighting in the north.",
        "almost all tourist activities in the area at the height of the summer season, and to the partial or complete shutdown of most industries in the north.",
        "From past experience, in such circumstances foreign tourism is generally affected fastest and more sharply and recovers slowly after an improvement in the security situation.",
        "As a measure, a drop of 50 percent in incoming tourism in the third and fourth quarters of 2006 would lead to a contraction in GDP of 0.4 percent.",
        "Assuming that the fighting will continue for a month, and given that about 15 percent of business sector activities is in the north–– with part of this shut down either completely or in part––we can estimate that the loss of GDP, beyond the affect on tourism, will be about 0.5 percent.",
        "An escalation of the fighting could affect real activities also through an indirect affect on major macro variables such as investment and private consumption.",
        "Exports could also be affected, beyond the damage to the export of tourist services.",
        "However a fast and successful completion of the fighting would result in relatively minor damage to the economy.",
        "The composite state-of-the-economy index rose by 0.7 percent in June, prior to the outbreak of fighting in the north.",
        "The manufacturing production index showed a continuing positive trend.",
        "The increase in the composite index was a result mainly of increases in the manufacturing production index and the index of trade and services revenue.",
        "This was partly moderated by a fall in the import of goods.",
        "Foreign trade figures for the export of goods (excluding diamonds, in current dollars) point to a continued positive trend for exports, a trend that began in recent months after some slowdown in the export of goods in the second half of 2005.",
        "Imports of goods (excluding diamonds, fuel, ships and planes) showed a continuation of a moderately increasing trend led by the imports of raw materials.",
        "Imports of investment goods showed no rising trend.",
        "This was apparently due to the fall in imports of security goods which are partly registered as imports of investment goods.",
        "Furthermore, the rate of increase that began in recent months in the imports of consumer products, was less than 5 percent (in annual terms).",
        "Labor market data for March and April point to a rise of almost 5 percent in wages per employee post, compared to a rise of 5.3 percent in the business sector in the parallel period last year.",
        "This rise was led by the business services, banking and manufacturing industries.",
        "Given that the business sector registered the same rise in wages (compared to the parallel period of last year) in January and February, the rise in wages is not seen as a result of one-off payments such as bonuses or payments prior to privatization, but expresses a rise in employee wages in these industries.",
        "In public services the rise in wages was a more moderate 3.2 percent.",
        "In the first half of 2006 there was a cumulative surplus of NIS 4.7 billion in the general government budget (excluding the provision of credit), reflecting a higher level of tax revenues than that forecast in the budget and a lower level of spending, seasonally adjusted.",
        "As a result, the budget deficit is expected to total between 0.5 and The fighting in the north is expected to lead to a rise in expenditure on current defense spending and a fall in tax income following the impact on activity, though it is still too early to gauge the effect.",
        "The government has expressed its intention of maintaining its budget targets for 2007.",
        "Accordingly increases in expenditure as a result of the fighting will need to lead to a change in spending priorities but no change in total government spending.",
        "Total income from taxes (discounting for legislative changes and one-time revenues) grew in real terms in the second quarter by almost 8 percent (compared to the parallel quarter of last year).",
        "This follows a 10 percent rise in the first quarter.",
        "The increase in income from taxes was led by the increase in income from direct taxes, against the background of a rise in wages and in profits for companies and the self-employed.",
        "The rise in income from indirect taxes was more moderate.",
        "The Consumer Price Index rose by 0.1 percent in June, and by 3.5 percent in the past to the increase in the index.",
        "The CPI for June was higher than forecast by the Bank of Israel and the average expectations of private forecasters.",
        "Components of the index that rose by more than forecast were housing, clothing and footwear, and food.",
        "In the first half of 2006 the CPI increased at an annual rate of 2.7 percent (seasonally adjusted), which is near the upper limit of the inflation target range (1-3 percent).",
        "During the first half, energy prices contributed about 0.7 percent of the rise in CPI (or contributed to a moderation of the rise in the CPI.",
        "The fall in demand likely to result from the fighting in the north––principally through a decline in private consumption and investment––will moderate the rise in prices.",
        "In the short term, the reduction in activity will also reduce supply, and is expected to lead to a rise in selected prices (for example, fruit).",
        "The rise in the economy's risk premium tends to reduce the pressures for the appreciation of the NIS, thereby putting pressure on prices.",
        "Inflation expectations for the next 12 months derived from the capital market in July average inflation expectations derived from the capital market after the outbreak of fighting rose slightly, apparently expressing a modest rise in the risk premium concerning possible developments of prices in the economy.",
        "Breakeven inflation rates for the medium and long terms (up to 10 years) are near the upper limit of the inflation target range, at 2.7 percent on average; taking into account estimates of the risk premium, expected inflation is probably around 2.2 percent.",
        "Forecasters' expectations of inflation in the next 12 months increased following the outbreak of hostilities in the north by about 0.6 percentage points to an average of 2.3 percent.",
        "The range of forecasts is wide, stretching from 1.8 to 3.0 percent.",
        "Their forecast for inflation in the coming months were also adjusted upward by an average of 0.3 percentage points.",
        "Average forecasts for July expect a fall of 0.1 percentage points in the CPI and for August an average increase of 0.4 percentage points.",
        "As derived from the average makam curve for July, the interest rate is expected to rise by about 0.4 percentage points over the next 12 months.",
        "Forecasters raised their assessments of raises in the interest rate following the outbreak of fighting in the north, and these now (as of July 23) stand at an expected rise of 25 basis points in August and a further 25 basis point-raise in interest in September.",
        "The forecasters also predict that the Bank of Israel will raise rates by a further 25-50 basis points by the end of the year.",
        "In 12-months hence, they expect, on average, that the interest rate will reach 6.25 percent compared to their previous forecast of 5.75 percent.",
        "Developments of nominal and real yields in the government bond market were relatively stable in July, after a trend of rising yields in the first four months of the year.",
        "Nominal and real long-term yields reached 6.5 and 4 percent, respectively.",
        "The relative stability of yields continued after the outbreak of fighting in the north and was influenced by the government budget surplus in the first half of the year.",
        "The interest rate differential between the Bank of Israel rate and the US Federal Reserve rate contracted to zero after the Fed raised its rate by 25 basis points at the end of June, in line with expectations.",
        "Market expectations (as of July 23) are that the Fed will raise its rate a further 25 basis points in August though the probability that the markets ascribe to this raise has fallen.",
        "In addition, the expectations are that if the rate is raised, this will be the last in a session of interest rate rises that began two years ago.",
        "Nominal yield gaps between Israel and the US for five- and 10-year terms continued to contract in July, reaching 1 and 1.2 percent respectively.",
        "Real yield gaps for these terms also contracted in July both reaching 1.3 percent.",
        "However there was some rise in these gaps after July 15.",
        "The expected short-term real interest rate on Bank of Israel sources, which has been on a rising trend since the last quarter of 2005, stood at 3.5 percent in July, compared to an average 2.7 percent at the start of the year.",
        "The annual rate of increase of the money supply (M1) has been on a downward trend since the beginning of the year, and stood at 15.5 percent in June.",
        "This is still though a higher rate than the forecast GDP growth rate with the expected rise in prices.",
        "Since the beginning of the year, the cash component of the money supply increased by 5 percent, while the checking account component increased more moderately by 1.6 percent.",
        "The annual rate of increase of broad money (M2) continued to fall in June and was slightly below 3 percent.",
        "The annual rate of growth of total banking credit (C3) in the first half of the year reached about 7 percent on average, against the background, inter alia, of a continued rapid growth in the economy and a fall in the rate of increase of nonbanking credit sources.",
        "Various scenarios that were examined using econometric models developed by the Bank of Israel show that the rise in the prices of imported goods, particularly energy prices, constitutes a factor for continuing price increases.",
        "The main channel by which the fighting affects inflation is through its effect on the exchange rate.",
        "In various scenarios some increase in the interest rate is required during the year in order to keep inflation within the target range.",
        "In the past month nonresidents were net sellers of bonds and shares on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange.",
        "In contrast, falling prices in the emerging markets led Israeli households to sell investments in mutual funds specializing in foreign investments, leading to a net inflow of capital to the economy.",

        "From the discussion on the policy rate for July (on June 26) until the outbreak of fighting in the north, the NIS strengthened against the dollar by 1.8 percent against a background of a weakening dollar globally and a continued inflow of capital into the economy.",
        "In the first three days of fighting the NIS weakened by 3 percent with daily volatility increasing sharply from 6 percent to about 12 percent.",
        "With the outbreak of hostilities daily trading volumes soared, reaching a new record of $ 3.4 billion spreads reached a high level of 10 agorot.",
        "Despite this, there was no halt in normal trading and there were no signs of market failures.",
        "After a number of days the trends moderated and the exchange rate stabilized around NIS 4.46 to the dollar, showing a depreciation of around 2 percent since the outbreak of the fighting.",
        "High levels of activity were also recorded on the side of foreign investors during the period of fighting in the north, with their buying more than $ 1 billion net.",
        "The share of nonresident activity in market activity increased since the outbreak of fighting and reached an average of 33 percent, compared to an average of 28 percent in the second quarter of 2006 and 21 percent in 2005.",
        "After the outbreak of fighting in the north, the stock market saw increased volatility and the leading indices, which fell initially by around 12 percent, later made some recovery, such that the overall fall in indices from July 12 to July 20 was 6 percent.",
        "Israel's risk premium, as measured by the 5-year CDS spread, increased in the week following the outbreak of fighting in the north by 7 basis points to 37 bp.",
        "Ten-year CDS spread increased by the same amount.",
        "Trends were mixed in other emerging markets.",
        "Credit rating agencies Fitch and Standard & Poor's published updates on the latest developments in Israel in which they kept Israel's credit ratings unchanged and the economic outlook at \"Stable\".",
        "In their announcements, the agencies noted the Israeli economy's strong starting point which, together with a responsible fiscal policy, is expected to limit the negative economic implications of the hostilities.",
        "The reviews of foreign investment houses published after the outbreak of fighting expressed confidence in the Israeli economy and noted that for as long as the fighting did not escalate and that the government maintained its budget framework, the negative economic implications of the fighting were limited.",
        "Furthermore they stressed that despite the slight impact on the economy, the NIS was not expected to continue weakening.",
        "Global growth remained strong, though the rate of growth is expected to slow down, particularly in light of the expected fall in US domestic demand.",
        "Nevertheless, most forecasts point to a \"soft landing\" of the US economy.",
        "The expected slowdown in the US will be moderated by faster growth in the euro zone, Japan and the emerging markets.",

        "AUGUST 2006 The discussions this month took place against the background of the fighting in the north and the possible implications for the Israeli economy, both on real activity and on inflation and the financial markets Basic economic data are strong, and, according to the indicators in general prior to the fighting, point to rapid growth in the economy.",
        "Rapid growth leading to a narrowing output gap, and higher import prices, particularly energy prices created inflationary pressures.",
        "The impact of these factors on prices was partly tempered by the continued appreciation of the exchange rate, particularly as a result of the current account surplus and long-term capital inflow to the economy by nonresidents.",
        "At the time of the meeting the 12-month inflation rate stood at 3.5 percent, above the upper limit of the target inflation range of 1-3 percent a year.",
        "Prior to the outbreak of fighting, the assessment was that the 12-month inflation rate would return to within the target range in the coming month, despite the inflationary effects of growth and higher import prices.",
        "This was based mainly on the assumption that the factors behind the NIS' appreciation would continue.",
        "The discussion concentrated on the possible effects of the fighting on the economy's real activity, on inflation, on the foreign currency market and on the financial system, and covered also the factors that could determine the strength of these effects.",
        "The aim was to obtain the clearest macroeconomic picture possible given the uncertainty surrounding the fighting and its outcome.",
        "With the economy on a path of continued rapid growth and a narrowing output gap, the fighting has added uncertainty over this growth and its strength.",
        "The effects of the fighting depend in large part on its military and geopolitical outcome.",
        "Even assuming a rapid and successful end to the hostilities, the fighting will likely affect both the supply side of the economy––that is the economy's production capacity––and the demand side, in light of the effects of greater uncertainty and fall in income on private demand.",
        "According to Bank of Israel calculations the damage to real activity is expected to total up to 1 percent of GDP.",
        "The major harm on real activity will be felt through tourism.",
        "Even after the security situation improves, recovery of incoming presented in the appendix.",
        "A further component is the shutdown of economic activity in the north.",
        "Until the outbreak of fighting in the north, the economy enjoyed an inflow of longterm capital through the surplus in the current account of the balance of payments, which reached around an annual rate of $ 3 billion in the first half, and from an inflow of foreign investment.",
        "All of this encouraged an appreciation of the NIS.",
        "The fighting in the north is expected to affect this trend, given the possible reduction in foreign investment and current account surplus, particularly through the possible drop in tourism.",
        "The measure of the damage is also dependent on the developments of the fighting and its outcome, though assuming a quick and successful end to hostilities, the damage will be relatively moderate.",
        "The financial markets reacted with stability to the events in the north.",
        "Though share prices fell and the NIS depreciated, these changes occurred within the first few days of fighting.",
        "Afterward, the cumulative drop in share prices contracted and the exchange rate strengthened somewhat.",
        "During the whole period of the fighting the markets functioned well, with particularly high volumes of trade, especially in the foreign exchange market.",
        "This picture is based probably on the firm economic foundations of the Israeli economy, investors' confidence––both nonresident and local––in macroeconomic policies and the assessment of a quick and successful end to the fighting.",
        "In this context, it was very important that the government declare its commitment to the budget framework for 2006 and 2007, despite the expected increase in certain expenditure items connected with the fighting and its economic implications, and a decline in tax income given the possible affect on activity.",
        "Against the background of fighting in the north Israel's risk premium increased, albeit at a relatively modest rate.",
        "Since the outbreak of hostilities, the CDS index increased only moderately, and the credit rating agencies and investment houses which reexamined the Israeli economy did not change their assessments.",
        "It is important to note that according to them, the economy's commitment to pursue its macroeconomic policies was the most important factor affecting their decision.",
        "The 10-year interest rate gap with the US also rose by 15 basis points.",
        "As for inflation, apparently the factors that up to now have created pressure on inflation––these being the effects of continued fast growth and the increase in import prices, particularly energy prices––are continuing to operate.",
        "If the inflow of capital into the economy––which led to an appreciation of the NIS and hence a moderating force on prices––does contract, then the factors pushing prices up will be stronger than before.",
        "The long-term possible damage of the fighting on private sector demand will create a moderating force on price rises.",
        "However in the short term, the effect will be to raise prices given the more immediate impact on supply.",
        "Some of the participants in the discussion recommended that the Governor raise the interest rate for August by 25 basis points.",
        "They were of the opinion that the factors creating inflationary pressures were expected to continue, while the factors moderating the rise in prices would subside, and that while the possible slowdown in activity would be a moderating force on prices, this effect would not be present in the immediate term.",
        "Furthermore, and more importantly, they believed that it was important to take the increase in Israel's risk premium into consideration.",
        "It is important to note that the extent of the increase in the risk premium depends on policy responses, both fiscal and monetary.",
        "Therefore, they argued, current circumstances dictate a raise in the interest rate as part of this policy in order to maintain price stability, according to the inflation target, and to support the financial stability of the economy.",
        "By so doing, these participants argued, the Bank would contribute to strengthening the future growth of the economy.",
        "Some of the participants in the discussion recommended that the Governor leave the interest rate for August unchanged.",
        "They were of the opinion that greater weight should be given to those factors acting to moderate the rise in prices relative to others, and to the stability demonstrated by the financial markets even at a time of hostilities.",
        "The probability that stability would continue was high, and the expected reduction in capital inflows and the rise in the economy's risk premium in the eyes of investors, would be moderate.",
        "Furthermore, the impact of capital movements on the exchange rate, and through that on prices, would continue to be moderate.",
        "The possible damage of the fighting on real activity, principally through a fall in demand, will also act to moderate the rise in prices and therefore these participants believed that the interest rate at the time of discussion could maintain price stability.",
        "The Governor decided to raise the interest rate by 25 basis points to 5.5 percent for August.",
        "In reaching this decision, the Governor ascribed a decisive weight to the rise in the economy's risk premium, in light of the fighting, and also to the continuation of inflationary factors that had operated in the first half of 2006.",
        "The Governor was of the opinion that this decision would increase the chances of a rapid recovery from the estimated damage to economic activity as a result of the fighting and after it is over.",
        "This was an important step in an overall macroeconomic policy that contributes to strengthening the infrastructure for sustainable growth in the economy while maintaining price and financial stability.",
        "Before the Governor makes the monthly interest rate decision, discussions are held at two levels.",
        "The first takes place in a broad forum, in which the relevant background economic conditions are presented, including real and monetary developments in Israel's economy, and developments in the global economy.",
        "Participants in this discussion include the Governor, the Deputy Governor, the directors of the various economic departments in the Bank (the Research Department, the Monetary Department, the Foreign Currency Department, and the Foreign Exchange Activity Department), and economists from the different departments who prepare and present the material for discussion.",

        "Some of the lost activity in manufacturing and trade and services is expected to be recouped by the end of 2006.",
        "Activity is expected to recover quickly, so that the main effect on growth will be felt in the third quarter of 2006, and the decline in growth will turn out to be a temporary halt.",
        "The revised growth forecast for the year is about 4.5 percent, compared with 5.5 percent before the outbreak of the fighting.",
        "Sales of retail chain stores (seasonally adjusted) declined by 3.7 percent in July, but this was not necessarily entirely due to the hostilities, as the index had fallen also in May (by 1.8 percent) and in June (by 1.5 percent).",

        "The decline encompassed all manufacturing industries, but to different degrees: exports of chemicals dropped by 27 percent, reverting to their level at the beginning of the year, while exports of electronic components, computers, machinery and equipment posted an 8 percent fall.",
        "Exports were adversely affected by the temporary disruption of normal activity in factories and by transportation problems arising from the closure of Haifa port.",
        "Employment Service data for July indicate that the number of vacancies rose in July in the Jerusalem region and in the south, did not change in the central region, and declined in the north.",
        "Unlike in previous months, when budgetary expenditure was consistent with the seasonal pattern, in July it rose significantly faster than indicated by the normal seasonal path.",
        "At present it is expected that in 2006 the budget will be implemented in full, unlike in previous years, and that income will fall short of the estimate prior to the hostilities by about NIS 2.3 billion (although it will still be some NIS 7 billion higher than the budget estimate).",
        "Assuming that the fighting in Lebanon will result in a one-percent loss of GDP in 2006, the deficit in 2006 is expected to be about 2 percent of GDP.",

        "Over the last twelve months the CPI rose by 2.4 percent, and has thus returned to within the target inflation range.",
        "Inflation since the beginning of 2006, 2.2 percent at an annual rate, seasonally adjusted, is also consistent with the target.",

        "The principal effects on inflation that were prevalent prior to the fighting will likely apply in the future too; demand pressures on resources are expected to continue, albeit at a more moderate rate, and long-term capital movements are likely to put pressure on the NIS to appreciate.",
        "The participants in the discussion discussed how the fighting in the north of the country had affected economic activity.",

        "However, the fall in the growth rate due to the fighting in 2006 is expected to be only temporary, with some of the losses in manufacturing, commerce and services being recouped by the end of the impact of the fighting on aggregate demand is not expected to be significant, as the fall in private sector demand will be partially offset by the expected increase in government expenditure.",
        "At the same time, the impact on supply is likely to be shortlived.",
        "Assessments regarding the absence of a significant change in aggregate demand together with the limited and temporary impact on supply leads to the conclusion that the fighting is not expected to have much impact on price development.",
        "The participants in the discussion concentrated on the assessments regarding the fiscal cost of the fighting and its repercussions on budgetary policy.",
        "In this context, it was noted that the size and composition of the budget for 2007 was now more uncertain.",
        "The budgetary cost of the hostilities includes one-time expenses such as payments for direct and indirect damage as a result of the fighting, and replenishing army stocks.",
        "In addition, there have been demands for extra funds to raise the level of military preparedness and for new projects.",
        "In the discussion the participants stressed that, at the time of the meeting, before the government makes its 2007 budget decisions in early September, there was considerable uncertainty regarding the size of these increased expenditures, as well as the significant difference between one-off expenses and those that would constitute a basic part of the budget in coming years.",
        "Regarding budgetary pressures, it was also noted that adhering to the budget framework––and with it, the deficit––would help the economy remain stable and strengthen foreign and local investors' confidence in the economy.",
        "Despite the increased uncertainty caused by the hostilities in the north, the participants noted the firmness of the financial markets in Israel during the period of fighting and afterward, which demonstrated robustness and strength.",
        "The fighting did cause a rise in the economy's risk, though after the fighting the risk premium as measured by the five-year CDS spread fell back to levels prevalent prior to the outbreak of the hostilities.",
        "The NIS remained stable and during the month was even stronger than it was prior to the fighting.",

        "It was also noted that unlike in recent months when energy prices had risen, the price of oil globally had stabilized and had even begun to fall––a factor expected to moderate pressures on prices in the short term.",
        "Overall there were several major factors that supported the maintenance of price stability: the convergence of inflation to the mid-point of the target range together with assessments that the hostilities' impact on economic activity will be temporary and will not be accompanied by any significant effect on prices; the robustness of the financial markets; and the positive interest rate differential between the Bank of Israel and the Fed, which supports the stability of the NIS.",
        "These factors were judged to be dominant despite the increased uncertainty regarding the growth in government expenditure and the expected changes in the state budget for 2007.",
        "In assessing these considerations, all the department directors who participated in the discussion recommended that the interest rate for September be left unchanged.",
        "The Governor decided not to change the interest rate, which will remain at the level of 5.5 percent for September.",

        "The most recent data come mainly from the Companies Survey for the first quarter of 2006.",
        "They indicate that growth is continuing and becoming more broadly based, and that companies expect the expansion to persist in the next quarter.",
        "The current indicators show a continuation of the upward trend in sales of the retail chain stores and in tourism, in trade and services revenue, in the index of manufacturing production, and in the number of employees.",
        "The considerable increase in tax revenue, particularly direct taxes, is consistent with the continued expansion of economic activity.",
        "The Companies Survey indicates that the expansion of economic activity, which spread to all the principal industries, continued to become more firmly established in the first quarter of the year.",
        "The increased activity included both domestic sales and exports.",
        "Construction companies reported increased building activity in the first quarter, after a constant level of activity in the previous three quarters; they expect the upward trend to continue in the next quarter.",
        "In the manufacturing, transport and communication industries companies reported a shortage of skilled workers.",
        "Economic growth in recent months was reflected by the most recent data on several other indicators, including the composite state-of-the-economy index, which rose by reflect the positive trend it has shown during the last three years.",
        "The positive trend in the seasonally adjusted index of trade and services revenue persisted in January, although the rate of increase moderated.",
        "The seasonally adjusted index of manufacturing production rose slightly in January, and this taken together with the positive trend data indicates that the expansion shown by this index has become more firmly established in the last few months.",
        "The index of tourist bed nights also showed a rise in February, continuing the positive trend evident in the last few months.",
        "Trend data for the first quarter of 2006 indicate a decline in exports, despite the fact that the seasonally adjusted index of manufacturing exports was 3.3 percent higher in February than in January.",
        "The trend data indicate that imports remained steady, with imports of raw materials and consumer goods rising and those of capital goods falling, following two years of acceleration in imports of inputs (from the second quarter of The latest data on the labor market show a continuation of the upward trend in employment in January (an increase of 2.9 percent from January 2005).",
        "At the same time there was a moderate rise in the nominal wage, while the real wage per employee post has been declining for seven months.",
        "Hence, at this stage of rising demand and the gradual narrowing of the output gap, the upward pressures on wage costs are not yet reflected in real wages.",
        "The budget performance since the beginning of 2006 is consistent with an annual deficit below the ceiling of 3 percent of GDP.",
        "Between January and March 2006 there was a cumulative budget surplus of NIS 7.8 billion (excluding credit).",
        "This surplus reflects the continued acceleration in tax revenues, and a contractionary level of expenditure below the seasonal path.",
        "In the absence of an approved budget, the monthly expenditure ceiling is determined on the basis of one-twelfth of the previous year's budget.",
        "Tax revenues rose by 12.8 percent in real terms in the first quarter of the year relative to those in the first quarter of 2005 (after making adjustments for legislative changes and differences in the timing of tax receipts).",

        "In those three months CPI inflation exceeded the Bank's forecasts.",
        "In the last twelve months the CPI rose by 3.6 percent, and the wholesale price index by 7.6 percent, the latter reflecting price increases in most of the principal industries.",
        "Inflation expectations for the next twelve months derived from the capital market decreased to 1.9 percent in the first half of April, from 2.1 percent in March and 2.2 percent in February.",

        "The rise in the money supply exceeded the rise expected from econometric equations of the demand for money.",
        "Alternative scenarios examined using the econometric models of the Research Department and of the Monetary Department show that the narrowing of the output gap, together with the rise in prices of inputs and the rise in the dollar interest rate abroad are affecting the rate of inflation at the current rate of interest, and that a rise in the interest rate is required in order to achieve the annual inflation target of between 1 percent and 3 percent in 2006.",

        "In some surveys of foreign investment houses there is a belief that the real exchange rate of the NIS is undervalued, and most foreign banks expect the NIS to continue gaining strength, based on the macroeconomic data on the economy, the expected interest rate in Israel, and the dollar's global weakness.",
        "The optimism of foreign investors toward the NIS is reflected in the net sale of dollars and purchase of NIS in the past month.",
        "Although the level of uncertainty has apparently abated, many foreign investment houses note that the possibility of government budget overspending could pose a risk to Israel's capital markets and to the NIS.",

        "The wholesale price index rose in the past 12 months at a relatively high rate and this could reflect price rises that have yet to work their way through into the CPI.",
        "The discussion participants noted that some rise in interest was required to restore inflation gradually to within the target range.",
        "This would be a continuance of the interest rises in the past few months and takes account of the time lag between implementation and effect.",
        "Despite the rise in the interest rate, according to forecasts, inflation over the past 12 months will exceed the target for a number of months, until its expected return to within the range in mid-2006.",

        "The unemployment rate, though relatively high, is on a downward trend which is expected to continue.",
        "The gradual reduction of excess capacity in production––which results from demand expanding faster than the expansion in supply––creates upward pressure on prices.",
        "The narrowing output gap exerts pressure on prices both through demand, directly influencing prices of goods, and through pressure on wages leading to higher production costs.",
        "It was noted that up to now, unit wage costs had not risen though there were indications that in some industries the shortage of skilled workers had increased.",
        "Given the narrowing surplus production capacity, the probability was growing that growth in the economy would find expression in rising prices.",
        "Until the Knesset approves the budget for 2006, government spending follows the law on the absence of an approved budget, whereby monthly expenditure is limited to one twelfth of the previous year's budget.",
        "This rule dictates a tight budgetary policy for the period until the new budget is approved.",
        "Participants expected that the fiscal framework for the rest of the year would remain relatively restrictive.",
        "In recent weeks the NIS strengthened against the dollar and the currency basket, together with an expectation that interest will rise slightly in the major world economies.",
        "The strengthening of the NIS against the dollar was influenced by both local and global factors, though the weakening of the dollar globally was the main force behind the strengthened NIS against the US$.",
        "At a more fundamental level, the prevailing estimate was that long-term players were continuing to bring considerable amounts of long-term capital into the economy.",
        "The inflow of long-term capital into the Israeli economy can be explained by increasing flows of capital into the emerging markets in general and by the strength of the Israeli economy in particular.",
        "The strengthening of the NIS acts as a counterbalancing force against inflationary pressures.",
        "In summary, an environment of inflation higher than the 12-month target together with persistent upward pressures on prices were the primary factors underlying the discussion.",
        "In the discussion, views were that the interest rate should be raised this month in order to reduce gradually the inflationary environment and to return it to its target.",
        "The factors expected to push prices up this coming year and which supported the argument for raising the interest rate this month were the continued gradual narrowing of the output gap and the rise in energy prices.",
        "Against this, the strengthening of the NIS in the forex market moderates the upward pressure on prices.",
        "In the light of the above considerations, the department directors each recommended that the Governor raise the interest rate for May by 25 basis points.",
        "The Governor decided to raise the interest rate for May by 25 basis points to 5.25 percent.",
        "Before the Governor makes the monthly interest rate decision, discussions are held at two levels.",

        "According to the assessments presented at the meeting (which took place a few days before the publication of the Central Bureau of Statistics’ initial estimates for 2006) GDP growth was expected to reach 4.8 percent in in 2006 and by 7.1 percent in 2007.",
        "The rise in fixed investment reflects the increase in investment in the principal industries, particularly in machinery and equipment, whereas investment in housing is not yet showing an increase.",
        "The outstanding feature of the balance of payments is the current account surplus, which is expected to reach close to 5 percent of GDP in 2006.",

        "The surplus is expected to continue rising in The rate of participation in the labor market (seasonally adjusted) in the third quarter of 2006 was 55.6 percent, similar to the rate in the fourth quarter of 2005; the rate of unemployment fell to 8.3 percent, down from 8.8 percent in the last quarter of 2005.",
        "Most of the increase in the number of employees occurred in the business sector, with an average increase of 70,000 in the first three quarters of 2006 compared with the equivalent period in 2005.",
        "Unit labor costs, after falling in the last two years, rose somewhat in the third quarter of 2006.",
        "This was due to the rise in the hourly cost of labor while productivity remained steady, apparently because of workers’ absence from work during the war in the north.",

        "The decline in November was in line with that expected by private economic forecasters, and was due mainly to the appreciation of the shekel against the dollar and the fall in the prices of housing, transport and communications.",
        "In the last twelve months the CPI has fallen by 0.3 percent, and since the beginning of 2006 by 0.1 percent.",
        "The sharp drop in inflation is to be seen against the background of the strengthening of the shekel against the dollar by 8.5 percent in the last twelve months, and the rapid impact of changes in the exchange rate on inflation in Israel.",
        "The rate of inflation is below the lower limit of the path consistent with the inflation target.",
        "The division of the components of the CPI into those directly affected by the exchange rate and the energy component on the one hand, and “domestic” components not affected by them, on the other, points to a substantial difference between them––the “domestic” price component rose in 2006, while the “imported” price component fell.",

        "The gap between the yields for 10-year unindexed shekel bonds and US bonds of the same term contracted significantly during the last month from 130 basis points to As the cut in the Bank of Israel interest rate for December was similar to the drop in inflation expectations, the expected real interest rate for one year forward remained unchanged in December at about 3.8 percent.",

        "In 2005 the money supply increased by 24 percent.",
        "The various scenarios that were examined using the Bank of Israel’s econometric models showed that in the scenario that included a cut in the interest rate and the consequent nominal depreciation of the shekel, inflation would return to within the target range in the last quarter of 2007.",
        "The various models showed that a reduction of the interest rate to 4.5 percent in the first quarter of 2007 would lead to the convergence of the inflation rate to within the target range in the last quarter of 2007.",
        "The strengthening of the shekel in the last few months occurred against the background of a surplus in the current account of the balance of payments that is expected to exceed $ 6 billion in 2006, and heavy foreign investment in Israel.",
        "It is assessed that the current-account surplus could reach 6 percent of GDP in 2007.",
        "During the last month the shekel strengthened against the dollar.",

        "The Fitch ratings agency raised Israel’s foreign-currency and local-currency credit rating outlook from “stable” to “positive.” In its announcement, Fitch noted the improved dynamism and resilience of Israel’s economy following the reforms implemented in the last few years.",

        "Prior to the decision for January, the expectation derived from the capital market was of a reduction of 30 basis points during the next year.",
        "The participants in the discussion related to the scenarios derived from the econometric models, according to which, subject to a reduction in the interest rate, there is a relatively high probability that inflation would revert to the target range in the last quarter of 2007.",
        "The return to within the target inflation range and the rate of interest required for this depend to no small degree on the future changes in the exchange rate.",

        "In the international financial markets Israel’s country risk premium, as measured in the 5-year CDS market, declined.",
        "The yield gap between 10-year Shahar bonds and US government bonds of the same term narrowed considerably.",
        "The Fitch ratings agency raised Israel’s foreign-currency and localcurrency credit rating outlook from “stable” to “positive.” Much of the discussion focused on the analysis of the factors causing the strengthening of the shekel, which was one of the major reasons for the reduction of inflation to below the lower limit of the target in the last few months, and that even led to negative inflation rates.",
        "Changes in the exchange rate are known to have an immediate impact on inflation in Israel.",
        "As noted above, the division of the CPI into two major groups of components shows a significant difference between them in directly affected by the exchange rate and energy prices.",
        "The strengthening of the shekel reflects several positive developments, with the rise in the current-account surplus and the growing confidence of foreign investors in Israel’s economy––reflected by the amount of foreign investment––at the top of the list.",
        "In addition, the greater openness of the economy to external factors, most recently via the implementation of the reform regarding market makers in the governmentbond market, boosted the demand of financial entities for long-term government bonds of the Shahar type.",
        "As mentioned above, this led to the narrowing of the yield gap between these bonds and US government bonds of the same 10-year term.",
        "The data on real activity continue to indicate that the economy is still enjoying a high rate of growth.",
        "Assessments presented in the discussion pointed to growth of 4.8 percent in 2006 and 4.6 percent in 2007 (the initial estimates of the Central Bureau of Statistics were published a few days after this discussion).",
        "The impact on GDP of the war in the north in the third quarter of 2006 was smaller than the Bank of Israel’s earlier assessment.",
        "The rise in investment in the principal industries supports the assessment that activity will continue to expand.",
        "The rate of unemployment fell from that reduction, no inflationary pressures from the labor market are evident at this stage, and the real wage has edged up only slightly.",
        "Unit labor costs rose slightly in the third quarter, but have been on a downward trend for two years as a result of the rapid rise in productivity.",
        "Budget data pointed to continued recovery in tax revenues, and the deficit in the 2007 budget in accordance with the framework approved by the government, so that the deficit in 2007 will not exceed the government ceiling of 2.9 percent of GDP.",
        "The discussion focused on the size of the cut in the interest rate for January with the aim of achieving the inflation target in 2007.",
        "Some participants argued in favor of a reduction of 25 basis points, while others supported a cut of 50 basis points.",
        "The former favored a reduction that was in line with the market expectations, i.e., 25 basis points, that would be accompanied by a statement that it was highly probable that a further cut of another 25 basis points would be made next month.",
        "They argued that this was preferable to the alternative of a cut of 50 basis points now, taking into consideration that it was not advisable to widen the differential between the shekel interest rate and the Fed rate by such a large amount so rapidly, and to avoid the surprise that would be caused by a larger-than-expected cut.",
        "Avoiding a surprise reduction in the interest rate would lower the probability of market shocks.",
        "Moreover, the positive data on activity and investments support the view that it is not necessary to introduce a substantial change into the monetary conditions to encourage activity, as this is continuing to expand at a fast pace in any case.",
        "Those participants favoring the smaller cut in the interest rate considered that this was consistent with the achievement of the inflation target in 2007.",
        "Other participants were of the opinion that it was better to reduce interest for January by 50 basis points.",

        "The major arguments for raising the interest rate by 25 basis points to 3.75 percent were: - The expected rapid growth this year and next, and with it the further contraction in the output gap (the difference between the actual output of the economy and the output it could reach at full capacity) are reflected in inflation in local prices, as estimated by the Bank of Israel's econometric models, which continue to rise by a rate of more than 3 percent.",

        "- Recently, the probability of a rise in the global inflation rate has increased following a sharp rise in the prices of oil and basic foods.",
        "These are likely to raise import prices and this will constitute an additional factor in pushing up prices in the economy.",
        "- Given the trend of raising interest rates in the world against a background of an increasing probability of a rise in the global inflation rate, the positive interest rate gap between other countries and Israel is likely to rise, and to affect the movement of short-term capital.",
        "This tends to weaken the shekel and thus contributes to higher inflation, and in addition could be a factor leading to financial instability.",
        "In the discussion, the following points were raised in favor of leaving the interest rate unchanged: - Assuming that the exchange rate were to remain around its level at the time of the discussion, inflation would be likely to stay within its target range, even without an increase in the interest rate.",
        "Furthermore, underlying factors that act to strengthen the shekel, such as the surplus in the current account of the balance of payments, continue to operate.",

        "Against the background of developments since the previous interest rate decision on 29 October 2007, the discussion focused on participants’ assessments of inflation developments, including an analysis of the factors affecting the shekel exchange rate, and on economic growth and its effect on inflation.",
        "The participants discussed the effect of the increase in the last month in uncertainty about global growth, and particularly about growth in the US, and the implications of these developments on the Israeli economy.",
        "All the department directors participating in the discussion recommended leaving the interest rate unchanged this month at 4.0 percent.",
        "They gave the following as the main reasons for their recommendation: - At the current level of the interest rate, the weakening of the dollar vis-à-vis the shekel offsets the inflationary pressures in the economy.",
        "Increased uncertainty in the last month about developments in the US economy strengthened the expectations of another cut in the Fed interest rate, serving to further weaken the dollar world wide.",
        "The weakening of the dollar against the shekel has a moderating effect on prices in Israel.",
        "On the other hand, the rapid growth in 2007 and the attendant contraction of the output gap creates upward pressure on prices.",
        "This month there were further rises in world energy prices, over and above the steep increases in energy prices since the beginning of the year, as well as increases in world food prices.",
        "- This month too the assessment of the Bank of Israel is that maintaining the interest rate at its current level is consistent with achieving the target of price stability in the next 12 months, based on, inter alia, expectations derived from the capital market, private forecasters’ predictions, and judgments regarding various scenarios examined using the Bank of Israel's models.",
        "Increases in the CPI in the coming months are expected to be low as a result of the weakening of the dollar, and the inflation rate for 2007 is expected to be within the inflation target range.",
        "The financial markets expect no change in the interest rate in the next few months, and a moderate rise in the course of 2008.",
        "- With regard to the possibility of the US economy slowing down more severely than expected, the point was made in the discussion that if this occurs in the first half of financial effect of the crisis in the US mortgage market is already reflected in lower interest rates in the US, which in itself weakens the dollar world wide.",
        "It would take longer for the possible real effects of the crisis to extend to the Israeli economy, and there is a higher degree of uncertainty relating to them.",
        "In this context it was observed that given the uncertainty about developments in the global economy and their possible implications for Israel’s economy, it is of even greater importance that the budget be passed in accordance with the guidelines set, so as to increase the chances of maintaining the growth trend in 2008 and beyond.",
        "The participants in the discussion analyzed the progress of the exchange rate.",
        "Attention was drawn to the weakening of the dollar around the world.",
        "Assessments were presented predicting an easing of the pressures for the strengthening of the shekel in account of the balance of payments.",
        "In addition to the expected reduction of the current account surplus, it was noted that in 2008 long-term capital imports may decline somewhat, with institutional investors still exporting capital at a rate similar to that in The strong pass-through mechanism in the short run between changes in the exchange rate and changes in inflation was also discussed.",
        "The significant decline in the last year in the share of new rental contracts linked to the dollar was noted––these dropped from about 85 percent of all contracts in January 2007 to about 68 percent in October.",
        "This trend, boosted by the weakening of the dollar, has some effect in loosening the strong pass-through mechanism between changes in the exchange rate and house rental costs.",
        "Taking into consideration all of the above, and as the weakening dollar against the shekel offsets the inflationary pressures associated with the closing of the output gap, the Governor decided to leave the interest rate for December 2007 at its current level of The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor economic developments closely with the intention of achieving the price-stability target.",
        "Subject to this, the Bank will continue to support the attainment of a range of objectives of macroeconomic policy, in particular the encouragement of employment and growth.",

        "In its quarterly update issued this week, the Federal Reserve lowered its forecast growth for The expectation regarding the US housing market suggests that the situation has deteriorated, and the assessments are that the stock of houses available for sale, which is at a very high level, will not drop in the near future.",
        "This, because of the fall in house prices, the rise in mortgage costs, and more stringent credit terms.",
        "The deterioration in the housing market together with the increase in energy prices and the tightening of credit conditions present a downside risk to households’ and companies’ costs.",
        "In addition, the latest survey also showed a sharp decline in consumer confidence.",

        "The October CPI showed a 3.5 percent rise over the previous twelve months.",
        "Core inflation figures, however, are significantly lower, and are at a level of 2.2 percent against the background of the rise in the prices of energy, raw materials and food, and the depreciation of the dollar that resulted in a rise in import prices, the Fed is concerned over inflation risks.",
        "On the other hand, a slowdown in the rate of growth is expected to ease the inflationary pressures.",
        "At its last meeting, at the end of October, the Federal Reserve cut its funds rate by rate at the next FOMC meeting on 11 December with a high degree of probability, and assess that the interest rate will continue downwards during 2008.",
        "Growth in the euro bloc accelerated in the third quarter of the year and based on assessments of the investment houses it seems that the effect of the turbulence in the financial markets on growth is expected to remain limited.",
        "The IMF gives a similar assessment in its half-yearly regional economic outlook for Europe published in November.",
        "However, as noted by the ECB, the level of uncertainty remains high, due to the crisis in the financial markets.",
        "The risks of a slowdown in growth in Europe arise from the strengthening of the euro, the rise in oil prices, more stringent credit conditions, and the expected slowdown in the US economy.",
        "In October the rate of inflation (measured over the previous twelve months) rose notably, to 2.6 percent, against the background of the rise in energy and food prices.",

        "Growth in Japan increased in the third quarter, reaching 2.6 percent (annual rate), after slowing down considerably in the second quarter, with exports providing the major impetus.",
        "However, domestic demand is not increasing, and consumer confidence has been dropping sharply since May, against the background of the standstill in wages.",
        "In addition, the slowdown in the global economy, the rise in energy and commodity prices, and the recent steep decline in building starts are expected to restrain future growth.",
        "The Bank of Japan cut its growth forecast for 2007 this month from 2.1 percent to 1.8 percent, but kept its forecast for 2008 unchanged at 2.1 percent.",
        "In the revised forecast, inflation is expected to remain at zero in 2007, and to become positive in 2008.",
        "As expected, the central bank kept the interest rate unchanged at 0.5 percent this month.",
        "Based on investment houses assessments and interest rate futures, on average a rise in the interest rate is expected only in 2008.",
        "Global growth is supported by strong growth in the emerging markets, particularly the impressive growth in China and India.",
        "It is apposite in this context to note that in its half-yearly economic outlook the IMF revised its forecasts of growth in East Asia upwards to 8.4 percent in 2007 and 8.2 percent in 2008.",
        "The IMF also predicted that economic activity in South America would remain robust in 2008, although growth would be dampened by the expected slowdown in the US economy.",
        "However, foreign direct investment in the emerging markets, which have hitherto been unaffected, may suffer from the consequences of the increased severity of financial conditions in the advanced economies.",

        "The data on real activity continue to indicate a high rate of growth.",
        "No inflationary pressures from the labor market are evident as yet, due to the rapid rise in productivity that caused a reduction in unit labor costs.",
        "However, the rate at which unit labor costs are falling has slowed.",

        "In the discussion it was noted that hitherto, over the last year, the strengthening of the shekel––including its effect on housing prices––has been a key cause of negative inflation.",
        "All the departmental directors participating in the discussion recommended leaving the interest rate unchanged for April.",
        "They expressed the view that rapid economic growth in the year ahead together with the narrowing of the output gap would create inflationary pressures that would help to return inflation to within the target range.",
        "They noted that the fall in the rate of unemployment to 7.7 percent in the last quarter of 2006 strengthens the assessment that the process of closing the output gap is proceeding faster than could have been assumed previously, and increases the probability that inflationary pressures will develop in the course of the year ahead.",

        "Currently, following the cuts in the interest rate by the Bank of Israel, the Bank’s interest rate was 1.25 percentage points lower than the Fed rate.",

        "- Israel’s sovereign risk premium rose significantly this month, as reflected in part by the widening of the yield gap between 10-year shekel bonds and 10-year US bonds, and by the increase in the 5-year CDS spread.",
        "In addition, the discussion focused on the question of by how much to raise the interest rate.",
        "The reasons for recommending a relative modest rise in the interest rate were: - Various economic fundamentals still supported the strength of the shekel, such as the current account surplus and foreign investment in the economy.",
        "In addition, in the last month expectations of rises in interest rates around the world had eased, and in the US a cut in the rate was expected as early as in September.",
        "The positive interest rate differential between other countries’ interest rates and that in Israel was thus expected to narrow, and this in itself would help strengthen the shekel.",
        "The point was made in the discussion that in the last month the shekel had strengthened against the dollar and the euro, to some extent offsetting the inflationary pressure exerted by domestic demand.",
        "Participants in the discussion drew attention to the rise in interest on long-term government and corporate bonds, which in itself constitutes a restraining factor.",
        "They also noted that despite the rise in uncertainty in many financial markets, those in Israel nevertheless functioned well and liquidity problems had not arisen, unlike what had occurred in several advanced economies.",

        "The unchanged CPI in December was slightly higher than the average of the forecasts, and was in line with the seasonal path consistent with the inflation target.",
        "In the last twelve months the CPI fell by 0.1 percent, so that inflation in 2006 was lower than the target.",
        "The sharp drop in inflation is to be seen against the background of the strengthening of the shekel against the dollar by 8.2 percent in 2006 and the rapid and heavy impact of changes in the exchange rate on inflation in Israel.",
        "If the components of the CPI are divided into those directly affected by the exchange rate and the price-of-energy component, on the one hand, and “domestic” components not affected by them, on the other, it can be seen that the “domestic” components of the price index rose in 2006 by more than 2 percent, while prices of the “imported” components of the index fell.",
        "Inflation expectations to one year ahead derived from the capital market––break-even inflation––continued along their downward path, and in January stood at an average of about 1 percent, after falling to about 1.3 percent in December from 1.5 percent in November.",

        "The gap between the yields on 10-year unindexed shekel bonds and US bonds of the same term contracted significantly during the last month from 104 basis points to As the previous cut in the Bank of Israel interest rate, for January, was greater than the drop in inflation expectations, the expected real interest rate for one year forward fell in January from a level of 3.9 percent to about 3.6 percent.",

        "In 2005 the money supply increased by 24 percent.",
        "The various scenarios that were examined using one of the Bank of Israel’s econometric models showed that in the scenario that included a cut in the interest rate and the consequent nominal depreciation of the shekel, inflation would return to within the target range in the last quarter of 2007.",
        "The elements in the model acting to lower the interest rate derive from the appreciation of the shekel against the dollar in the last three quarters, and the low rate of inflation in the last quarter of 2006.",
        "According to the model, these factors are conducive to low rates of price increases also in the first quarter of 2007.",
        "In the month since the last interest rate decision, the downward trend of the NIS/$ exchange rate (i.e., the strengthening of the shekel against the dollar) halted.",
        "Nevertheless, the underlying conditions of the current account surplus and nonresidents’ investments in the economy constitute basic forces for real appreciation.",
        "As mentioned above, the positive trend in the current account surplus is expected to continue in 2007, and to rise to more than 5 percent of GDP.",
        "During the last month the shekel weakened a little against the dollar.",

        "The foreign investment houses continue to describe Israel’s economy in a positive light, and commend its strong macroeconomic performance.",
        "Specifically, they emphasize the buoyant rate of growth, the current account surplus, and the extent of direct investment, all of which are expected to continue along the positive trend in activity than are other emerging markets, it is less vulnerable to a possible rise in risk aversion among foreign investors.",
        "Most of the investment houses expect the shekel to continue its strong performance, although a possible deterioration in the geopolitical situation in the region or a greater-than-expected slowdown of growth in the US economy that would affect emerging markets in general and Israel in particular still constitute risk factors.",
        "Global growth is expected to remain high in 2007, and according to the IMF forecast is expected to reach 5 percent, compared with 5.1 percent in 2006.",

        "In the three months from September to November 2006 the CPI fell by a total of almost 2 percent, and the index for December remained unchanged.",
        "The participants in the discussion stressed that the low rate of inflation was expected to continue in the first quarter.",
        "The assessment was that the rate of inflation viewed retrospectively over twelve months for the first quarter would be negative, and only in the second quarter would the monthly CPI inflation figures rise to rates in line with the target inflation path.",
        "Given the negative rate of inflation, viewed over the previous twelve months, in recent months, inflation is expected to remain below the target range for most of discussion, as well as the Bank of Israel's equal treatment of a deviation from the target, whether it had undershot or overshot it.",
        "Prior to the interest rate decision for February, the expectation derived from the capital market was of a reduction in the interest rates during the coming year following the recent drop in inflation.",
        "Private forecasters expected the Bank of Israel interest rate to be around 4.5 percent at the end of 2007.",
        "According to the scenarios derived from the econometric models, subject to a reduction in the interest rate, there is a relatively high probability that inflation would revert to the target range in the last quarter of 2007.",
        "The return to within the target inflation range and the rate of interest required for this depend to no small degree on the future changes in the exchange rate.",
        "In the month prior to the current interest rate decision the financial indicators in Israel continued to strengthen.",
        "In the international financial markets Israel’s country risk premium, as measured in the 5-year CDS market, continued to decline.",
        "The yield gap between 10-year _Shahar bonds and US government bonds of the same term_ continued to narrow, and in the past month narrowed considerably.",
        "The strengthening of the shekel, which acted to push inflation down, expresses several positive developments reflecting the reduction in Israel's country risk premium.",
        "In 2006, the growth in the current-account surplus stood out, and this is expected to grow further in 2007.",
        "Fiscal discipline was also impressive.",
        "Despite the hostilities in the north and the associated government expenditure, the budget deficit for 2006 totaled about 0.9 percent of GDP, lower than the budget ceiling.",
        "In 2007 too the budget deficit is expected to be lower than the ceiling approved by the Knesset of foreign investors in Israel’s economy, reflected by the amount of foreign investment.",
        "As in the past, the participants stressed the relatively strong and rapid effect that the exchange rate has on inflation in Israel.",
        "The shekel's strengthening against the dollar in previous months had contributed significantly to the low inflation figures.",
        "However in contrast to recent months when the shekel had strengthened against the dollar, the shekel/dollar exchange rate at the time of the discussion was similar to the rate at the time of the previous month's interest rate discussion.",
        "The data on real activity continue to indicate that the economy is still enjoying a high rate of growth.",
        "Assessments presented in the discussion pointed to growth of 5.0 percent in 2006 and a similar rate in 2007.",
        "The rate of unemployment stabilized in recent months and stands at 8.3 percent.",
        "No inflationary pressures from the labor market are evident at this stage, and the real wage has edged up by only a moderate amount, lower than the rise in productivity such that unit labor costs remain on the downward trend of the past two years.",
        "All the participants favored a reduction of 25 basis points in the interest rate for February.",
        "Referring to the factors allowing a reduction in interest rate for February, in addition to the starting point of inflation being lower than the target, the further drop in Israel's country risk premium was noted.",
        "This reduction in risk premium, together with the current-account surplus and the foreign investment in the economy, constitute a factor acting to strengthen the shekel.",
        "Furthermore, the responsible budget policy was also noted as a factor that reduced inflationary pressures, as the low budget deficits reduce the (net) pressure of government demand for funds in the economy.",
        "In considering forces that could tend to increase inflation, participants focused on the rapid growth rate of the economy and the associated narrowing of the output gap.",
        "These act over time to increase pressure on prices, and it was noted that there were already indicators reflecting this pressure on domestic prices.",
        "However, recent data show no inflationary pressures from rising unit labor costs.",
        "It was also noted that a reduction in the interest rate for February would add to the cumulative interest rate reduction of 1 percentage point in the three months prior to this decision.",
        "After a cut in the interest rate of 25 basis points for February, the Bank of Israel interest rate would be 1 percentage point below the US Federal Reserve rate, and this at a time when the indications from most leading central banks worldwide are for a rise in short-term interest rates.",
        "Some participants noted that after a 25 basis point reduction in the interest rate for February, they thought it likely that the process of interest rate reductions would be coming to a close.",
        "Most of the participants were of the opinion that it was preferable at this stage to give no indication regarding interest rate decisions for the coming months.",
        "In conclusion, in light of the highly favorable background conditions, in terms of falling country risk premium, levels of current-account surplus in the balance of payments, and the inflow of foreign investment into Israel, the departmental directors participating in the discussion considered a reduction in the interest rate of 25 basis points for February was consistent with achieving the inflation target for 2007.",
        "The participants emphasized the importance that the Bank of Israel attaches to the inflation target, and stressed that the reduction in this month's interest rate was a step intended to increase the probability that price rises return quickly to a rate consistent with the target inflation.",
        "All the departmental directors participating in the discussion recommended reducing the interest rate for February by 25 basis points, and after considering their recommendations, the Governor decided to reduce the interest rate by 25 basis points.",
        "The Bank of Israel interest rate for February will therefore be 4.25 percent.",
        "Before the Governor makes the monthly interest rate decision, discussions are held at two levels.",
        "The first discussion takes place in a broad forum, in which the relevant background economic conditions are presented, including real and monetary developments in Israel’s economy and developments in the global economy.",
        "Participants in this discussion include the Governor, the Deputy Governor, the directors of the various economic departments of the Bank (the Research, Monetary, Foreign Currency, and Foreign Exchange Activity departments) and economists from various departments who prepare and present the material for discussion.",
        "In the narrow forum, the directors of the economic departments present their recommendations regarding the interest rate, and following a discussion, the Governor makes his decision.",
        "Data on economic activity indicate the continuation of rapid growth.",
        "This data include the National Accounts figures published in February, the composite state-of-theeconomy index, foreign trade data, tax revenues, and discussions with members of the business and financial communities.",
        "National Accounts data show that the growth rate in the last quarter of 2006 was very high: GDP surged by 8 percent, and business sector product by 12.8 percent.",
        "These figures demonstrate the economy’s rapid recovery after the war in the north in the third quarter of 2006.",
        "Housing investment rose by a healthy 18.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006, and it appears that the recovery in the construction industry is becoming more firmly based.",
        "Investors’ positive assessments of the state of the economy are reflected by the 7.6 percent increase in investment in the principal industries in 2006.",
        "The National Accounts data from 2006 also highlight the 8.9 percent increase in exports (excluding diamonds).",
        "Private consumption rose by 4.8 percent in 2006.",
        "Another indicator of the rapid expansion of economic activity is provided by the stateof-the-economy index, which was 0.9 percent higher in January 2007 than in December 2006.",
        "The indices for November and December 2006 were adjusted upwards by one-tenth of a percentage point each, to 0.5 percent and 0.7 percent respectively.",
        "The rise in the index reflects an acceleration in activity compared with previous months.",
        "The index of manufacturing production rose by about 9 percent (in annual terms) in the months October to December 2006, and the total sales revenue index rose by about 11 percent in the same period.",
        "Foreign trade data also indicate the continued expansion of economic activity.",
        "Receipts for goods exports, excluding diamonds, were 8.6 percent higher in January good imports (excluding diamonds) were 3.5 percent higher in January than in December.",

        "The rate of unemployment was 8.3 percent of the civilian labor force in November.",
        "This followed a drop from 8.8 percent in the second quarter of 2006 to 8.3 percent in the third quarter.",
        "The nominal wage per employee post in the business sector was about 4 percent higher in January–October 2006 than in the equivalent period in 2005.",
        "According to the employers' survey of the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Labor for the fourth quarter of 2006, the time required to recruit new employees rose.",
        "This was apparently affected by the low unemployment rate among those with a high level of education; that rate has now reached the low levels of the mid-1990s.",
        "Negotiations are currently in process on public sector wage agreements covering the period from July 2005 onwards.",
        "Total government activity in January (excluding credit granted) resulted in a budgetary surplus of about NIS 4.3 billion.",
        "This reflected tax revenues exceeding and expenditure falling short of their seasonal paths.",
        "Tax revenues in January were 7.1 percent higher, in real terms, than in January 2006.",
        "Government expenditure in January (excluding credit granted) was NIS 0.3 billion lower than the level consistent with the budget proposal.",
        "The privatization of the Oil Refineries (“Bazan”) will contribute to the continued reduction of the public-debt/GDP ratio in 2007.",
        "The Consumer Price Index (CPI) declined by 0.1 percent in January.",
        "This was in line with forecasters’ predictions, and it is in the upper part of the seasonal path that is consistent with the inflation target.",
        "Adjusting for the seasonal factors, the index rose by 0.3 percent.",
        "In the previous twelve months the CPI has risen by 0.1 percent, so that the 12month retrospective inflation rate was below the target.",
        "The sharp drop in inflation in the last year occurred against the background of the strengthening of the shekel against the dollar.",
        "If the components of the CPI are divided into those directly affected by the exchange rate and the price-of-energy component (“imported” items), on the one hand, and “domestic” components not affected by them, on the other, a marked difference between the paths followed by the two groups is evident.",
        "The prices of the domestic components of the index rose in 2006 by more than 2 percent, while prices of the imported components of the index fell.",
        "Initial estimates regarding the first quarter of 2007 suggest that prices of the domestic components continued to rise, and of the imported elements continued to fall.",
        "Inflation expectations to one year ahead derived from the capital market––break-even inflation––rose in February to about 1.4 percent, after standing at about 1 percent in January, and 1.3 percent in December.",
        "Some of the reduction in January may have been due to technical factors.",
        "From January to September 2006 these expectations were close to the midpoint of the inflation target range, and since October they have been below the midpoint.",
        "Israeli forecasters’ assessments of one-year inflation are close to the midpoint of the target range, and this month the average of their forecasts is 1.8 percent.",

        "The fact that stronger growth was becoming evident in the construction industry after a long period of stagnation, was taken as another indication of increased demand.",
        "Those recommending no change in the interest rate observed that a persistently rapid rate of growth was likely to lead to a situation in which economic growth would exceed the rise in production inputs (labor and capital) plus the expected rise in productivity, so that inflationary pressures were likely to emerge during the year.",

        "It was also noted that a 25 basis points cut in the interest rate for March, taken with the cumulative reductions made since November 2006, would bring the cumulative reduction since then to 1.5 percentage points, and would make the Bank of Israel’s rate 1.25 percentage points lower than the Fed rate.",
        "Other participants in the discussion favored a reduction of 25 basis points in the interest rate for March.",

        "These participants noted that as yet there were no evident signs of inflationary pressures on the price indices, not even on the indices of domestic prices (such as GDP prices) published by the Central Bureau of Statistics.",
        "The participants who favored cutting the interest rate for March argued that the proposed reduction was intended to increase the chances of a more rapid return to a rate of inflation consistent with the target.",
        "After considering the alternative recommendations, the Governor decided to reduce the interest rate for March by 25 basis points, to 4 percent, mainly to strengthen the probability that the inflation rate would return to within the target range by the end of the year.",
        "Before the Governor makes the monthly interest rate decision, discussions are held at two levels.",
        "The first discussion takes place in a broad forum, in which the relevant background economic conditions are presented, including real and monetary developments in Israel’s economy and developments in the global economy.",

        "According to one of the models, even if the shekel stops strengthening in the forex market and the exchange rate settles down at around NIS 4 to the dollar, the rise in the domestic process component (which is not directly affected by the exchange rate or prices abroad) will bring inflation to within the target range in the first quarter of 2008.",
        "The interest rate required to attain the inflation target depends to a considerable degree on future exchange rate developments.",

        "This general overview of developments in the capital markets revealed no clear anomalies in this behavior, though the Bank of Israel continues to monitor all indicators of financial stability in order to assess developments in the financial markets and see how they are operating, particularly in light of the current relatively low interest rates.",

        "These directors noted that cutting the interest rate at this time could mean a sharper change in the interest rate at a later date, and therefore it would be better to wait and not lower the interest rate for now.",
        "They argued that it would be better not to change the interest rate for June also in consideration of the need to support financial stability.",

        "These department directors noted that the recommended size of the interest rate reduction this month takes into consideration the rapid growth in the economy and the Bank's objective of supporting financial stability.",
        "They based their recommendation on the following considerations: - The reduction in the interest rate this month is intended to raise the probability of inflation gradually returning to within the target range in the first months of economy (and the continued closing of the output gap) would constitute a factor in gradually bringing inflation back to within the target range.",
        "Inflation registered in the local component––the component that is not directly affected by developments in the exchange rate or prices abroad––indicates the force of demand in the economy acting on inflation.",
        "These forces, though, were currently being offset by the strengthening of the shekel, and are not being felt in either actual inflation or inflation expectations.",
        "- The assessment is that the current account surplus in the balance of payments will continue close to its current level over the remainder of 2007.",
        "The current account surplus tends to increase the value of the shekel in the foreign exchange market, and hence supports a lower interest rate.",
        "However it was noted that the change in the NIS/$ exchange rate is affected both by local factors and by the weakening of the dollar worldwide, and that these trends could change.",

        "In light of the need to balance these considerations––the inflation rate significantly below target, but with local prices rising more rapidly than the overall target rate of inflation, and the need to support financial stability––the Governor decided to reduce the interest rate for June by 25 basis points, to 3.5 percent.",
        "The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor economic developments closely with the intention of achieving the price-stability target.",
        "Subject to this, the Bank will continue to support the attainment of a range of objectives of macroeconomic policy, in particular the encouragement of employment and growth.",

        "The investment houses expect on average similar developments.",
        "There remains an upside risk to this forecast mainly due to the background of a recently registered increase in the utilization of production capacity, the positive momentum in the labor market and the wage pressures expected as a result, as well as the continued rapid growth in the quantity of money and credit in the private sector.",

        "The fact that the rise in labor productivity has halted is another indication that the surplus production capacity in the economy has been fully exploited.",

        "The rapid increase in M1 was partly due to the public's switching from term deposits to current accounts in light of the low level of interest on the term deposits.",
        "Various scenarios of the development of inflation and other variables in the next year were examined using the Bank of Israel’s econometric models.",
        "As in the previous month, the underlying assumptions were that real economic activity would decline in Israel macroeconomic forecast, that interest rates around the world would rise gradually, starting in 2010, that world trade would slump in 2009 and increase slowly in 2010, and that prices of imported inputs, which started increasing in the second quarter of 2009, would continue to increase.",
        "In the baseline scenario of the quarterly DSGE (dynamic stochastic general equilibrium) model, inflation measured over the previous twelve months is expected to remain above the upper limit of the inflation target range until the middle of 2010, due to the transitory effect of the increases in taxes and water prices by the government.",

        "According to this model, the increase in the interest rate during the year will be a modest one.",
        "An alternative scenario was examined, in which world trade recovers more rapidly, and thus interest rates increase faster and inflation around the world is higher.",
        "Under those assumptions inflation in the next four quarters would be 2.1 percent (compared with 1.3 percent in the first scenario above).",
        "An alternative model that gives greater weight to the inertia in the inflation process yields a higher rate of inflation in the next four quarters, 2.3 percent, even without an accelerated recovery in world trade; the reason is the higher initial (i.e., current) rate of inflation.",
        "According to this model, inflation will moderate only from 2011.",
        "All the models yielded an increase in the Bank of Israel interest rate.",
        "The basic DSGE model, however, gave only a moderate increase in the interest rate in the next year, while the DSGE model with the assumption of a rapid global recovery and the alternative model gave a rising interest rate path similar to that derived from the slope of the makam yield curve.",

        "Nevertheless, they noted that activity was still at a low level, that the output gap was expected to continue widening, and that unemployment was expected to increase in the next few months.",
        "In addition, there is great uncertainty with regard to the extent to which the recovery would endure.",
        "Specifically, the participants voiced concern that the US economy, which greatly influences Israel's exports, would recover more slowly than the currently prevailing market assessments.",
        "The participants noted that inflation in the previous twelve months was above the upper limit of the target range despite the low level of real activity.",
        "They added, however, that a significant part of the deviation from the target was the result of nonrecurring factors (the increase in the VAT rate, the tax on cigarettes, and the water surcharge), but even excluding those factors, the rate of inflation in the last few months was close to the upper limit of the range.",
        "In that context there was discussion of the degree of persistence of the rise in the inflation rate.",
        "The participants argued that as some of the increased rate of inflation was due to one-off factors, its degree of persistence is expected to be low.",
        "In addition, the existence of the output gap and the relatively high rate of unemployment will act to moderate inflationary pressures.",
        "They also noted that since the middle of August, twelve-month-forward inflation expectations derived from the capital market have fallen considerably, to the midpoint of the inflation target range, but this was based on the assumption that the Bank of Israel interest rate will be increased in the next few months.",

        "He emphasized that this was not necessarily the start of an upward trend in the interest rate, but was a necessary adjustment to its level.",
        "The three members who recommended the smaller increase, of a quarter of a percentage point, emphasized the uncertainty surrounding the transition to positive growth, and the fact that in any case the growth rate was modest and the level of activity low.",
        "Moreover, an interest rate of 0.75 percent still expressed an expansionary monetary policy, which is still needed at this time.",

        "Nevertheless, it is thought that the reduction in twelve-month inflation expectations is due not only to the continued widening of the output gap, but also to expectations that the Bank of Israel will increase the interest rate in the next few months.",

        "The data that came as a positive surprise in April were those relating to housing: house sales increased, as did the number of mortgage confirmations, and the confidence index of the US construction industry.",
        "One of the main reasons for this partial recovery was the interest rate on mortgages that dropped to unprecedentedly low levels following the start of implementation of the program to buy $1.1 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and agency debt.",
        "That said, the stock of houses for sale continues to increase, as did the rate of foreclosures, and the number of building starts published in April indicated a decline.",
        "The labor market continued to show serious deterioration: payroll employment is falling (since the outbreak of the crisis the US economy has lost about 5.1 million jobs) and the unemployment rate has increased to 8.5 percent.",
        "The enormous scale of the support programs are expected to help the economy at least in the short term, but the budget deficit is expected to climb to about 12 percent of GDP.",
        "The large amount of credit flowing into the economy is likely to cause inflation in the future, and this month references were made to an exit strategy for moving away from monetary expansion.",

        "The existence of the output gap, reflecting in part a higher than full-employment rate of unemployment, is expected to continue to moderate inflation over the next year.",
        "The participants observed that economic activity continued along its recovery path in the third quarter.",
        "They noted, however, that despite the further recovery of activity and the expectation of faster growth in Israel and world wide, there was uncertainty about the strength of the process.",
        "The three members who recommended an increase in the interest rate explained that the highly expansionary monetary policy was adopted against the background of a deep crisis and concern that the global recession would be severe and longlasting.",
        "In light of the current economic activity and inflation environment, it was appropriate to increase the interest rate for December.",

        "Nonetheless, growth is expected to continue to be unstable, against the background of the weakness in the services and construction sectors, and in light of the non-uniform growth in the different member countries, with the Northern European economies (Germany, France and the Netherlands) recovering faster than the Southern ones (Spain and Greece still experiencing recessions).",

        "Looking to the future, the participants in the discussion favored a pro-growth expansionary monetary policy which would return the inflation rate to around the midpoint of the price stability target range over the coming year.",
        "An increase in the interest rate this month would be part of a gradual process of returning the interest rate to a \"normal\" level, the path of which would be determined in accordance with the degree of firmness of growth, both global and in Israel, the rate at which the major central banks increase their interest rates, and the inflation environment.",
        "After considering all the points raised in the discussion, the Governor decided to increase the interest rate for January by a quarter of a percentage point, to 1.25 percent.",
        "In its announcement of the decision, the Bank of Israel stressed the following: - Inflation measured over the previous twelve months was 3.8 percent, and in the next few months is expected to be above the upper limit of the target inflation range.",
        "Although this high inflation is to a considerable extent the result of increases in taxes and government controlled prices, one-year-forward inflation expectations are in the upper part of the target range.",

        "Manufacturing industry continues to recover, as reflected by orders from factories and utilization of manufacturing capacity.",
        "Government aid in the housing sphere was reflected by a reduction in the mortgage interest rate to the low level of 4.3 percent via its purchase of mortgagebacked securities (MBS), by a reduction in the number of foreclosures by means of encouragement to the banks to change the terms of the mortgage to about 650,000 borrowers, and mainly by the program to support first-time home buyers (which was previously extended to relatively poor home-renovators), which increased the number of new home-buyers by about 20 percent.",
        "Nevertheless, according to the real estate data company First American CoreLogic, there are still about 10.7 million householders the value of whose mortgages exceeds the value of their houses.",

        "Europe attracted much attention in December against the background of the lowering of the ratings and rating outlooks of Spain and Portugal.",
        "Although there does not seem to be really serious concern over the possibility of Greece (or any member of the EU) becoming bankrupt, Greece's yield curve rose by 1–1.5 percent, and its CDS spreads widened by about 150 basis points.",

        "In its forecast relating to Japan's economy, the Economist quotes that the most realistic path facing Japan is a sustained decay.",
        "The strengthening of the yen which made a great indent in Japan's exports and resulted in a slump in capital investment, and the assessment that the yen would remain strong for the next few years (according to the IMF) led to a declaration by the Minister of Finance that the government must act against non-normative currency changes, and should convene an emergency meeting on the subject.",
        "The markets, however, which had expected significant measures, were disappointed that such measures to change the situation were not included among the steps decided upon.",

        "All the members of management participating in the narrow-forum discussion expressed the view that in light of the deterioration in the economic situation, an expansionary monetary policy was required.",
        "This, given the forecasters' assessments, on average, that inflation in 2009 (measured over the previous twelve months) was likely to be below the inflation target, and one-year-forward inflation expectations inflation target range.",
        "Inflation is expected to return to within the target range in 2010.",
        "In the narrow-forum discussion, five members of management make recommendations to the Governor regarding the appropriate rate of interest for the economy.",
        "Four of them recommended reducing the rate by 0.25 percentage points, and the other member recommended a reduction of half a percentage point.",
        "The latter argued that it was important to make such a reduction in order to boost growth, among other things by weakening the shekel against other currencies, and that the risks involved in such a cut were not serious.",
        "The four participants recommending a cut of one-quarter of a percentage point argued that a reduction in the interest rate should be made in order to encourage economic activity and to improve liquidity in the financial markets, but they were of the opinion that at this stage a larger reduction was not appropriate.",
        "They stated that at current low interest rates, and at this stage of the economic cycle, it is not clear to what extent further cuts in the interest rate would affect the cost of credit to firms and households, and that the effectiveness of further cuts had to be examined.",
        "They explained that as the banks are maintaining the spread between the average interest they charge borrowers on credit granted and the interest they pay depositors (which is lower than the Bank of Israel's published rate), the situation has arisen in which despite the fact that the Bank of Israel's interest rate is still positive, the interest the banks pay depositors is close to zero, and they have little room to reduce it further.",
        "In this situation, in order to preserve the interest rate spread (also known as banking spread), the transmission mechanism from a reduction in the Bank of Israel interest rate and the rate charged to borrowers is weakened.",
        "Moreover, in Israel and around the world questions arise regarding the functioning of the financial system when interest paid to depositors is close to zero.",
        "In these circumstances, there could be a switch from time deposits to current-account deposits, which would make it more difficult for banks to manage liquidity and to balance deposits and loans to different terms.",
        "The public may also switch from bank deposits into other assets, that could create an undesirable increase in risk for savers in the financial system.",
        "In the course of the discussion it was noted that when the interest rate is at an unprecedentedly low level, the Bank should focus on other instruments to bring about monetary expansion.",
        "As was announced, on February 17 the Bank started buying government bonds on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange.",
        "Such purchases of medium- and long-term bonds on the secondary market directly supports the lowering of interest in the economy also for longer terms, thereby helping to support economic activity.",
        "Another point made in the discussion was that if necessary the Bank would also consider activating other instruments in its arsenal (such as those used by other central banks) to increase liquidity in the financial system, as part of the policy of credit easing or quantitative easing.",
        "With regard to the decision on the interest rate for March, with the intention of reducing the cost of credit and strengthening the economy's ability to handle the effects of the decline in demand, and given the assessments that a cut in the interest rate was consistent with the rapid reduction in inflation and that inflation was likely to drop below the target range in 2009, the Governor decided to reduce the interest rate for March by 25 basis points to 0.75 percent.",
        "It was also decided to narrow the interest rate corridor in the credit window and the commercial banks' deposit window from The Bank stressed the following points supporting the reduction in the interest rate for March: - The marked effects of the global crisis and the fall in domestic demand on economic activity in Israel; - The Bank’s assessment that inflation is on a steep downward path, and is likely to be below the target range in the second half of 2009; - The low interest rates set by the major central banks around the world, and the additional policy instruments used by them to bring about monetary expansion.",
        "The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor worldwide economic developments and the situation in Israel closely, and will act to encourage employment and growth and to support the stability of the financial system, and to achieve price stability.",

        "The January Employment Report showed a rise in unemployment to 7.6 percent, its highest level since 1992, and it is expected to continue to rise even higher.",
        "The number of jobs lost in January, at 598,000, was the largest drop in employment in one month since 1974.",
        "The weakness in the labor market emphasizes the need for a comprehensive support plan, and indeed the US is activating several programs: a program for fiscal expansion, a program to rescue the banks, a program to rescue the car industry, and a program to save the mortgage and real estate industry.",
        "This month the fiscal stimulus program, amounting to $787 billion, was approved.",
        "Its main points are tax cuts and infrastructure investment.",
        "The administration's plan to rescue the banks focuses on removing problem assets from the banks' balance sheets.",
        "Nonetheless, there is still much uncertainty about the way the programs will be implemented and their effects.",
        "Against this background the investment houses significantly reduced their growth forecasts, and on average they expect negative growth in the first half of 2009, and the beginning of a recovery and a switch to positive growth in the third quarter of the year.",
        "On average they predict negative growth of 1.9 percent in 2009 as a whole.",
        "The IMF also adjusted its forecast of US growth downward, to a negative 1.6 percent in At the same time, inflation is declining, in light of the intensification of the recession, the decline in the labor market, and falling commodity and oil prices.",
        "Moreover, the risk of deflation is increasing.",
        "The European economy contracted in the fourth quarter of 2008, the third quarter in succession.",
        "The slowdown in growth was widespread, with marked contraction of growth in Germany, France, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands and Portugal, and it resulted from the steep decline in exports and investment, as well as the weakness of consumer demand.",
        "In the UK too the recession deepened.",
        "Growth forecasts for the eurozone continued to fall, in light of the more severe weakness in both the global and the European environment.",

        "On average, the investment houses expect negative growth of 4.1 percent over the whole of 2009, and positive growth of 0.5 percent in 2010.",
        "The IMF also revised its forecasts downwards, to negative growth of 2.6 percent in Japan's economy in 2009, and positive growth of 0.6 percent in 2010.",
        "The dive in demand, surplus manufacturing capacity, appreciation of the yen, and the fall in commodity prices add their weight to the deflationary pressures, and give rise to concern over a renewed deflationary spiral.",
        "On average, the investment houses expect deflation in 2009.",
        "The rate of growth of the emerging markets slowed considerably, due largely to the weakness of global demand and world trade, and the significant tightening of financing conditions, in particular for economies with large current account deficits.",
        "In addition, the currencies of emerging market countries weakened, adding to the pressure on businesses and households, and hence, on the banks.",
        "The IMF expects a sharp slowdown in growth in the emerging markets, from 6.25 percent in 2008 to 3.25 in 2009.",
        "One of the most serious problems is the continuing shortening of credit lines to private borrowers in the emerging markets.",
        "Whereas the primary markets for investment grade bonds in the US and Europe reverted to limited activity, in the emerging markets only high-grade government (or government-guaranteed) bonds and high-grade corporate bonds reflected some revival in activity, with only a few new issues.",

        "The rise in the latest index continues the upward trend that started in May 2009.",
        "That said, the adjustments to some of the components of previous months' indices were more significant than adjustments in the past, thus increasing the uncertainty about the information conveyed by the monthly index.",

        "Moreover, the output gap, reflected by the high rate of unemployment, among other things, was expected to restrain inflation in the coming year.",
        "The point was added that the monetary environment that affects inflation incorporates both the interest rate and the exchange rate, and the strengthening of the shekel (the appreciation of the nominal effective exchange rate over the last five months) serves to moderate inflation.",
        "At the end of the discussion, taking all the above points into consideration, the Governor decided to leave the interest rate for October unchanged at 0.75 percent, in order to balance the need to continue to support the recovery of economic activity with the need to return inflation to within the price stability target range, while preserving financial stability.",
        "In its announcement of the decision, the Bank of Israel stressed the following: - Inflation measured over the previous twelve months is slightly above the target range.",

        "CDS spreads around the world followed a similar trend of contraction, including those of the peripheral European countries In the month between the previous interest rate discussions and the current ones, growth figures for the first quarter of 2010 became available that indicated that the global recovery was continuing and that it had even accelerated compared with the rate in the previous quarter.",
        "However, for many advanced economies data relating to the second quarter point to a slowdown in the rate of expansion in the global economy.",
        "Investment houses around the world expect the global rate of growth to slow in the second half of 2010, against the background of the ending of the positive effects of the fiscal aid programs and continuing monetary expansion in some countries, and against the background of the expected slowdown in growth in Europe.",
        "Many forecasters in investment houses around the world this month reduced their growth forecasts for 2011, in particular for Europe.",
        "At the same time, the weakness of the euro against most currencies is expected to help Europe's economy.",
        "There is considerable concern among investors regarding countries with high public debt and/or large budget deficits, and in several European countries, including the UK, the authorities announced fiscal measures to reduce their budget deficits.",

        "In the narrow-forum discussion, four members of management make recommendations to the Governor regarding the appropriate rate of interest for the economy.",
        "In the discussions on the interest rate for July, all the participating members of management recommended that the Governor hold the rate unchanged at 1.5 percent.",
        "As stated in the reports of previous interest rate discussions, the Bank of Israel's policy is to continue with the gradual process of bringing the interest rate back to a more \"normal\" level intended to position inflation firmly within the target range, and to contribute to the further recovery of economic activity, while supporting financial stability.",
        "The path of the interest rate will be determined in accordance with the inflation environment, the entrenchment of growth in Israel and globally, the rate at which the major central banks increase their interest rates, and in light of developments in the exchange rates of the shekel.",

        "In the discussion, participants noted that according to the Bank of Israel assessments and those of the private forecasters, inflation measured over the previous twelve months will continue to decline, and in the next few months it will be around the midpoint of the target inflation range or even below it.",
        "It was noted that in the basic scenario of the Research Department assessment, which combines discretionary assessments and the results of several models, inflation a year hence is expected to be close to the midpoint of the target inflation range.",
        "The assessments of the private forecasters and inflation expectations derived from the capital market are that inflation in a year's time will be in the upper part of the inflation target range.",
        "The range of expectations, given the current data, is that the Bank of Israel's interest rate will increase by between 1 and 1.5 percentage points in the next twelve months.",
        "It was noted in the discussion that inflation expectations one year forward calculated from the capital market increased in June (average for the month) and were close to the upper limit of the target range.",
        "Some of the participants interpreted this as a rise in expected inflation, while others stressed the possibility that technical factors unrelated to changes in inflation expectations a year ahead had affected CPI-indexed bond prices (according to this view, a drop in the supply of short-term CPI-indexed government bonds caused a liquidity problem in the CPI-indexed bond market, and led to a decline in the yield on these bonds relative to the yield on unindexed bonds with a one-year horizon).",
        "Data published since the previous interest rate discussions indicate that the expansion in real economic activity in Israel is continuing, with increased uncertainty regarding the continuation of the rapid rate of growth.",
        "Participants noted in particular the greater uncertainty regarding exports in light of global developments and their implications for Israel's economy.",
        "In addition, the weakness of the euro against the shekel reduces the profitability of Israel's exports to the eurozone and makes it more difficult for Israeli exporters to compete with European competitors.",
        "The timing of increases in the interest rate in Israel relative to those in the leading economies affects the shekel exchange rate.",
        "Participants in the discussion noted that as a result of economic data from around the world published recently and concern over the debt crises in several European countries, the timing of increases in interest rates in Europe and most advanced economies will be delayed, and increases in their interest rates are not expected before the end of 2010.",
        "Taking into consideration the various points made in the discussion, the Governor decided to keep the interest rate for July unchanged at 1.5 percent.",
        "In its announcement of the decision, the Bank of Israel stressed the following conditions that led to the decision to leave the interest rate unchanged for July: - The inflation environment: inflation measured over the previous twelve months is falling, and is expected to continue to do so, and in the next few months is expected to be close to the midpoint of the target range or even below it.",
        "Inflation expectations, both of forecasters and those calculated from the capital market, are that in another year the inflation rate will return to the upper part of the inflation target range, with a cumulative interest-rate increase of between 1 and 1.5 percentage points in the next twelve months.",
        "- Uncertainty regarding the continuation of rapid growth has increased.",
        "Global economic developments, mainly those in Europe, are likely to have a negative impact on Israel's growth, and in particular on Israel's exports.",
        "- Interest rates of the central banks of the leading advanced economies are very low, and are expected to remain so longer than originally anticipated.",
        "In addition, the ECB has reintroduced some of the special instruments of monetary accommodation.",

        "The first manufacturing surveys published for May, however, including the Empire State Manufacturing Survey of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and those of the Federal Reserve Banks of Philadelphia and Richmond, indicate signs of a slowdown.",
        "In addition, the New York Fed's survey notes that in May the level of optimism regarding future business conditions declined, and the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index showed a slowdown in business activity in May.",
        "Moreover, the level of activity remained below the pre-crisis levels, and reflect a slower recovery in consumer and business spending than had been expected.",
        "Concern over the risks facing the US economy because of the European debt crisis and its implications also cast a cloud over the recovery.",
        "The planned fiscal cuts in countries in the eurozone are expected to have a negative impact on US exports to Europe, and the strengthening of the dollar against the euro too is expected to have a negative effect on US exports to Europe and to the rest of the world.",
        "Moreover, the growth is not creating a real increase in employment, and the economy is still confronted by a weak labor market.",
        "The number of claims for unemployment benefit remains high, and the rate of utilization of production capacity increased to The weakness in the housing market also persists, and continues to keep growth down.",
        "The latest housing market data show a sharp drop in activity following the ending of the tax benefit for first-time house buyers, indicating that the market is still dependent on government support.",
        "Thus, the number of building starts fell in May.",
        "The number of mortgage applications also declined.",
        "Against the background of the weakness in the labor market, the low level of utilization of production capacity, the slow recovery of consumer spending and the high level of stocks in the housing market, inflation indices remain low, and the risk of deflation is higher than the risk of inflation.",
        "The CPI continued to decline and dropped by 0.2 percent in May, following a fall in fuel prices.",

        "On the one hand, the sharp depreciation of the euro against most other currencies is expected to help Europe's exports.",
        "On the other hand, the consumer confidence index remains low in light of rising unemployment and the persistent fiscal crisis.",
        "Growing uncertainty over the debt crisis, the stability of the European banking system and the possible effects of the budget cuts introduced in most countries continue to cast a shadow over the European economy.",
        "The reduction in Greece's credit rating by Moody's, who reduced Greek bonds to the Ba1 junk rating (Ba1) following the downgrading by Fitch and S&P, and Germany's announcement prohibiting selling financial assets short, similar to the announcement by the new government in Hungary that the fiscal situation was more serious than reported previously, added to the uncertainty and concern.",
        "The reduction of Spain's debt rating by Fitch from AAA to AA+ and the announcement of the nationalization of a small regional bank in Spain while four regional banks had to merge caused concern that the crisis in Spain's banking system was becoming more severe, and led to apprehension of contagion affecting other European countries.",
        "Rumors that Spain would receive support from the EU and the IMF caused a steep jump in yields on Spanish government bonds, but following the successful bond issue by the Spanish government the yields fell again, with the government managing to raise €3.5 billion with a yield of 4.86 percent, lower than the market yield prior to the issue.",
        "Many governments reacted by announcing programs of cuts and reforms, including Italy, Spain, France, Germany, Greece and Switzerland.",
        "The UK also announced deep budget cuts that incorporated reduced expenditure, increased taxes and surcharges on banks, in an attempt to reduce the large budget deficit.",
        "In addition, to calm the markets the Spanish government announced that it would publish the results of banks' stress tests (measuring banks' resilience), which was followed by a German government announcement that it would also publish stress test results on the German banks by the end of July.",

        "With regard to possible effects on Israel's economy, the share of Israel's exports to European countries under market pressure is relatively small (about 5 percent of exports), but there was nevertheless increased concern that if the crisis were to spread to the whole of the EU, which constitutes an important market for Israel's exports (28 percent of exports), it could have a significant impact on Israel's exports.",

        "Economic developments in the US, Japan, and the large eurozone countries continue to indicate that the exit from the crisis is proceeding and that they are returning to economic growth.",
        "Among the advanced economies, the recovery in the US is stronger than that in Japan and much stronger than that in Europe.",
        "Global growth is spearheaded by China and India.",
        "Expectations regarding interest rates around the world derived from the conduct of financial market traders are that the increases in interest rates by the central banks in most advanced economies will start later than expected last month.",
        "The Fed is expected to increase its interest rate in the second half of the year, and the ECB is expected to increase its rate after the Fed.",
        "As stated, the ECB reintroduced several special policy measures in order to conduct a more accommodative monetary policy.",
        "In the narrow-forum discussion, four members of management make recommendations to the Governor regarding the appropriate rate of interest for the economy.",
        "In the discussions on the interest rate for June, all the participating members of management recommended that the Governor hold the rate unchanged at 1.5 percent.",
        "As was stated in the report of the previous interest rate discussions, the Bank of Israel's policy is to continue with the gradual process of bringing the interest rate back to a more \"normal\" level that reflects the recovery in economic activity, and that is required to place inflation firmly in the target inflation range.",
        "The gradual nature of the process is expressed by the fact that the Bank does not change the interest rate every month, but only in light of the inflation environment, expectations of growth in the global economy, and the interest rates of the major central banks, while taking into consideration the exchange rate of the shekel.",
        "In the discussion, participants noted that data that became available in the month since the previous interest rate discussions indicate that real activity is continuing to expand, with some indications that the rate of expansion has slowed somewhat.",
        "Participants referred particularly to the increase in uncertainty regarding global developments and their implications for Israel's economy.",
        "The greater uncertainty resulted from the outbreak of the debt crisis in Greece and fears that it would spread to other countries in Europe.",
        "Participants discussed the various channels via which the debt problem in several European countries affects the global environment: the exposure of banks around the world to countries facing debt difficulties, the liquidity problem in European financial markets, the essential fiscal consolidation in several European countries that is likely to reduce demand in the short term, and the decline of demand in Europe due to the weakness of the euro.",
        "As far as Israel's economy is concerned, it was noted that Israel's exports to European countries with debt problems are relatively modest, but if the crisis should spread and become more severe it could reduce Europe's demand for Israel's exports.",
        "Furthermore, the weakness of the euro against the shekel makes Israel's exports to Europe less profitable and has an adverse impact on exporters' competitiveness vis-àvis European competitors.",
        "Participants in the discussion observed that the econometric models used by the Bank indicate that inflation (over the previous twelve months) is expected to be below the midpoint of the target inflation range in 2010, and is expected to remain within the target range over the course of the next twelve months.",
        "This assessment, consistent with those of the private Israeli forecasters, also shows the interest rate increasing in the next year.",
        "One-year forward inflation expectations derived from the capital market remained at the same level as in the previous month, in the upper part of the inflation target range.",
        "The reductions in commodity prices, and oil prices in particular, (in the month since the previous interest rate discussions) are expected to moderate the inflation environment.",
        "The timing of increases in the interest rate in Israel relative to those in the leading economies round the world affects the shekel exchange rate.",
        "Participants in the discussion noted that as a result of concern over the debt crises in several European countries, the increases in interest rates that were expected to take place in the next few months in Europe and most advanced economies will be delayed, and the ECB is not expected to increase its interest rate in the next half year.",
        "Special emphasis was placed in the discussion on the rapid increase in housing prices in the last year, with the Supervisor of Banks participating in the discussions of this issue.",
        "It was noted that housing prices, according to the house price survey, continued to increase at the beginning of 2010 following their rapid rise in 2009.",
        "Participants in the discussion were of the view that there was no \"bubble\" in the housing market, but in order to prevent undesirable developments in the future it was important to moderate the pressures for increases in housing prices.",
        "The point was made that house prices affect rentals, which are included in the CPI, so that house prices have an effect on the index.",
        "In addition, a continuation of recent rapid increases in housing prices would be likely to have a negative impact on the stability of the financial sector.",
        "Based in part on the analysis of the situation by the Banking Supervision Department, and in part on the discussion within the forum, which concluded that in light of the changing situation in the global economy, it would not be appropriate to raise the interest rate, participants recommended that macro-prudential tools be used concurrently with the announcement of the interest rate for June.",
        "In this context, to support financial stability, the Supervisor of Banks decided to publish draft guidelines––on the same day as the announcement of the June interest rate––for consultation with the banks, on the development of risks on housing loans, with a requirement for an additional provision for housing loans with a high loan-to-value ratio.",
        "Taking into consideration the various points made in the discussion, the Governor decided to keep the interest rate for June unchanged at 1.5 percent, and the Supervisor of Banks published a requirement for banks to make an additional provision for housing loans with high loan-to-value ratios.",
        "In its announcement of the decision, the Bank of Israel stressed the following background conditions that led to the decision to leave the interest rate unchanged for June: - The inflation environment: the CPI rose by 3 percent in the last twelve months, and over the last three months it was unchanged.",
        "Excluding the effect of indirecttax reductions and the removal of the water surcharge, inflation in the last twelve months was 2.6 percent.",
        "Inflation over the previous twelve months is expected to decline in the next few months, and the annual rate for the whole of 2010 is expected to be slightly below the midpoint of the range.",
        "One-year-forward inflation expectations derived from the capital market stood at 2.7 percent in May.",
        "The Israeli forecasters also expect, on average, that CPI inflation in the next twelve months will be 2.7 percent.",
        "These expectations and forecasts are accompanied by expectations of gradual increases in the Bank of Israel interest rate.",
        "- Data published this month, and in particular data on business sector product in the first quarter of 2010 and labor market data, continue to support the assessment that economic activity is on a rising trend, although there are signs of a slowing in the rate of increase in activity.",
        "There was growing concern that the debt crises in some European countries would cast a cloud over the recovery in the advanced economies, and would thus have a negative impact on economic activity in Israel.",
        "- Interest rates of the central banks of the leading advanced economies are very low, and are expected to remain so longer than originally anticipated.",
        "In addition, the ECB reintroduced some of the special instruments of monetary accommodation.",
        "- In light of the continued rapid increase in housing prices and the steep rise in housing credit, due partly to the low level of interest, and in order to moderate these trends and to support financial stability, the Supervisor of Banks issued draft guidelines for consultation with the banks regarding the development of risks on housing loans, and imposing additional provisions for housing loans with a high loan-to-value ratio.",
        "The Bank of Israel will continue to act to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system.",
        "Acting Head of the Monetary and Finance Division, Research Department Ms Irit Mendelson, Assistant Director of the Market Operations Department Mr Rony Hizkiyahu, the Supervisor of Banks International Affairs Division In the month since the previous interest rate discussions the data on the US economy continued to be positive.",
        "In the first quarter of 2010 GDP increased at an annual rate of 3.2 percent, compared with expectations of 3.3 percent.",
        "The composition of growth was encouraging: The private sector contributed 3.6 percentage points to the growth rate, while the public sector reduced it by 0.3 percentage points––an indication of the strength of the recovery in the private sector.",
        "The weakness of the public sector, however, points to a different problem, that whereas the government is taking significant expansionary fiscal measures to boost the economy, the local and municipal authorities are having to cut their budgets heavily, and this more than offsets the expansionary policy.",
        "The main change noted in the announcement of the Fed interest rate decision was the comment that the labor market had started to improve, and indeed the employment data were particularly encouraging.",
        "The number of employee posts increased more than expected, and the number of hours worked per post also increased.",
        "The Chairman of the Fed, in his address, stated that he expected that the banks would soon start lending to small businesses, due to the improvement in those businesses' situation.",
        "The CPI data for March and for the first quarter of 2010 were very low.",
        "As a result of the reductions in commodity and fuel prices and the strengthening of the dollar, no inflationary pressures are expected in the near future.",
        "The Fed Chairman's adherence to the expression promising \"exceptionally low levels of interest for a long time\" led to a delay in the timing of the expected path of increases in the interest rate in the US.",
        "The crisis in Greece, against the background of high budget deficits and public debt in several European countries, made it an urgent necessity to find a solution for Greece and dominated the difficult problems facing the eurozone.",
        "Solutions to the structural problems of some European countries would have been simpler to find if they had the possibility of devaluing their currencies and cutting their labor costs, or if the eurozone were subject to one uniform fiscal authority.",
        "Different commentators saw the crisis either as posing a threat of the break-up of the eurozone or as the opportunity to create fiscal uniformity.",
        "The main points of the rescue plan announced by the EU were the establishment of an extensive loans mechanism, intended for countries in difficulties, and the injection of liquidity by means of actions by the ECB.",
        "The President of the ECB stated that this was the most difficult crisis since the WW2, and stated that they needed a strong sense of direction.",
        "Despite everything, the European macroeconomic data published this month were generally good, with a positive surprise in the form of Germany's and Europe's GDPs, manufacturing production, orders from factories, and employment data, and even confidence indices (apparently dating prior to the increase in the severity of the crisis).",
        "However, it appears that these indications relate to the past, whereas Europe's economic future currently depends entirely on the success of the EU rescue plan.",
        "The new government declared an immediate program of cuts in budget expenditure.",
        "Manufacturing production came as a positive surprise with the sharpest increase for seven years, and various confidence indices continue to indicate expansion.",
        "The fact that the UK has an independent currency and an independent interest rate policy is likely to improve its competitive position and to support the economy.",
        "In its interest rate announcement, the Bank of England kept unchanged both its interest rate and its bond purchase program, and stated that the risks that could endanger growth had increased slightly, and that the Bank did not rule out the continued purchase of assets in the context of its quantitative easing.",
        "The data on Japan's economy were also encouraging.",
        "Production, consumption, construction activity, the various confidence indices and the composite indices all showed a continuation of the trend of improvement (and most were better that the forecasts), and there was even some improvement with regard to the deflation.",
        "The export sector in particular was notable, with a significant increase in sales, resulting from the improvement in world trade and the weakness of the yen in the previous months.",
        "The disappointing GDP figure for the first quarter, the reduced demand expected from Europe, together with the strengthening of the yen, all these are expected to have a negative impact on Japan's production and exports, and were among the factors that led to the Bank of Japan's announcement on the urgent need to broaden the basis of growth.",
        "The Bank of Japan increased its growth forecast from its January level, and now expects stronger growth than the long-term trend (particularly in 2011).",
        "However, it seems that there are risks to the realization of this forecast, especially the implications of the European debt crises, both via the drop in European demand and due to the unease expected to be felt by the markets with regard to countries with heavy debts.",
        "The macroeconomic data of the emerging market economies continue to be buoyant, particularly those of East Asia and Latin America.",
        "That said, however, the capital markets of the emerging markets were adversely affected by the European crisis as were the advanced economies, with the East European indices showing an even stronger negative impact.",
        "The main route of the contagion was the increased risk aversion and the growing dependence of the emerging markets on global growth and world trade, which are likely to suffer.",
        "Some East European countries, with Hungary at the top of the list, have a worrying debt profile, and are likely to be harmed by the increase in attention being paid to the subject of debt.",
        "Before the Governor makes the monthly interest rate decision,[1] discussions are held at two levels––the first in a broad forum, and the second in a narrower one.",
        "In the broad-forum discussion, the relevant background economic conditions are presented, including real, monetary and financial developments in Israel’s economy, and developments in the global economy.",
        "Participants in this discussion include the Governor, the Deputy Governor, the directors of the Research and Market Operations Departments of the Bank and economists from various departments who prepare and present the material for discussion.",
        "The data, estimates and assessments in these minutes are those that were available at the time of the discussions.",
        "In the narrow forum, the directors of the Research and Market Operations Departments and two other participating members of management present their recommendations regarding the interest rate and, following a discussion, the Governor makes his decision.",
        "Most indicators published in the last month (in the period between the decision on the interest rate on August 23 and the current decision on September 27), showed that economic activity continued to increase at a buoyant rate in the third quarter, so that the output gap contracted further.",
        "This is an extension of the positive developments in the first half of the year shown by the National Accounts data and the Labor Force Survey for that period.",
        "According to the Research Department's staff forecast, GDP is rate decisions will be made by the Committee.",

        "According to the National Accounts figures published on September 16, GDP grew by first quarter.",

        "In the second quarter, business sector product expanded rapidly, by 5.3 percent.",
        "Goods and services exports increased by percent increase in residential investment.",
        "Private consumption expanded by 9 percent, after remaining steady in the previous quarter, and imports continued to increase, with a 9.4 percent rise in the second quarter.",
        "The August composite state-of-the-economy index rose by 0.2 percent.",
        "The indices for the previous months were revised upwards slightly, giving a cumulative increase in the last three months of 0.9 percent, evidence of the continued expansion of economic activity.",
        "The increase in the index in August resulted from a 2.6 rise in the index of manufacturing production in July; a 2.1 percent rise in the trade and services revenue index in July; and a surge of 10.2 percent in the services exports index in August.",
        "These were partially offset by a drop in August of 8.1 percent in the consumer goods exports index, of 5 percent in the index of imports of consumer goods, and of 6 percent in the index of imports of production inputs, after these indices had risen in July.",
        "Preliminary data from the Bank of Israel Companies Survey for the third quarter indicated further expansion of economic activity in that quarter, at a rate similar to that in the first half of the year.",
        "The Labor Force Survey for the second quarter published at the end of August shows that the improvement in the labor market observed since the second half of 2009 continued.",
        "The rate of unemployment fell to 6.2 percent (from 7.0 percent in the previous quarter), the rate of participation in the labor market increased to 56.9 percent, and the rate of employment to 53.3 percent.",
        "While the number of employees increased, both in the economy as a whole and in the business sector, the number of hours worked per employee declined, so that total labor input increased only slightly in the second quarter.",
        "An industry-by-industry analysis of the number of employees shows that it increased in the business sector and in public administration and in almost all the principal industries, with the exception of a sharp drop in agriculture and moderate declines in education and in transport and communications.",
        "National Insurance data show that the nominal wage per employee post increased by percent increase in the first quarter.",
        "The real wage did not change in the second quarter, after rising by1.3 percent in the first.",

        "Goods imports (excluding ships, aircraft and diamonds) fell by 6.2 percent in August from their July level (in dollar terms, seasonally adjusted), but the average level in July–August was 1.9 percent higher than their average level in the second quarter.",
        "This reflects increases in imports of consumer goods and capital goods in July– August compared with their level in the second quarter, and a small decline in raw material imports.",
        "The domestic deficit in August was NIS 3.1 billion, NIS 0.3 billion in excess of the expected seasonal deficit.",
        "This deviation resulted from revenues NIS 0.4 billion lower than the seasonal path, and under-spending of NIS 0.1 billion.",
        "In the eight months from January to August 2010 the deficit totaled 1.5 percent of GDP, below the seasonal path, due to revenues 3.7 percent higher than in the budget forecast and expenditure 1.4 percent lower than the path consistent with complete expenditure of the budget.",
        "Based on developments to date and on the assumption of almost complete expenditure of the budget, the total deficit in 2010, excluding credit, is expected to be between 3.7 percent and 4 percent of GDP.",
        "The gap between this forecast and the deficit in the budget proposal derives from higher than expected tax revenues and an upward adjustment of nominal GDP.",
        "The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for August rose by 0.5 percent, exceeding the 0.3 percent average rise predicted by the private forecasters.",
        "The main reason for the gap between the forecast and the actual index was the 1.7 percent increase in housing prices, which was higher than expected.",
        "Food prices also increased by a relatively high 0.7 percent.",
        "The seasonally adjusted August index (using the Research Department's seasonal adjustment method) increased by 0.4 percent.",
        "In the last twelve months the CPI has risen by 1.8 percent, close to the middle of the target range.",

        "One-year-forward inflation expectations derived from the capital market (\"break-even inflation\") remained relatively stable from the last interest rate decision on August 23 to the first week of September, at around 2.7 percent, and in the next two weeks (up to September 24) they increased slightly, to above 2.8 percent.",

        "Most of the forecasters who updated their reports to the Bank of Israel after the publication of the August CPI expected the Bank to increase the interest rate for October by 25 basis points.",
        "On average they assess that the interest rate at the end of similar to the forecast last month.",
        "An analysis of the slope of the makam yield curve indicates that the capital market expects the Bank of Israel interest rate one year hence to be about 2.7 percent.",
        "In the month from the previous interest rate discussion on August 22 to September 24, yields on government bonds increased.",
        "The yield to maturity on unindexed government bonds increased along almost the entire curve, by up to 29 basis points The yield to maturity on one-year _makam increased over the period by 18 b.p., to_ about 2.41 percent.",

        "The increase in yields in Israel concurrent with the decline in yields in the US led to the widening of the yield gap between Israeli and US government bonds.",
        "The nominal yield gap to all terms increased slightly this month.",
        "The yield gap on ten-year bonds increased from 1.76 percentage points on August 20 to 1.94 percentage points on September 22.",
        "The Bank of Israel interest rate _minus twelve-months-forward inflation expectations_ derived from the capital markets averaged minus 1.0 percent in September (to the date of the current discussions), similar to its level in August, as a result of the relative stability of inflation expectations and the fact that the Bank of Israel did not change the interest rate last month.",
        "The modest increase in inflation expectations in the second half of September was reflected in a similar decline in real interest to below In the twelve months up to and including August 2010 the monetary base measured by the M1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by only 1.4 percent, continuing the marked slowdown in the rate of increase of this aggregate in the last few months, against the background of the increase in the rate of interest.",

        "The balance of bank and nonbank credit to the business sector has increased by only 1.2 percent since the beginning of the year.",
        "The housing component in the CPI, which reflects the costs of housing rentals and accounts for about 20 percent of the total CPI, increased by 1.7 percent in August, and by 6.1 percent in the last twelve months––reflecting an acceleration in the rate of increase in the last few months.",
        "In contrast, according to the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of house prices (which are not included in the CPI), these increased in June–July by 0.7 percent compared with May–June, a slower pace than that in the last year and a half.",
        "In the last twelve months house prices have increased by about 20 percent.",
        "Before an assessment can be made as to whether the trend in house prices has changed, developments in the coming months will have to be reviewed.",
        "The recent increases in the Bank of Israel interest rate, together with the increase in building starts (compared with the equivalent period a year ago) are likely to help moderate the rise in house prices.",
        "The number of building starts in the twelve months to June 2010 was about 37,000, compared with about 33,000 in the equivalent period a year earlier––an increase of about 12 percent.",

        "As was the case last month, the price level does not deviate significantly from the level indicated by those factors.",
        "The ratio of average house prices to the average wage per employee post is close to its long-term average, and last month was adjusted downwards a little.",
        "The ratio of house prices to rentals rose rapidly in the last year, but it remained stable in June (last data point).",
        "The slowdown in the rate of increase in house prices, if it persists, will keep house prices relatively close to the level indicated by economic fundamentals.",

        "To a large degree the surprise was due to the 0.6 percent decline in the housing component of the index, its first drop since January 2009.",
        "During 2009 the CPI rose by 3.9 percent.",
        "Excluding the effect of direct government interventions that affected prices (i.e., the increase in VAT, the increase on taxes on cigarettes and fuel, and the water surcharge), the index rose by 2.8 percent, in the upper part of the inflation target range.",
        "One-year-forward inflation expectations derived from the capital market (\"break-even inflation\") rose during January, in particular after the publication of the CPI, so that the January average (till 24 January) was 2.7 percent, higher than the December average of 2.5 percent.",

        "In the last twelve months the M2 aggregate (M1 plus unindexed term deposits of up to one year) increased by 13 percent, and in December it rose by only switching from term deposits to demand deposits in light of the low level of the interest rate on term deposits.",
        "Various scenarios of economic development in the next year were examined using the Bank of Israel’s econometric models.",
        "The underlying assumptions with regard to about 3.5 percent growth in GDP), that the low interest rates around the world would start to rise moderately in 2010, that prices of imported inputs would increase by more than 2 percent, and that world trade would increase by 7.0 percent.",
        "The baseline scenario of the quarterly DSGE (dynamic stochastic general equilibrium) model––which places great weight on expectations and which uses a Bank of Israel reaction function based in part on the smoothing of the interest rate The Bank of Israel uses econometric models to test various scenarios.",
        "Due to their nature, including the fact that their results naturally depend on certain assumptions about relevant variables, the scenarios should be viewed as one input among several in the discussions on the interest rate.",
        "In the abnormal conditions prevailing in the global financial markets since the outbreak of the worldwide financial crisis, and bearing in mind that the models do not directly reflect such events, the weight that can be attached to the forecasts derived from the models is reduced.",

        "The Error-Correction (EC) model yielded inflation of 2.1 percent in 2010, with the Bank of Israel interest rate increasing from an average of 1.6 percent in the first quarter of 2010 to 2.9 percent in the last quarter of the year.",
        "In this scenario the average exchange rate in 2010 would be NIS 3.73 to the dollar.",
        "Based on the results of the models, other indicators and economic forces not reflected by the models, the assessment of the Bank of Israel Research Department is that inflation will moderate in 2010, and will move to within the target range in the second half of the year.",
        "The main factor underlying that assessment is the continued negative output gap––the result of the almost zero growth in 2009 and growth in 2010 expected to be only marginally above potential––and the appreciation of the shekel in the last few weeks.",
        "Nevertheless, looking one year ahead, inflation is still expected to be slightly above the midpoint of the target range, with the interest rate increasing during 2010, against the background of the recovery from the recession and the low starting level of the interest rate.",
        "During the month since the previous interest rate discussions (i.e., from 27 December to 24 January), the shekel strengthened by about 1.7 percent against the dollar, and by about 3.5 percent against the euro.",
        "The nominal effective exchange rate of the shekel, calculated as the trade-weighted average shekel exchange rate against 28 currencies The Tel Aviv 25 share price index on 24 January was about 1.5 percent lower than on major stock exchanges around the world, but in the closing days of the period investors' attitude changed, leading to declines in share prices.",
        "Israel’s risk premium, as measured by the five-year credit default swap (CDS) spread, remained almost unchanged at 1.24 percentage points in the period between the previous and the current discussions on the interest rate.",
        "A similar trend was evident in CDS spreads around the world.",
        "The weight of the dollar in the effective exchange rate is about 24 percent, and that of the euro, about 35 percent.",
        "The recovery of global growth is continuing, and growth accelerated in the last quarter of 2009.",
        "The rate of growth is expected to slow, however, in 2010, when the effects of government support programs end and exit strategies from those programs are implemented.",
        "Several weak spots still persist: the marked divergence between the acceleration in global production and the sluggishness in the services sector; the continued severity of bank credit terms; and the weakness of the US labor market.",
        "The improvement in financial conditions was maintained.",
        "Almost zero level interest rates continue to encourage investors to switch to assets defined as risky corporate credit spreads contracted, although in the last few days they widened again with the change in investors' sentiment.",
        "Despite the increase in commodity and energy prices, inflation and inflation expectations remained moderate, in light of the ongoing weakness of the labor market and the large negative output gap.",
        "Policymakers are caught on the horns of a dilemma.",
        "If they implement a policy that is too expansionary and too long-lasting, it is likely to create a bubble in asset prices and faster inflation, and to undermine the status of governments as issuers of risk-free issuers.",
        "If their policy becomes too tight too early, it increases the risk of a relapse to the situation of pressures in the financial system and recession.",
        "Hence, a process of central banks gradually exiting from their unconventional programs to be followed by only a moderate increase in interest rates is expected in 2010.",
        "In the narrow-forum discussion, four members of management make recommendations to the Governor regarding the appropriate rate of interest for the economy.",
        "In the discussions on the interest rate for February, all of the participating members of management recommended that the Governor leave the rate unchanged at The members stressed the point that the increases in the Bank of Israel interest rate in the last few months was part of a gradual process of bringing the rate back to a level that was more appropriate to the economic situation as reflected by the inflation environment that was in the upper part of the target inflation range, with the recovery in the real economy, and rising asset prices, in particular housing prices.",
        "The gradual nature of the process is reflected by the fact that the Bank does not change the interest rate each month.",
        "Several arguments were put forward supporting a hiatus this month, i.e., for leaving the interest rate unchanged.",
        "Participants discussed the possibility that the surprisingly low inflation rate in December meant that the inflation environment was lower than previously assessed.",
        "As a result of the surprising CPI and the unexpected drop in the owner-occupiedhousing component, the possibility arose that apartment rents were changing direction, or at least that the rate of increase had slowed.",
        "That would have the effect of moderating the rate of inflation in the course of 2010.",
        "This possibility was reflected in the downward revision of private forecasters' inflation expectations for the next few months and for the whole of 2010.",
        "In contrast to this revision, the participants also spoke of the increase towards the upper limit of the inflation target in one-year inflation expectations derived from the capital market that occurred following the publication of the December CPI.",
        "Some participants thought that in light of the small number of bonds around the 12-month horizon which are used for calculating inflation expectations and the low level of trading in some of the series, the figure derived does not necessarily reflect the expectations of those active in the capital market, so that on this occasion less weight than normal should be attributed to these expectations.",
        "In the discussion it was noted that the appreciation of the shekel in January was expected to contribute to reduced inflationary pressures and price indices in the coming months.",
        "Participants discussed the possibility that the increases in the interest rates for December and January were partially responsible for the renewed appreciation and their concern that an increase in the rate for February might boost the trend of shekel appreciation.",
        "Some members thought that another increase in the interest rate would stimulate a significant rise in capital inflow (i.e., would boost carry trade), increasing the pressure for appreciation.",
        "Others were of the view that interest rate considerations were not the dominant factor in capital flows in the last few months, and they did not expect them to become dominant in the current interest rate environment, even if there was another rate increase.",
        "Many more indicators did indeed now give evidence of accelerated growth at the end of 2009, but some participants in the discussion said that these indicators had stabilized and the rate of improvement had slowed, and there was uncertainty regarding the sustainability of the positive trend.",
        "In particular they referred to reports that the upward trend in world trade had halted, together with the recently increased uncertainty about the strength of the global recovery.",
        "After considering all the points raised in the discussion, the Governor decided to leave the interest rate for February unchanged at 1.25 percent.",
        "In its announcement of the decision, the Bank of Israel stressed the following.",
        "The decision to leave the interest rate for February unchanged at 1.25 percent is part of the gradual process of returning the rate to a \"normal\" level intended to bring inflation into, and keep it within, the target range and to contribute to the continued recovery of economic activity, while supporting financial stability.",
        "The main considerations that led to the \"no-change\" decision were: - The inflation environment: The December inflation rate, in particular the owneroccupied-housing component, had been surprisingly low.",
        "Inflation in the first quarter of 2010 was expected to be low, partially due to the recent appreciation of the shekel.",
        "One-year-ahead inflation expectations are within the target inflation range––2.3 percent according to the private forecasters, and 2.7 percent based on the capital market.",
        "- Data published this month indicate that growth in Israel continues to become more firmly established.",
        "That said, the level of uncertainty regarding the strength of the global recovery has risen recently.",
        "- Interest rates of the leading central banks around the world are low, and are expected to remain so during the coming months.",
        "The Bank of Israel stated that it will continue to act to achieve its objectives of price stability and support of employment, growth, and the stability of the financial system.",
        "Finance Division, Research Department In the wake of a growth rate of 2.2 percent in the third quarter of 2009, many indicators pointed to accelerated recovery also in the fourth quarter.",
        "The increase in production supported by the rise in global demand and the replenishment of stocks were particularly notable.",
        "The services sector, however, constituting about 90 percent of the economy, hardly increased in December.",
        "The US economy continued to face up to several weak spots: (1) credit terms for the private sector; (2) the slack in the labor market; and (3) renewed weakness in the real estate market.",
        "The weakness in the labor market was highlighted in the December Employment Report which showed a sharper-than-expected reduction of 85,000 in nonfarm private employment.",
        "Also in December employment fell by 589,000 workers, mainly in the middle working ages (25–54).",
        "There was a concurrent increase in the number of temporary workers.",
        "These figures show that the level of uncertainty in companies remains high, and although they are dismissing fewer workers than in the past, they are in no hurry to recruit new staff.",
        "The renewed weakness in the housing market was reflected in a monthly drop of homes.",
        "The number of foreclosures continues to rise.",
        "The investment houses expect that the growth rate in the fourth quarter of 2009 will accelerate, to 4.7 percent, and that thereafter the rate will slow to between 3.1 percent and 3.3 percent in the first three quarters of 2010.",

        "The investment houses expect that inflation will drop to 1.3 percent at the end of 2010.",
        "It seems that the moderate recovery in the EU is losing momentum, with the ending of the government support programs.",

        "Inflation is low in the EU, 0.9 percent in 2009.",
        "Accordingly, the ECB kept the interest rate unchanged at 1.0 percent, but started exiting from some of the emergency programs it had implemented.",
        "Japan's economic growth rate was 2.7 percent in 2009:Q3 and 1.3 percent in 2009:Q4, mainly due to the export and manufacturing sectors.",
        "The latest economic data, however, were disappointing.",
        "Household expenditure stayed steady, but the reduction in wages continued to depress retail sales, companies' capital investments did not recover, and investment in construction continues along its downward path.",
        "Growing budget deficits resulting from the marked drop in tax revenues and the continuing increase in expenditure by the national insurance will restrict the government's ability to support the economy.",
        "Hence, growth is expected to slow in the first half of 2010, as the government support programs come to an end.",
        "Deflation is still a cause for concern, with prices expected to fall by 1.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009, and further deflation in 2010.",
        "The emerging market economies, and specifically the large Asian ones, are continuing to grow much faster than the advanced economies.",
        "Their recovery is evident in the increase in manufacturing production, world trade, and private consumption.",
        "There was large capital inflow into the emerging economies in 2009, that helped to strengthen the exchange rates of their currencies against the dollar.",
        "The increase in commodity and food prices is expected to boost inflation, despite the large output gap.",
        "Against this background there is growing pressure to increase interest rates.",

        "As stated in the reports of previous interest rate discussions, the Bank of Israel's policy is to continue with the gradual process of bringing the interest rate back to a more \"normal\" level intended to position inflation firmly within the target range, and to contribute to the further recovery of economic activity, while supporting financial stability.",

        "The forecast would be updated next month, following the publication of the results of the Labor Force Survey.",
        "The participants also discussed the possible effects of expanded activity on the real wage, and hence on prices.",
        "Till now, despite increased employment, no significant pressure on the real wage has been felt, they said.",
        "Nevertheless, with unemployment declining, continued increase in activity in the future might result in a reaction on the wage front.",
        "Developments in the housing market in the last few months were also discussed.",
        "It was noted that the rapid increase in house prices (which are not included in the CPI) was continuing, and prices had risen by 2.2 percent in May, and by about 22 percent in the last twelve months.",

        "In light of the persistent trends in the housing market, it was suggested that further macroprudential measures might be needed in this area.",
        "Participants in the discussion noted that in addition to the effect of short-term interest rates on house prices, the decline in medium-term and long-term interest rates related to the decline in interest rates around the world is reflected in the reduction in the cost of financing house purchases, thereby boosting demand.",
        "The rate of inflation in the last twelve months has declined, and is currently slightly below the midpoint of the target range.",
        "It was noted that the inflation rate excluding housing was 0.8 percent in the last twelve months.",

        "Finally, the participants agreed that leaving the interest rate unchanged at 1.75 percent was consistent with the process of gradually returning it to more \"normal\" levels taking economic conditions into account.",
        "They emphasized the need for constant monitoring of developments in the housing market and house prices, including the mortgage market.",

        "Nevertheless central banks in several countries that are already growing relatively rapidly continued with the process of increasing their interest rates last month too, and are expected to continue to do so in the near future.",
        "The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor Israeli and worldwide economic and financial developments, and will use the instruments available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, and in this regard, will continue to keep a close watch on developments in the housing market, and especially on house prices.",

        "The second is employment.",
        "Although unemployment remained steady at 9.5 percent, this incorporates a decline in the participation rate and an increase in the share of hard-core unemployed.",
        "The third area is private consumption, against the background of the publication of disappointing figures of private consumption, personal income, retail sales, and orders for consumer durables.",
        "Nevertheless, a decline in the private sector leverage ratio and an increase in the saving rate to levels that do not justify a further increase may indicate a chance that a recovery in consumption lies ahead.",

        "Germany led the field, with 2.2 percent quarterly growth, contributing about 60 percent of the growth of the whole eurozone.",
        "Most of the growth was due to the increase in exports resulting from the weakness of the euro, with no evidence of an increase in domestic demand.",

        "Israel’s risk premium, as measured by the five-year credit default swap (CDS) spread, increased slightly to 116 b.p., similar to the trend in CDS spreads of countries not related to the debt crisis in Europe.",
        "As in the previous month, most of this month's economic data presented a positive picture with regard to the economies of the US, China, and some European countries, prompting investment houses to make significant upward adjustments to their forecasts of growth in the next two years.",
        "In the US the monetary expansion continues, in the form of QE2, and a new fiscal program was launched, consisting mainly of tax relief.",
        "It seems that the markets brought forward by a few months their forecast of the timing of an increase in the interest rate in the US.",
        "In Europe the debt crisis spread, with reductions in the ratings and rating outlooks in some European countries (the PIGS) and doubts about other countries.",
        "Europe as a whole, spearheaded by Germany, generally presented surprisingly buoyant macroeconomic data, which in the third quarter were based also on domestic demand, and not only exports.",
        "In the emerging market economies, headed by China, rapid growth persisted.",
        "The favorable economic data published on the one hand, and the concern resulting from the high levels of debt and the European debt crisis on the other, prompted investors to switch this month from government bonds to risk assets and led to capital inflows to countries with high growth rates.",
        "This resulted in higher yields on government bonds in the major economies, strengthening of the currencies of countries with rapid growth, and increases in share prices.",
        "Inflation remained low in the advanced economies.",
        "Increased demand for commodities pushed their prices up, boosting inflation in the emerging markets.",
        "In the narrow-forum discussion, four members of management make recommendations to the Governor regarding the appropriate rate of interest for the economy.",
        "In the current discussions on the interest rate for January, all the participating members of management recommended that the Governor leave the interest rate unchanged, at 2.0 percent.",
        "Leaving the interest rate at 2 percent is consistent with the process of gradually restoring a more normal interest rate environment—a process aimed at stabilizing inflation within the target range, and supporting further growth of economic activity while maintaining financial stability.",
        "The pace of interest rate increases depends on the inflation environment, growth in Israel and globally, the monetary policies of the major central banks, developments in asset prices, and the exchange rates of the shekel.",
        "At the current rate of interest, monetary policy continuous to be expansionary.",
        "Several issues were discussed, in particular the effect on the exchange rate of the possible widening of the interest rate differential between Israel and abroad, the effect of the exchange rate on inflation, and an assessment of the inflation environment.",
        "In the discussion it was noted that the inflation environment is relatively high, at least in the short term.",
        "Inflation expectations derived from the capital market ––break-even inflation––is at the upper limit of the inflation target range; the average of forecasters’ predictions are at a similar level, and the CPI, seasonally adjusted, shows a constant increase in inflation since the beginning of the year.",
        "Also, the Research Department forecast of inflation in the next twelve months is 2.6 percent, slightly lower than that of the forecasters, but the Department’s forecast takes into account an increase in the Bank of Israel interest rate, to an average of 3.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011.",
        "It was also noted, however, that despite expanded economic activity there were no signs evident as yet of pressure for wage increases, as the supply of labor had also increased.",
        "In addition, although inflation expectations derived from the capital market for the medium and long terms are above the midpoint of the target inflation range, the risk premium element they contain is higher than that for short-term inflation expectations, so that actual expectations are lower.",
        "The fact that medium- and longterm inflation expectations are close to the midpoint of the target inflation range reflects the credibility of monetary policy.",
        "Participants in the discussion said that an increase in the interest rate would further increase the pressures that already existed at this time for appreciation of the shekel, as widening the interest rate differential would encourage capital inflows that would tend to strengthen the shekel.",
        "Moreover, the assessment was also put forward that the appreciation of the shekel in the last few months had helped to moderate inflation, and if the pressures for appreciation continued, they would continue to hold inflation down also in the future.",
        "Those pressures, if they do come about, will also moderate the rate of increase of the interest rate.",
        "Rapid recovery of activity in the US, however, would bring forward increases in the interest rate there, would narrow the interest rate differential, and enable the interest rate in Israel to increase more rapidly.",
        "It was noted that the most recent data regarding the US capital market show market expectations that the interest rate would rise somewhat earlier than previously expected.",
        "Data since the previous discussions indicate that economic activity continues to expand, and the moderate increase of exports in the past two months following a period of decline is consistent with the development of world trade.",
        "The recovery in exports is fragile, however, and the debt crisis hanging over several European countries is likely to reduce the strength of demand for Israel’s exports and hence also Israel's rate of growth.",
        "In its announcement of the decision, the Bank of Israel emphasized the following points for keeping the interest rate for January 2011 unchanged: - Interest rates of the leading advanced economies' central banks are low, and are expected to remain low for a long time.",
        "Against this background, the differentials between interest rates in countries with relatively rapid rates of growth, including Israel, and those in the advanced economies encourage short-term capital flows, create pressure for the appreciation of the domestic currency, and therefore present a serious challenge for policy makers.",
        "- Inflation expectations for one year ahead calculated from the capital market and those of forecasters declined a little and entered the target inflation range, and are currently slightly below its upper limit.",
        "The Bank of Israel Research Department forecast is that inflation in the coming year will be 2.6 percent, partly due to the appreciation of the shekel last month.",
        "Inflation over the previous twelve months is expected to be slightly above the upper limit of the inflation target range during most of 2011, and then to return to within the target range towards the end of the year.",
        "- House prices increased at a slower rate last month, while the housing component of the CPI declined in the last two months, partly due to the measures introduced by the Bank of Israel and the government to cool the real estate market.",
        "However, it is still early to know whether there has been a change in the trend of house prices.",
        "The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor the developments in this market, and will take whatever steps are needed to underpin financial stability.",
        "- Most of this month's economic indicators support the assessment that economic activity in Israel continues to expand at a rate of about 4 percent per annum.",
        "The investment houses revised their growth forecasts for the US upwards.",
        "Nevertheless, the debt crisis in several European countries is likely to reduce the pace of recovery in those countries and accordingly presents a risk to the rate of growth in Israel.",
        "The Bank of Israel will use the instruments available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, including keeping a close watch on developments in the assets market, and especially in the housing market.",

        "It appears that US policy makers consider that it is still necessary to support economic activity, both by means of monetary expansion (in the form of quantitative easing, QE2, with hints of increasing it beyond $600 billion), and via a new program of fiscal incentives totaling $860 billion (compared with $787 billion in the original program), mainly in the form of tax relief, despite Moody’s reported warning of a possible downgrade of the US credit rating.",
        "There was renewed optimism in the financial markets that started with the announcement of the QE2 program, although early in the period reviewed it seemed that the increasing severity of the European debt crisis was managing to depress it.",
        "The volatility index (VIX) continued to decline, and yields on US government bonds increased.",
        "The negative sentiment about US government bonds led to a net exit by investors from government bond funds for the first time in two years, and to an increase in interest on 30-year mortgages to 4.83 percent, its highest level for seven months, which is likely to constitute a burden to the real estate market, in contradiction to the Fed’s intention.",

        "Several indicators point to continued economic recovery.",

        "Since the beginning of the year, the domestic deficit (excluding credit) has totaled NIS 12.9 billion, 1.6 percent of GDP.",
        "This is lower than the deficit according to the seasonal path, mainly because of higher than expected revenues (about 5 percent in excess of the budget), but also due to under-expenditure of the budget (by 1.6 percent).",
        "The under-expenditure was the result of the over-estimate of interest expenditures.",
        "For purposes of comparison, the deficit (excluding credit) in the same period last year, January–October 2009, was NIS 21.8 billion.",
        "Based on developments to date and on the assumption of almost complete expenditure of the budget, and assuming the upward trend in tax revenues will persist until the end of the year, the total deficit (excluding credit) in 2010 is expected to amount to less than 4 percent of GDP (compared with the ceiling of 5.5 percent of GDP).",
        "The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for October increased by 0.3 percent.",

        "The housing component in the CPI, which reflects the costs of housing rentals and accounts for about 20 percent of the total CPI, has increased by 4.5 percent since the beginning of the year, but in October it declined, by 1.1 percent.",
        "However this decline relates to only one month, and thus cannot be considered the start of a turnaround in the trend of the price of housing services.",
        "One possible explanation, for the sharp change in the housing component in October, is the characteristic seasonal factor, with price changes in the winter months generally lower than average.",
        "From December 2009 to February 2010, for example, there was a cumulative fall of 2.1 percent in this component, followed by renewed sharp increases.",
        "House prices, however, which are not included in the CPI and which are taken from the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) survey of house prices, continued to increase, and on average increased by 1.9 percent in August–September, giving a cumulative increase of 19.7 percent in the past twelve months.",
        "In this case there are conflicting data: Treasury data, based on the median transaction, suggest that house prices have been declining for a few months, while the CBS data suggest that house prices continue to increase at a rapid rate.",
        "The volume of new mortgages granted in October increased by a steep 11 percent compared with the level in September, to NIS 3.58 billion.",
        "All types of mortgage showing increases, but the most prominent increase, of 27 percent, occurred in CPIindexed mortgages at floating interest rates.",
        "It should be noted that in September there was a sharp decline compared with the previous month, due in part to the period of the Jewish High Holydays and to the high volume of mortgages in the summer months.",
        "The flow of new mortgages granted in October was similar to the levels in the summer months.",
        "With regard to the different types of mortgages, the sharp increase in the flow of indexed floating interest mortgages took place against the background of the reduction in interest on mortgages of that type, alongside increases in the interest rate on the other two types––unindexed floating interest, and fixed interest.",

        "The main reason for the forecast being above the midpoint of the inflation target range is the housing component (rentals), which is expected to continue increasing relatively quickly, and energy and commodity prices which have increased considerably in the last few months.",
        "Factors acting in the opposite direction, to slow the rate of price increases, include the low rate of inflation around the world and the appreciation of the shekel in the last few quarters.",
        "The main risks to real economic activity and inflation in Israel derive from developments abroad.",
        "Nevertheless, a renewal of massive capital inflows into Israel, should that occur, with the pressures towards appreciation that they cause, would have a moderating effect on growth and inflation, and a slowing effect on the pace of interest rate increases.",

        "Since the previous interest rate discussions, the Tel Aviv 25 share price index was steady––after a few days of reductions, the index increased again to the peak level it had reached in October following the upward trend that started in the middle of the year.",
        "This was similar to the trends in most stock markets around the world in that period.",
        "Israel’s risk premium, as measured by the five-year credit default swap (CDS) spread, decreased slightly to 111 basis points (b.p.",

        "Assessments, both of the investment houses and of international institutions, are that the process of recovery of the global economy from the trough it had reached was continuing, and the probability of another recession had fallen.",
        "Some investment houses increased their forecasts of growth for the coming months; the OECD, in contrast, revised its forecast downwards.",
        "There is great uncertainty regarding the rate of growth of the global economy, which constitutes a central risk factor for the Israeli economy.",
        "Uncertainty remains high against the general background of the debt crisis in some European countries, in particular Ireland.",
        "Inflation in the advanced economies remains low, mainly due to their output gaps.",
        "In the emerging market economies, however, inflationary pressures grew, mainly due to the increases in commodity prices.",

        "The Fed program is expected to affect the monetary policies of other central banks around the world, mainly those that have started moving to tighter monetary policies, and to present a challenge regarding the persistent appreciation of domestic currencies, increasing capital flows, and increasing inflation.",
        "Several central banks, in economies that have already started growing relatively rapidly, continued increasing interest rates—India, Sweden, Australia, Chile and South Korea increased their interest rates this month— against the background of positive macroeconomic performances and the increase in commodity prices (mainly metals and agricultural commodities).",
        "Thereafter, in light of concern over a possible increase in the interest rate in China, there was a sharp correction to commodity prices.",
        "In the narrow-forum discussion, four members of management make recommendations to the Governor regarding the appropriate rate of interest for the economy.",
        "In the current discussions on the interest rate for December, all the participating members of management recommended that the Governor leave the interest rate unchanged, at 2.0 percent.",
        "They also recommended that, as part of the process of normalizing monetary policy, the interest rate corridor around the Bank's interest rate in the credit window and the commercial banks' deposit window be widened to ±0.5 percent (during the crisis it had been reduced to ±0.25 percent).",
        "Leaving the interest rate at 2 percent is consistent with the process of gradually restoring a more normal interest rate environment—a process aimed at stabilizing inflation within the target range, and supporting further growth of economic activity while maintaining financial stability.",

        "The Bank of Israel Research Department twelve-month inflation forecast, however, is about 2.5 percent.",
        "There was discussion of the factors exerting upward pressure on inflation: the housing market, the approach toward full capacity utilization—as reflected in labor market data and in investment in fixed assets—and the rise in world commodity prices.",
        "Against this, however, the risks to global growth and the moderating influence of developments around the world on Israeli inflation in the coming months were also discussed.",
        "In this discussion, housing featured high on the list of inflationary pressures discussed.",
        "In the last year the housing component of the CPI (based on rentals) was the main inflationary factor.",
        "In the last twelve months the CPI increased by 2.5 percent, and the index excluding housing went up by only 1.4 percent.",
        "The point was made that the sharp and surprising decline of 1.1 percent in the housing component in October does not give grounds for concluding that there has been a turnaround in the price of rentals.",
        "If anything, it is still the other way around: in light of the gap that has arisen between the increase in house prices (19.7 percent in the twelve months to September) and the increase in rentals (4.7 percent in the twelve months to October) rentals may continue to increase.",
        "The (rentals) housing component is the main reason that inflation is expected to be above the midpoint of the target inflation range in the coming year.",
        "With regard to financial stability, the contribution of the low interest rate to developments in the credit markets – especially its contribution to the increase in asset prices, particularly real estate prices – was discussed.",
        "House prices continued to increase rapidly in the last year, due partly to the slow adjustment of the supply of apartments, but also due to the fast increase in housing credit arising from the low rate of interest.",
        "In the discussion emphasis was given to the sharp increase in house prices which itself––and not its indirect effect on inflation––made the Bank introduce macroprudential measures which were taken recently.",
        "Other, even stricter, measures were discussed, which would be taken as necessary.",
        "The need to cool the rapid expansion of mortgage interest was stressed again, not primarily from the inflation aspect, but rather from the financial stability aspect.",
        "Developments worldwide were reviewed, including the quantitative easing in several leading economies (and especially the QE2 program in the US), and their low interest rates.",
        "These present a challenge to monetary policy makers in economies with relatively buoyant demand, such as Israel's; the challenge of dealing with the combination of domestic demand and capital inflows on one side, and the weakness of world trade on the other.",
        "The difficulty becomes more acute in light of the interest rate differentials, the result of the process of increasing interest rate that has started in countries recovering relatively rapidly, Israel among them.",
        "In light of the indications of a slowdown in the growth rate of the Israeli economy, led by a decline in exports against the background of greater uncertainty about world growth, and in light of the macroprudential measures introduced by the Bank of Israel and their implications for inflation, the Governor decided to keep the rate of interest unchanged for December, at 2 percent.",
        "In its announcement of the decision, the Bank of Israel emphasized the following points: - Inflation in the last twelve months is within the target range, and according to assessments of the private forecasters and of the Bank of Israel Research Department it is expected to be slightly above the upper limit of the inflation target range in the first half of 2011, and then to return to within the target range.",
        "Inflation expectations derived this month from the capital market for one year ahead were slightly above the upper limit of the target range.",
        "- Most of last month's economic indicators support the assessment that economic activity continued to expand in the third quarter and in October.",
        "The decline in exports, however––reflecting the effect of the weakness of world trade–– following the rapid increase in exports in the first half of the year, also featured prominently in the data.",
        "The lack of certainty regarding the rate of domestic growth, deriving from uncertainty about global demand, still constitutes a significant risk factor.",
        "- Interest rates of the leading advanced economies' central banks are low, and are expected to remain low for a long time; the Fed reintroduced instruments of quantitative easing.",
        "Against this background, the differentials between interest rates in countries with relatively rapid rates of growth, including Israel, and those in the advanced economies present a serious challenge for policy makers in the rapidly growing economies, who need to strike a balance between domestic pressures to increase the interest rate on the one hand, and the effect such an increase may have with regard to appreciation of their currency and, in turn, on exports and economic activity, on the other.",
        "As part of the process of normalizing monetary policy, the Bank of Israel decided to widen the interest rate corridor around its interest rate in the credit window and the commercial banks' deposit window from ±0.25 percent to ±0.5 percent.",
        "The Bank of Israel stated that it will continue to use the instruments available to it in order to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, including keeping a close watch on developments in the housing market, and especially on house prices.",
        "Finance Division, Research Department The macroeconomic data for last month show a faster rate of recovery than that in the last few months.",
        "The improvement was noted in problematic sectors as well (real estate, employment and credit), with surprisingly positive developments in various confidence indices.",
        "Against this background investment houses revised their forecasts of US growth upwards.",
        "Nevertheless, in the labor market the broad unemployment rate still stood at about 17 percent, and the Case-Shiller index real estate index dropped again in August for the second consecutive month.",
        "Thus, even after the upward revision of the forecasts, the expected rate of recovery remains slow, with some concern over deflation (the Core PCE index for September was 0 percent, and the PPI for October was minus 0.6 percent).",
        "Against this background, the Fed introduced another quantitative easing program, QE2.",
        "Unlike the original QE1 program, which was intended to prevent financial collapse, QE2 is directed towards dealing with the problem of the slow rate of growth.",
        "Some commentators expect the program to be augmented in 2011.",
        "Others, however, do not expect the Fed to implement the program in full.",
        "On the fiscal side, in light of the Republican majority resulting from the congressional elections, President Obama may encounter difficulties in trying to continue with the plan to boost the economy.",

        "The EU continues to confront the problems of the imbalance between member countries, high deficits, and high unemployment (an average of 10.1 percent, with about 21 percent in Spain).",
        "Quarterly growth in the third quarter was 0.4 percent, slightly below the expectations which were 0.5 percent.",
        "This low growth occurred against the background of tight fiscal measures and the strengthening of the euro that impacted negatively on exports.",
        "The monthly indicators for October also fell short of expectations, mainly in Germany, with weak manufacturing production and a steep drop in retail sales.",

        "Bond yield in the PIGS countries, as well as in Ireland, rose sharply in the last month, in light of the persistent crisis in the banking sector (the yield gap between Germany and Ireland widened to 550 basis points).",
        "This was followed by some improvement, against the background of Ireland's announcement that it agreed to accept aid from the EU rescue fund.",
        "In the UK, growth in the third quarter was 0.8 percent, surprising in light of the expectations of 0.4 percent.",
        "The Bank of England expects growth in the next quarters to exceed the long-term trend, but to be moderate compared with the rate in 2010.",
        "Thus the chances of a second quantitative easing program in the UK in the near future have receded significantly.",
        "Inflation is expected to remain above 2 percent next year, with the expected increase in VAT and the continued increase in commodity prices.",
        "Third-quarter growth in Japan exceeded expectations––0.7 percent compared with 0.4 percent, mainly due to the increase in domestic demand.",
        "There are signs, however, of a slowdown in the next few months, particularly in light of the continued strengthening of the yen (exports made a zero contribution to growth in the third quarter), and the assessment that the steep increase in domestic demand was a one-off occurrence that derived from the ending of certain tax reliefs (on vehicles and cigarettes) in October, and that was known in advance.",

        "However, the high degree of uncertainty The Bank of Israel uses econometric models to test various scenarios.",
        "Due to their nature, including the fact that their results naturally depend on certain assumptions about relevant variables, the scenarios should be viewed as one input among several in the discussions on the interest rate.",

        "In the discussions on the interest rate for April, all the participating members of management recommended that the Governor increase the rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 1.5 percent.",
        "As was stated in the report of the discussions prior to the previous decision (of the interest rate for March) decisions on the Bank of Israel interest rate are part of a gradual process of bringing the rate back to a more \"normal\" level intended to bring inflation into the target inflation range and to maintain it there, and to support the continued recovery in economic activity, while maintaining financial stability.",
        "In the discussion, participants spoke of the progress of real activity in Israel against the background of global developments, of the inflation environment, and of changes in asset prices, as factors that should affect the decision on the interest rate for April within the framework of that process.",
        "Real activity continues to expand, but some indicators suggest that it is doing so at a somewhat slower pace.",
        "The point was made that activity expanded rapidly in the last quarter of 2009, but attention was also drawn to the slower increase in exports and the risks facing the continued recovery of economic activity in light of global economic developments from the first quarter of 2010.",
        "Nonetheless, initial findings from the Bank of Israel's Companies Survey for the first quarter of 2010 show further expansion of economic activity and expectations that this would continue in the next quarter.",
        "The current assessment is that the expected path of economic activity is consistent with a gradual upward interest-rate path.",
        "The participants noted that the econometric models used by the Bank indicate that inflation measured over the previous twelve months is expected to be close to the midpoint of the target range in a year's time, alongside a gradually rising interest-rate path.",
        "Other forecasts––those of other forecasters as well as those derived from the capital market, whose predictions of the inflation and interest-rate paths are similar to the Bank's––are consistent with a gradual increase in the interest rate.",
        "The participants in the discussion also spoke of the changes in asset prices, in particular of house prices.",
        "They referred to the effect of the low rate of interest on these prices, the impact of the increase in the interest rate, and the need to monitor and relate to developments in them.",
        "Moreover, mention was made of the issuance of lowrated and unrated corporate bonds, and the question arose as to whether the spreads at which they are issued fairly reflect the company risk.",
        "It was noted that following the previous increase in the interest rate in January, the rate had remained unchanged for two months, and that an increase of the interest rate would be part of the gradual process of returning interest to a more \"normal\" level.",
        "One view expressed emphasized the wide gap between the current interest rate and a \"normal\" rate when nominal GDP is expected to grow by more than 5 percent in Arguments made in favor of leaving the interest rate unchanged this month included the danger an increase would present for continued recovery, and the desire to prevent a widening of the gap between the interest rate in Israel and those in the major central banks, a gap likely to act to strengthen the shekel.",
        "After considering all the points raised in the discussion, especially the real economic activity environment, the expected development in inflation, and the analysis of the development of asset prices, including house prices, the Governor decided to increase the interest rate for April by 25 basis points to 1.5 percent.",
        "In its announcement of the decision, the Bank of Israel stressed the following: - Forecasters' inflation expectations for the next twelve consumer price indices average 2.6 percent; inflation expectations for the next twelve months calculated from the capital market are close to the upper limit of the target inflation range.",

        "Positive signs were evident also in the labor market: job losses were lower than anticipated, employment of temporary workers increased, the rate of participation in the labor force rose, and the number of dismissal notices fell.",
        "Nevertheless, as the Chairman of the Fed noted, recent growth was dependent on fiscal support, and on the process of building stocks, factors expected to weaken during the year.",

        "The main reason for the expectation of a deficit below the ceiling is that tax revenues at the beginning of the year were in excess of the forecasts made when the budget was prepared.",
        "Nevertheless, the rate of increase in tax revenues has slowed in the last few months: VAT on domestic production declined by 5 percent in the three months April–June compared with the level in the previous three months (seasonally adjusted).",

        "Based on the equation, the CPI housing component (i.e., rentals) is expected to rise faster than was estimated previously.",
        "Based on the survey of house prices (which are not included in the CPI, see above), these increased in April by 1.2 percent, and in the twelve months to April (inclusive) by 21 percent, due both to the low rate of interest and to the slow response of the supply of houses to higher prices.",

        "In the discussions on the interest rate for August, all the participating members of management recommended that the Governor increase the rate by 25 basis points, to 1.75 percent.",
        "As stated in the reports of previous interest rate discussions, the Bank of Israel's policy is to continue with the gradual process of bringing the interest rate back to a more \"normal\" level intended to position inflation firmly within the target range, and to contribute to the further recovery of economic activity, while supporting financial stability.",
        "The pace of the interest rate increases is not predetermined, but is set in accordance with the inflation environment, growth in Israel and globally, the monetary policies of the major central banks, and in light of developments in the exchange rates of the shekel.",
        "In the discussion, participants spoke of the upward revision in the Research Department's assessment of inflation, and of the increase in inflation expectations derived from the capital market and the private forecasters' inflation assessments to around the upper limit of the target inflation range.",
        "The point was made that the upward revision in the Research Department's inflation forecast derived mainly from the shekel depreciation shown by the effective exchange rate, the expectation that housing prices would continue to rise, and the government's decision to increase indirect taxes.",
        "Turning to the real economy, it was noted that there was apparently rapid growth in the second quarter, despite the decline in exports resulting from the slowdown in global activity.",
        "Moreover, particular mention was made of the continued recovery in the labor market: the wage is rising and unemployment is still falling.",
        "Nevertheless, attention was also drawn to the fact that indicators such as the composite state-of-the economy index, the Bank of Israel's Companies Survey, the Purchasing Managers Index, and foreign trade data suggest that growth slowed during the second quarter, and this will be reflected in the data for third quarter.",
        "Some participants thought that despite the less buoyant figures expected for the third quarter, it seems that uncertainty and the real-side risks actually declined this month due to the reduction in the risk that the debt crisis in Europe would become more severe.",
        "An analysis of all the factors led to the assessment that positive growth would continue in line with the Bank of Israel's previous forecast––that 2010 growth will be 3.7 percent, along with a gradual contraction of the output gap.",
        "With regard to the housing market, participants discussed the rise of 21 percent in house prices in the twelve months to May and the continued increase in mortgage credit.",
        "They referred to the extent of the need for macroprudential measures in light of the increase in house purchases for investment purposes and the high share of mortgage credit at floating interest rates.",
        "Reference was made to the Supervisor of Banks directive which went into effect at the beginning of July, requiring banks to make an additional provision for housing loans given with high loan-to-value ratios.",
        "It was suggested that the increase in new mortgages in the last few months may have resulted from buyers preempting the new directive by bringing forward their house purchase.",
        "Most of the participants thought it best to wait till the effects of the steps already taken have been further evaluated before introducing other macroprudential measures.",
        "Finally, the participants stressed that even after the recommended increase of 25 basis points in the interest rate, policy would still be expansionary.",
        "Taking into consideration the various points made in the discussion, the Governor decided to increase the interest rate for August by 25 basis points, to 1.75 percent.",
        "In its announcement of the decision, the Bank of Israel stressed the following conditions that led to the decision to leave the interest rate unchanged for July: - Inflation forecasts of the Bank of Israel, of the private forecasters and the capital market for one year ahead are around the upper limit of the target inflation range.",
        "- Housing prices and the housing index (rents) are continuing to increase rapidly, together with a rapid expansion of housing credit.",
        "- An analysis of the whole range of data on the real side and the labor market leads to the assessment that positive growth will continue in accordance with the Bank's previous forecasts, with a gradual contraction of the output gap.",
        "- Interest rates of the central banks of the major advanced economies are at very low levels, and in light of recent developments are expected to remain so for some considerable time.",
        "Nonetheless, central banks in several countries that are already growing relatively rapidly continued with the process of increasing their interest rates last month, and are expected to continue to do so in the near future.",
        "The Bank of Israel will continue to act to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system.",
        "Finance Division, Research Department The macroeconomic data on the US economy published in the last few weeks indicate a general deterioration and a greater probability of a slowdown in the rate of growth in the next few quarters (but not a recession), against the background of, among other things, the ending of the fiscal programs and the continued weakness in the labor and real estate markets.",
        "There is concern that growth engines such as business sector investment and private consumption are not strong enough yet to replace the fiscal stimuli.",
        "Against this background the Fed reduced its growth forecast for 2010 by 0.2 percentage points to between 3.0 percent and 3.5 percent.",
        "The main problem continues to be the labor market.",
        "The rate of unemployment declined only because of the reduction in the rate of participation, the number of new employees was lower than had been forecast, and the proportion of the unemployed who were out of work for more than 27 weeks remained high, at 45 percent.",
        "The real estate sector is still weak: the number of building starts fell in June by 5 percent to its lowest level in eight months; the number of house foreclosures by the banks started rising, and the number of short sales (in which a home is sold at a price should be noted that the weakness in the real estate market is also related to the ending of the home purchase aid program.",
        "The above led to the postponement of the predicted timing of the start of increases in the interest rate.",
        "Some of the forecasters even expect that the first increase will not be before some time in 2012.",
        "In addition, a greater number of assessments expect that the Fed will introduce additional measures and that the aid programs will be extended.",
        "Such expansionary activity will apparently continue to constitute the main basis of the US economic recovery.",
        "The fiscal measures introduced in the problematic European economies, the good results of the stress tests of the European banks, and the positive macroeconomic data of the EU, all these served to alleviate concern over the European debt crisis.",
        "The fiscal steps taken in the last few months (the cutbacks in public expenditure and increases in taxes) eased investors' concern regarding some countries' insolvency, so that bond issues countries such as Spain, Portugal and Greece were successful.",
        "Furthermore, the other EU countries are meeting their requirements for finance, having so far raised some 60 percent to 70 percent of their requirements for this year.",
        "The successful results of the stress tests of the banks calmed the concern over the European banking system.",
        "In the scenario examined, of the 91 banks (that constitute about 65 percent of the European banking market), only 7 failed, and the additional capital required amounted to only $4.5 billion.",
        "The overall European data published in the course of the month were positive, and exceeded expectations, mainly regarding Germany, that continues to be the major engine of growth in the eurozone.",
        "This was partly due to the weakening of the euro during the crisis, which helped the competitiveness of the export sector––which occupies a dominant position in the European economy.",
        "Despite the lower level of concern in Europe, the ECB is expected to leave the interest rate at its current level in the next few months and to continue to buy bonds (albeit on a smaller scale).",
        "Various tightening policy measures taken in China are showing some success: The annual growth rate in the second quarter of 2010 was 10.3 percent, lower than the market's expectations.",
        "In addition, the rate of increase in credit continues to decline, and house prices started falling again in June.",
        "The various purchasing managers indices continue to reflect a slowdown in the Chinese economy.",
        "Against this background, inflation slowed this month, and fell back to less than 3 percent.",
        "In the other emerging markets, particularly those in East Asia, rapid growth persisted in the second quarter.",
        "Those economies continue to benefit from increasing intraregional trade and from the ongoing capital inflow from foreign investors who prefer these economies to the advanced economies."

        "Based on the second estimate of first quarter National Accounts data, which were revised downward, the economy grew by 4.8 percent, but the growth was impacted markedly by volatility in vehicle imports.",
        "The figure reflects moderate growth in private consumption and solid growth in exports, mainly in services industries.",

        "As noted, four Committee members were of the opinion that the interest rate should be kept at its current level.",
        "They explained that even though the inflation environment has been stable for several months within the inflation target range, there is currently particularly high uncertainty regarding economic developments in Israel and abroad, and therefore the interest rate should remain unchanged at this time.",

        "The Committee noted the decline in one-year expectations and forecasts from various sources to around the lower bound of the target range, and the decline in medium-term forward expectations.",

        "They noted the continued trend of expansion in exports, led by services exports, and the fact that companies' reports for the Business Tendency Survey do not indicate a decline in orders from abroad or in profitability.",
        "The Committee believed that the labor market remains tight, and noted in particular the continued increase in nominal wages, led by the business sector, as an important factor in supporting the return of inflation to the target range.",

        "In addition, there was an easing of the terms of finance.",
        "Mortgage interest rates continued to decline moderately, due to the decline in government bond yields, while the upward trend in mortgage volume continued.",
        "It was noted that the decline in medium- and long-term bond yields, without a significant increase in corporate bond spreads, makes the terms of financing for the business sector easier as well.",
        "The Committee discussed the uncertainty in and risks to global economic activity.",
        "It noted that most of the signs point to a continuation of the slowdown in world trade, with forecasts of world trade and growth in most blocs revised downward.",
        "In addition, it was noted that the \"trade war\" between the US and China is continuing, and that the risks derived from the realization of Brexit have increased.",
        "In parallel, the assessments that monetary policy makers in the major economies are signaling further monetary accommodation were discussed.",

        "The ECB left its interest rate unchanged, but signaled additional accommodative measures.",
        "Following the discussion, the Committee members were of the opinion that the interest rate should be left at its current level, and expressed the assessment that it will not rise for a prolonged period.",
        "Most of the Committee members believed that the recent decline in the inflation environment to below the target range, together with a combined trend of appreciation and negative global economic developments increase the risk to achieving the goals of monetary policy.",

        "The discussion focused primarily on real economic activity, the global environment, recent developments in financial markets, the inflation environment, and the expected path of monetary policy.",
        "The Committee assessed that the slowing down in economic activity on the annual level derives mainly from the supply constraint, and that the economy is apparently converging to its potential growth rate.",
        "Labor market data support the assessment that the economy is at a full employment environment—the unemployment rate is low, the job vacancy rate (demand for workers) is high, and wages continue to rise.",
        "Although in recent months the unemployment rate increased slightly, and the job vacancy rate declined somewhat, the Committee members assessed that the labor market remains tight.",
        "The Committee noted that the growth rate increased in the fourth quarter of 2018, after it had slowed down in the second and third quarters, and that the increase was driven by growth in private consumption.",
        "The Committee members were of the opinion that the increase in imports also supports the assessment that the slowing growth reflects the supply constraint—the increase in domestic demand was met by imports, and less by domestic production.",
        "Data on foreign trade and from the Business Tendency Survey indicate some weakness in exports, particularly goods exports.",
        "The Committee discussed the price increases in financial markets from the beginning of the year, after the sharp declines at the end of 2018.",
        "The Committee noted several possible reasons for the price increases, including a correction to the declines in 2018, the expectation that for now the global process of monetary tightening will halt, and optimism in markets regarding the signing of US-China trade agreements, which could create a positive impact on the global economy.",
        "The Committee members agreed that the global economy continues to lose momentum.",
        "The IMF again revised downward its growth forecast for most regions, particularly for Europe.",
        "Recently, there have been assessments that the global slowdown will lead to a deferral in interest rate increases in the US and in a contraction of the quantitative easing in the eurozone.",
        "With regard to the housing market, the Committee members noted that the decline in home prices moderated and industry activity continues to show weakness: in particular, investment in residential construction is low.",
        "It was observed that if the slowdown in residential construction continues, it is liable to moderate the rate of growth in the coming period.",
        "Regarding the inflation environment, the Committee members noted that there was no major change in it since the previous interest rate decision.",
        "After the annual inflation rate declined in December to below the target range, it returned in January to above the lower bound, and the Committee members assessed that in the coming months inflation will hover near it.",
        "The Committee pointed to the gaps observed between tradable inflation and nontradable inflation (an estimate for the domestic component of inflation)—while the former is approximately 2 percent, the latter turned negative.",
        "Since the previous interest rate decision, 1-year expectations and forecasts from the various sources continue to range around the lower bound of the target range, while medium-term and long-term expectations increased slightly toward its midpoint.",
        "It was noted that wage increases have not yet been reflected in sharp price increases, and that could be due to enhanced competition.",
        "However, in view of the labor supply constraint and wage pressures, it is plausible that in the future there will be stronger pass-through from wage increases to prices.",
        "In addition, the Committee noted that since the previous interest rate decision, the shekel had strengthened by approximately continues, it is liable to weigh on the return of inflation to the midpoint of the target range.",
        "In the discussion on the path of monetary policy, the Committee members noted that the challenge for policy is in the need to return inflation to around the midpoint of the target, and that the gradual reduction in the extent of monetary accommodation will be carried out accordingly.",
        "The Committee assessed that the economy growing at a rate in line with its potential pace will support the continued increase of inflation, but as the global economy is showing signs of slowdown, inflation is expected to return to around the midpoint of the target range gradually.",

        "The discussion focused primarily on real economic activity and uncertainty regarding real activity in the near future, apparent trends in the level of world trade, the appreciation of the shekel since the beginning of the year, and the expected path of monetary policy.",
        "The Committee's assessment was that the economy is continuing to grow at a pace similar to the potential rate, and that the relative slowdown in second and third quarter data in 2018 was transitory.",
        "This assessment is supported mainly by the tight labor market—a high employment rate and a low unemployment rate together with a high job vacancy rate (demand for workers), which are reflected in continued wage increases, primarily in the business sector.",
        "Private consumption recovered, evidence of the high level of demand in the economy.",
        "For now, the concern of unusual fluctuations in the financial market that would negatively affect real activity has subsided.",
        "The Committee members noted that this assessment is also supported by Composite State of the Economy Index data for the first quarter of 2019, foreign trade data, and the Consumer Confidence Index.",
        "However, they noted that a number of indicators point to the possibility that the labor market strength has reached its peak.",
        "There is an apparent slight easing in the labor shortage constraint as reported by employers in a number of industries, and the job vacancy rate remains high but is declining moderately.",
        "The Committee members noted that first and second quarter data are expected to be \"noisy\" in view of increased vehicle imports in the first quarter, which will apparently have a beneficial effect on investment, private consumption, and GDP data, while the effect is expected to be offset in the second quarter, and this should be noted when analyzing developments and setting policy.",
        "Regarding the housing market, the Committee members noted that the number of transactions continued to increase, particularly among first-time home buyers, alongside the prolonged decline in investment in residential construction.",
        "The Committee members discussed the moderation of global economic activity, the downward revision of global growth forecasts, and the change in expectations regarding the path of global interest rates and monetary policy.",
        "In the US, current expectations are that the interest rate path will be lower than previous expectations, and in Europe, the expected start of interest rate increases has been delayed.",
        "The Committee members stated that the decline in world trade is expected to continue affecting activity in Israel.",
        "The Committee discussed other risk factors that are affecting the global economy, including the uncertainty surrounding Brexit and a possible trade agreement between the US and China.",
        "The Committee believed that some of the risks may also be to the upside.",
        "It is possible to expect, for instance, that if the US and China do reach a trade agreement, optimism will return to the global markets, which will support the continued increase of activity in the domestic market.",
        "The Committee members discussed the fiscal situation, the measures that the future government may take to deal with the expected deficit, and their possible effects on economic activity and on the inflation path.",
        "They believed that it is still too early to assess what effect fiscal policy may have on real activity or on the inflation path, because in any case, fiscal uncertainty is expected to remain for some time, at least until the formation of the new government.",
        "Regarding the inflation environment, the Committee members noted that there was no major change since the previous interest rate decision.",
        "The annual inflation rate remains above the lower bound, and the members' assessment was that in the coming months inflation will hover near it.",
        "The Committee members stated that the trend of widening gaps between inflation in the prices of nontradables (an estimate for the domestic component of inflation) and of tradables continued—while the former is approximately interest rate decision, 1-year expectations and forecasts from the various sources increased slightly, and continue to range around the lower bound of the target range, while medium-term expectations are slightly below its midpoint.",
        "In the Committee members' assessment, the full employment environment is expected to strengthen the pass-through from wages to inflation.",
        "The Committee also discussed the continued strengthening of the shekel since the previous interest rate decision.",
        "Since the beginning of the year, the shekel has strengthened by about 4.5 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate.",
        "In the Committee's assessment, if the appreciation continues, it is liable to make the inflation rate’s return toward the midpoint of the target more difficult, and if necessary, the Bank of Israel will consider using the tool of intervention in the foreign exchange market.",
        "As stated, four of the Committee members believed that the interest rate should be left at its current level.",
        "The fifth Committee member believed that the current interest rate is not in line with the state of the economy, and that it is proper to raise it to 0.5 percent, since inflation has been within the target range for some time.",
        "In contrast, the other Committee members believed that even though there has been some increase in the inflation environment, the interest rate should be left at its current level for the time being, in view of the uncertainty regarding the forecasts of global real economic activity and monetary policy, and regarding the future path of inflation in Israel.",
        "Their assessment was that narrowing the extent of monetary accommodation should be done in a gradual and cautious process to support the continued increase of inflation to the midpoint of the target range.",

        "The discussion focused primarily on the picture of real economic activity and the development of exports, the risks reflected from the global economy, developments in the inflation environment, the fiscal uncertainty, and the expected path of monetary policy.",
        "The Committee discussed developments that occurred in the inflation environment in recent months.",
        "The Committee members noted that the year over year inflation rate remained low, below the lower bound of the target range, but that 1-year expectations remained stable near the lower bound of the target range.",
        "In addition, it was noted that medium-term expectations and long-term forward expectations declined moderately.",
        "The Committee noted that the inflation environment also declined when looking at the CPI excluding energy, fruit and vegetables, and they noted the negative impacts of the strengthening of the shekel and the moderation of the increase in housing prices.",
        "The Committee members discussed the significant appreciation that has taken place since the beginning of the year, and noted that the shekel is notable in its strengthening relative to most currencies.",
        "They assessed that continuation of the appreciation will weigh on the return of inflation toward the midpoint of the target range.",
        "The Committee members noted that although the inflation rate is expected to return to the lower bound of the target in a range of about a year, the uncertainty regarding that is high.",
        "With regard to economic activity, the Committee assessed that the economy continues to grow at around its potential rate.",
        "According to initial estimates for the third quarter, the economy grew by 4.1 percent, and the Research Department assesses that net of the volatility deriving from vehicle imports, the growth rate in the quarter was slightly below 3 percent.",
        "The Committee members noted that according to company reports in the Business Tendency Survey, in the manufacturing industries there was no worsening in the exporter-profitability constraint while in the services industries there was a slight increase in this percentage.",
        "However, it was noted that the exchange rate impacts exports with a lag, and therefore it is possible that the cumulative appreciation of the shekel will have a negative effect on exports going forward.",
        "In addition, the Committee members noted that the labor market remains tight: the most recent data indicate a decline in unemployment, even if with a decline in the participation and employment rates.",
        "The increase in wages continues to be driven by the business sector, but at a slightly slower rate than what prevailed in the beginning of the year.",
        "The job vacancy rate has declined moderately for several months now, but it is still high and at this stage, it is not clear that it is an indication of a slowdown in activity.",
        "The Committee discussed the impacts of the uncertainty regarding the fiscal situation, against the background of the continued political uncertainty and the handling that will be required in view of the expected deficit and the impacts on real activity and the path of inflation.",
        "The Committee members assessed that until now, there have not been signs of a negative impact from the political situation in Israel on the economy, but they noted that to the extent that the government will be required to act based on an interim budget for an extended period of time, it will have a restraining impact on activity.",
        "In addition, one Committee member noted that although the business sector does know how to deal with uncertainty in the short term, there is a concern of a negative impact on economic activity and productivity in the long term.",
        "The Committee members also discussed the uncertainty and the risks to economic activity worldwide.",
        "They noted that most signs point to a slowdown in the pace of global economic activity and that, according to the most recent OECD forecast, global growth is expected to remain low.",
        "However, there has recently been some decrease in the risks of a marked slowdown deriving from a deterioration in the “trade war” between the US and China and from a “hard Brexit”.",
        "In parallel, a discussion was held on the assessments that the accommodative monetary measures around the world are nearing exhaustion.",
        "In particular, the messages conveyed by the Fed indicate that the federal funds rate will remain at its current level unless there is a material change in the economic situation, and the markets are estimating that the ECB is not expected to change the interest rate in the next two years.",
        "After a discussion, four Committee members were of the opinion that the interest rate should be kept at its current level.",
        "Three of those members claimed that in view of the economy continuing to grow at close to its potential rate, the labor market remaining tight, inflation being expected to begin converging to within the target range beginning in a year, and the Fed and ECB apparently having exhausted their interest rate reductions at the current stage, the interest rate can be kept at its current level for now, and to use additional monetary tools.",
        "However, they added that the risks to activity and to inflation are significant, so there may be a need to increase the extent of monetary policy accommodation going forward.",
        "The fourth member claimed that at the current level of the real interest rate, monetary policy is very accommodative, and given the growth and employment conditions, there is no need for additional accommodation.",
        "In contrast, one Committee member voted in favor of reducing the interest rate to 0.1 percent.",
        "He claimed that the cumulative appreciation is liable to adversely impact economic activity and to act toward a continued decline in inflation, which in any case is at a low level.",
        "In addition, according to that same Committee member, the moderation of economic activity worldwide is a significant risk, and requires an enhancement of the level of monetary accommodation.",
        "The Committee members were of the opinion that in view of the inflation environment in Israel, the monetary policies of major central banks worldwide, the moderation in the global economy, and the continued appreciation of the shekel, it will be necessary to leave the interest rate at its current level for a prolonged period or to reduce it in order to support a process at the end of which inflation will stabilize around the midpoint of the target range, and so that the economy will continue to grow at an adequate pace.",
        "Moreover, the Committee members noted that the Committee takes additional steps as necessary to make monetary policy even more accommodative.",

        "Three Committee members supported the proposal to keep the interest rate unchanged, and two Committee members supported the proposal to reduce it to 0.1 percent.",
        "The discussion focused primarily on the inflation environment and the contribution of the shekel's appreciation to the decline in the inflation rate; the picture of real economic activity and the development of exports in view of the risks to the global economy in particular; global economic developments, and in particular accommodative monetary steps taken by several central banks; the fiscal uncertainty; and the expected path of monetary policy.",
        "The Committee held a broad discussion on the change that has taken place in the inflation environment in recent months.",
        "The Committee members noted that the year over year inflation rate remained low, below the lower bound of the target range.",
        "Although most 1-year expectations are near the lower bound of the target range, medium-term expectations rose, and long term forward expectations remained anchored near the midpoint of the target range, inflation is still expected to decline further in the coming months, before returning to around the lower bound of the target.",
        "The Committee noted in this regard the significant negative contribution deriving from relatively volatile components and from the strengthening of the shekel.",
        "The Committee members assessed that the marked appreciation since the beginning of the year is the result of the relatively good state of Israel’s economy and the surplus in the current account, but the change in global relative interest rates also had an effect, as well as the impact of Israel being included in the WGBI index.",
        "The Committee assessed that enhanced competition in the economy, and the expansion of the phenomenon of retail purchases online, have also created downward pressure on prices.",
        "However, one Committee member claimed that it could be that the moderation in economic activity worldwide also made a negative contribution to domestic inflation despite it seeming that it has not yet impacted activity in Israel.",
        "The Committee members noted that the uncertainty regarding the future path of inflation is high.",
        "Looking ahead, it was noted that if the government will decide to raise indirect taxes, it will have a one-off impact on prices, but is not expected to impact on the inflation path.",
        "With regard to economic activity, the Committee members noted that most indicators point to the economy having continued to grow at around its potential rate in the third quarter.",
        "They emphasized the strength of private consumption that in recent years has been a growth driver for the domestic economy.",
        "In addition, it was noted that exports are growing at a solid pace, led by services exports, but the Business Tendency Survey shows some increase in the share of companies reporting a severe constraint in export profitability, after a decline in this share during 2018.",
        "They added that to date there aren’t signs of a negative impact from Israel’s political situation on the economy, but they agreed that the uncertainty regarding the steps the government, when it is established, will take to reduce the deficit increases the uncertainty regarding developments in the domestic economy.",
        "The Committee was of the opinion that the labor market remains tight, as indicated as well from comprehensive analyses of Labor Force Surveys.",
        "The Committee discussed the moderation in the rate of increase of nominal wages, but noted that wages in the business sector, in particular, continue to increase adequately.",
        "The Committee discussed the increased risks to global economic activity, primarily in view of the “trade war” and the uncertainty regarding Brexit.",
        "It emphasized the deterioration in world trade and in growth forecasts of advanced economies.",
        "It was noted that until now, the Israeli economy apparently has not been impacted by the global slowdown, but the Committee members noted that should the slowdown reach capital markets and the technology industries, a more notable impact on the Israeli economy would be expected.",
        "After an extended discussion, three Committee members were of the opinion that the interest rate should be kept at its current level.",
        "One of them claimed that at the current level of the interest rate, monetary policy is very accommodative and is not in line with real conditions in the economy, and that the deviation of inflation from the target range does not derive from a slowdown in economic activity, but from an extended adjustment process of the price level in Israel to the price level of prices worldwide.",
        "The two other Committee members claimed that in view of the economy growing at a solid pace and inflation being expected to converge to within the target range beginning in another year, the interest rate can be left at its current level, but they noted that the risks to activity and to inflation are significant, therefore it could be that there will be a need to increase the extent of monetary-policy accommodation in the future.",
        "In contrast, two Committee members voted in favor of reducing the interest rate to 0.1 percent.",
        "They claimed that the cumulative appreciation, the pressures for continued appreciation due to the monetary accommodation worldwide and the inclusion in the WGBI index, are liable to act toward a continued decline in inflation, which in any case is at a low level.",
        "They added that the moderation of activity worldwide is a significant risk, and therefore action should be taken now already to avoid negative consequences later, especially as the current growth in Israel is positively impacted by the expansionary fiscal policy so far.",
        "The Committee members were of the opinion that in view of the inflation environment in Israel, the monetary policies of major central banks worldwide, the slowing in the global economy, and the continued appreciation of the shekel, it will be necessary to leave the interest rate at its current level for a prolonged period, or to reduce it in order to support a process at the end of which inflation will stabilize around the midpoint of the target range, and so that the economy will continue to grow at an adequate pace.",
        "Moreover, the Committee members agreed that if necessary, the Committee will take additional steps to make monetary policy even more accommodative.",

        "After the discussion, it was decided to keep the interest rate unchanged at 0.25 percent.",
        "The decision was unanimous.",
        "The discussion focused primarily on real economic activity, recent developments in financial markets, the inflation environment, and the expected path of monetary policy.",
        "The Committee assessed that the slowing in economic activity this year reflects a combination of transitory factors and supply constraints, and looking forward it appears that the economy is converging to its potential growth rate.",
        "This assessment is mainly supported by the tight labor market—a low unemployment rate alongside a high job vacancy rate (demand for workers) and a high employment rate; these are reflected in wages that continue to accelerate, primarily in the business sector.",
        "The Committee members noted that the growth in imports also supports the assessment that the slowing rate of growth reflects a supply constraint, as the increase in domestic demand is satisfied by imports and less so by domestic production.",
        "The Committee discussed the potential for declines in financial markets and the lack of stability seen in them in recent weeks to impact on the domestic economy.",
        "The members assessed that the developments to date will impact directly on the real economy to only a small extent.",
        "They assessed that an adverse impact in the value of the public’s assets portfolio has a relatively small effect on private consumption (the wealth effect), among other reasons because a notable part of the public’s financial wealth is held in pension funds and private consumption is not especially sensitive to their current returns.",
        "The Committee members were of the opinion that a greater risk to real activity is incorporated in the possibility that the lack of stability will contract companies’ funding sources and make them more expensive, particularly in the high tech industry, though at least for now significant signs of that occurring are not seen.",
        "They were of the opinion that to date, it appears that the declines in financial asset prices are not anomalous in view of the prolonged period of rises that preceded it, and therefore their effect on domestic real activity is expected to be limited.",
        "In contrast to the above, the concern was raised that if the capital market declines abroad lead to a slowdown in advanced economies, it would negatively impact demand for Israeli exports.",
        "The Committee members were of the opinion that the main risk from abroad derives from the real channel.",
        "The global economy is losing momentum, and it appears that the main drag on advanced economies is from Europe and Japan, while the US is growing at a reasonable pace.",
        "The global slowdown, the uncertainty regarding financial markets and regarding the ramifications of the trade war between the US and China, as well as the slowing pace of monetary policy normalization in advanced economies are liable to adversely impact demand for domestic output, also because they can lead to renewed appreciation pressures on the shekel.",
        "Regarding the housing market, the Committee was of the opinion that the risk it poses to financial stability decreased, as described in detail in the Financial Stability Report published by the Bank of Israel in December.",
        "With that, the Committee emphasized that in order to support continued moderation in home prices, the pace of building starts needs to be accelerated, after it declined markedly in the past year.",
        "Regarding the inflation environment, the Committee members noted that it is around the lower bound of the target range.",
        "Inflation expectations derived from the capital market, for all terms, are within the target range.",
        "However, the Committee noted that forward expectations for long terms (five-year, five year forward inflation) declined to below the midpoint of the target.",
        "Some of the Committee members claimed that the increase in the inflation rate is losing momentum, both looking backward and in terms of expectations, and that it derives from, among other things, the halt in the shekel’s depreciation, the decline in energy prices, and from the slowing, to an extent, in activity in Israel and abroad.",
        "In contrast, other Committee members noted that the inflation rate appears relatively stable, and that the tight labor market and wage increases will ultimately be expressed in higher prices as well.",
        "In this regard, some of the Committee members claimed that the increase in demand for workers and the wage increases derive to some extent from enhanced competition, alongside the moderation of the inflationary pressures that it brings.",
        "Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that the pass-through from the wage increases to prices will be only partial.",
        "The Committee members noted that the government’s efforts to reduce the cost of living are welcome.",
        "They agreed that although these moderate the measured inflation rate, but they noted that in order to set monetary policy the development of prices excluding their effects should be examined as well.",
        "In the discussion on the monetary policy path, the Committee members assessed that in view of the robust state of the economy, while in contrast the enhanced risks, the process of raising the interest rate is expected to be gradual and cautious, so that it will support the increase in inflation to around the midpoint of the target range.",
        "They noted that the challenge of the policy is in the need to support inflation so as to return it to around the midpoint of the target range, while gradually reducing the level of monetary accommodation.",

        "Five Committee members supported the proposal to keep the interest rate unchanged, and one Committee member supported the proposal to reduce it to 0 percent.",
        "The discussion focused on the possible factors in the increase of the inflation environment and the extent to which they are expected to persist over time, foreign exchange market developments, and the monetary policy required with regard to these aspects; as well as the improved state of the labor market and the decline in the unemployment rate against the background of the economy returning to routine; the risks remaining despite the rapid recovery of economic activity; global activity, particularly the increase of inflation worldwide, and against this background the monetary policy in the various economies, and the housing market. '",
        "Main points of discussion The Committee discussed the increase in the inflation environment reflected in the year over year inflation rate being near the lower bound of the target range, as well as the increase seen in inflation expectations.",
        "There is a more marked increase in inflation worldwide than in Israel (particularly in the US, where core inflation reached 3.1 percent) and there is a vigorous discussion as to what extent the price increase is transitory, or if it is a basis for more entrenched inflation.",
        "Committee members analyzed the possible reasons for the increase in the inflation environment in Israel.",
        "Supply problems, including delays in the supply chain of raw materials, difficulties in filling positions, and the increase in overall inflation being based mainly in an increase in prices of tradable goods, support the assessment that the increase in prices is transitory.",
        "In contrast, inflation expectations for all terms derived from the capital markets—short term as well as medium and long term—are showing an increase, and are already around the midpoint of the target, which could reflect market expectations that the increase in the inflation environment will remain for a considerable time.",
        "The Committee was of the opinion that it is still difficult to determine how transitory the increase in the inflation environment is, and that the development of inflation going forward should be followed, but it assessed that a breakout of inflation is not plausible.",

        "The purchase plan for 2021 announced by the Monetary Committee supports the continued exit from the crisis and the return of inflation to the target range.",
        "It was noted that it will be possible to expand the program as necessary and in accordance with the development of economic conditions.",
        "The Committee discussed the improvement of the labor market—against the background of the economic recovery, the expected termination of some of the assistance programs, the decline in the broad unemployment rate and the increase in the adjusted employment rate since emerging from the third lockdown—though the rates are still markedly low compared with the levels just before the coronavirus crisis.",
        "Alongside that, some of the data indicate difficulties in the labor market’s recovery process: the number of job vacancies continues to increase sharply, together with an increase in employers’ difficulty in recruiting workers in some industries—with a record number of manufacturing companies reporting constraints in hiring nonprofessional workers.",
        "The Committee members agreed that despite the contraction of GDP in the first quarter of 2021, an examination of the composition of uses conveys a positive picture of the state of the economy and that the contraction is primarily a result of transitory factors.",
        "Therefore, the Committee assessed that the economy’s recovery is expected to continue.",
        "In addition, the Committee assessed that the adverse impact on activity as a result of the deterioration in the security situation during May apparently had only a limited negative impact.",
        "The available indicators of economic activity point to a continued trend of improvement.",
        "The level of credit card expenditure returned to, and even crossed, the trend line that had been expected before the crisis; a notable increase in consumption also continued in industries that were markedly negatively impacted by the limitations; indices of mobility to stores increased until just before the conflict to the highest level since the beginning of the pandemic; the Central Bureau of Statistics Consumer Confidence index increased sharply until just before the confrontation, mainly as a result of a sharp improvement in expectations of the economic situation in the coming year; based on the Central Bureau of Statistics Business Tendency Survey for April, the overall net balance of the business sector continued its upward trend; and in addition, based on the latest real time survey of the Central Bureau of Statistics, it can be seen that the negative impact on companies’ revenue in March was the lowest since the outbreak of the crisis.",
        "Together with that, the Committee discussed the risks remaining despite the rapid recovery of economic activity—and in this regard the risk of a renewed outbreak of the coronavirus, the security risks, the political uncertainty, and the financial risks.",
        "The increased pace of vaccination worldwide is helping the global economic recovery, and the growth forecasts of investment houses were revised upward for most major economies, but in parallel there was a worsening of morbidity in several emerging markets.",
        "The integrated global Purchasing Managers Index increased in April to its highest level in the past decade, and the expansion in activity was reflected in both the services and manufacturing components.",
        "Main equity indices were mixed during the period but remain at record levels.",
        "The Committee was of the view that the pricing of some financial assets may not incorporate the range of risks.",
        "The monetary policy at major central banks continues to be very accommodative despite the increase in inflation, while in contrast, in emerging markets interest rates continue to be raised, against the background of higher inflation.",
        "The Committee discussed the rising prices in the housing market, against the background of removing the limitations on investors and the ending of new government-initiated construction plans.",
        "The Committee expressed concern about the ramifications that may be created on the revenue distribution and the inequality in the economy if the trend of accelerated increases in home prices is renewed.",
        "Home prices increased in the past 12 months by 4.5 percent, a relatively high rate, against the background of the moderation in the pace of construction—both building starts and building completions.",
        "In addition, there was an increase in the prices of construction inputs, the share of investors in total home purchase transactions increased, and mortgage volumes continued to be high.",
        "With that, the rate of increase of rents remained at a moderate level.",
        "Most Committee members assessed the current level of monetary accommodation, through its various tools, to be sufficient for now, particularly in view of the additional tools being implemented.",
        "The Committee will formulate its policy so that it will continue to provide macroeconomic support in the process of exiting the economic crisis, and to ensure that the credit market continues to function.",
        "Five of the Committee members were of the opinion that the interest rate should be left unchanged at 0.1 percent.",
        "These five Committee members thought that the low level of the interest rate supports a recovery of economic activity and a gradual return of inflation to the target range, particularly in view of the Bank of Israel using additional tools in the credit market and in the foreign exchange market.",
        "One Committee member voted in favor of reducing the interest rate to 0 percent.",
        "He believed that in order to support the recovery, an interest rate lower than 0.1 percent is more appropriate due to the intensity of the crisis and the unusually intense impact on the employment level in the economy.",
        "The Committee noted that the process of returning to normal life in Israel supports continued rapid growth in the coming year.",
        "However, there are still challenges to economic activity—in view of the health risks in Israel and abroad and the adverse impact on the economy, and particularly on the labor market.",
        "The Committee will therefore continue to conduct very accommodative monetary policy for a prolonged time, using a range of tools as necessary, including the interest rate tool, in order to continue to support the attainment of the policy targets and the recovery of the economy from the crisis, and to ensure the continued orderly functioning of the financial markets.",
        "The Monetary Committee sets the interest rate in a process that includes two discussions––the first in a broad forum, and the second in a narrower one.",
        "In the broad-forum discussion, the relevant background economic conditions are presented, including the real and financial-monetary developments in Israel’s economy, and developments in the global economy.",
        "Participants in this discussion include the members of the Monetary Committee, senior representatives from the various departments of the Bank, and economists from the economic departments (Research and Markets), who prepare and present the material for discussion.",
        "In the narrow forum—which consists of the Monetary Committee and a representative of the Markets Department—the Research and the Markets Departments present their views of the main considerations that should guide the setting of the monetary policy.",
        "An open discussion on monetary policy follows, which ends with a vote on the level of the interest rate.",
        "According to Section 18(c) of the Bank of Israel Law, 5770–2010, the decision on the interest rate is reached by majority vote of the members of the Monetary Committee who participate in the voting.",
        "A summary view of the economic situation available at the time of the Committee’s discussion is presented in the [notice regarding the interest rate decision, which was](https://www.boi.org.il/en/NewsAndPublications/PressReleases/Pages/19-04-21.aspx) The members of the Monetary Committee participating in the discussion decide on the appropriate rate of interest.",
        "After the discussion, it was decided to keep the interest rate unchanged at 0.1 percent.",
        "Five Committee members supported the proposal to keep the interest rate unchanged, and one Committee member supported the proposal to reduce it to 0 percent.",
        "The discussion focused on the expected path of inflation and the monetary policy required in that regard; as well as the state of the labor market—where there is a high rate of broad unemployment at the same time as considerable difficulty for employers to recruit workers; the high growth rates expected against the background of the notable easings in coronavirus limitations, together with the expected lengthy recovery until the economy matches the level of GDP and employment that would have been expected had the crisis not occurred; the stabilization of the exchange rate; the decline in financial market spreads and an easing in the financing constraints in the credit market; and the improvement of the global economy, particularly the US.",
        "The Committee discussed the increase in the inflation environment reflected in the year over year inflation rate entering positive territory, CPI readings for February and March being higher than expected, as well as in rising inflation expectations.",
        "The Committee discussed the question of whether the recent rise in prices is only a transitory correction to the low price levels during the course of the crisis.",
        "The Committee was of the opinion that it is too early to determine that, and that developments in inflation should continue to be followed going forward, but it assessed the probability of an outbreak of inflation to be low.",
        "The various indices of inflation expectations have been on an upward trend for several months, reflecting the expectation that inflation will return to the lower part of the target range in the coming months.",
        "The increase in inflation expectations could be explained by the upward trend of actual inflation, the economic recovery in Israel and the improvement in the global economy as well as the rise in inflation expectations worldwide, the increase in global commodity prices, the accommodative monetary policy, as well as the stabilization of the exchange rate in view of the Bank of Israel’s intervention policy.",
        "Since the last interest rate decision, the exchange rate has been stable—the shekel appreciated by 1 percent in terms of the effective exchange rate and against the euro, and weakened by 0.4 percent against the dollar.",
        "At the end of 2020 and in the beginning of 2021 there was a sharp appreciation due to the strengthening of foreign currency flows into the economy.",
        "This was against the background of the increase in direct investments in Israel, foreign-exchange sales by institutional investors against their capital market profits, an increase in investment by nonresident entities in Israeli government bonds, and the growth in the current account surplus, part of which was impacted by transitory factors.",
        "The Monetary Committee’s decision on the purchase program for 2021 at an unprecedented scope of $30 billion supports the continued exit from the crisis and the return of inflation to within the target range.",
        "The Committee declared that it will continue to comply with the program as announced and will even expand it to the extent necessary, in accordance with the economy’s conditions and development.",
        "According to the forecast by the Research Department—which this time presented only one scenario—GDP is expected to grow by 6.3 percent in 2021 and by 5 percent in a large extent the output gap created at the GDP level due to the contraction in 2020.",
        "This forecast reflects the optimism due to the decline in morbidity, the reduction of limitations and the relatively rapid opening of the economy, as well as the pace of expansion of activity, which are made possible by the high effectiveness of the vaccinations.",
        "The current forecast for the level of GDP is slightly higher than in the scenario of rapid vaccinations that the Department published in January.",
        "The main factor that contributed to the higher forecast is the higher level of activity at the end of the end of 2021 is expected to be higher than what was expected in the previous forecast, and this is true for the GDP level in 2022 as well.",
        "At the same time, the level of GDP at the end of 2022 is still expected to be slightly lower (a gap of about 1.4 percent) compared with its expected level had the crisis not occurred.",
        "The Committee expressed concern over the state of the labor market, and the slow recovery expected in it, as in 2022 as well the broad unemployment rate is expected to be 6 percent, higher than its level just before the crisis.",
        "The return of the unemployment rate to its low levels of just before the crisis is expected to take a long time.",
        "The government’s policy regarding employment could also have an impact in this regard.",
        "The Committee noted that the broad unemployment rate is high, yet at the same time employers have considerable difficulty in recruiting workers, as seen in the Business Tendency Survey conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics as well as in the record number of job vacancies.",
        "With the recent opening of industries that were closed for a prolonged period of time, such as the restaurants and leisure industries, an adjustment process is expected between demand for work and the supply of work, which can last for some time.",
        "At the same time, the Committee noted the concern that government policy does not create enough incentives for workers to return to the labor market.",
        "The increase in the pace of vaccinations worldwide is aiding the global economic recovery.",
        "The International Monetary Fund revised its growth forecast upward for all the major regions.",
        "World trade continues to grow and its level is higher than before the crisis.",
        "The inflation rate increased in all major regions, but core indices remained lower than central bank targets.",
        "Monetary policy at the major central banks continues to be very accommodative.",
        "The US is showing signs of significant economic recovery, as a result of the rapid distribution of vaccines, a reduction in restrictions, and the launch of a fiscal program at a significant scope of 8.5 percent of GDP, alongside a planned tax reform that, if implemented, is expected to have a global impact.",
        "In contrast, in Europe there is an increase in morbidity that has led the major countries in the eurozone to announce a renewal of the lockdown policy.",
        "Most Committee members assessed the current extent of monetary accommodation, through its various tools, to be sufficient for now, particularly in view of the additional tools being adopted.",
        "The Committee will design its policy so that it will continue to provide macroeconomic support for exiting the economic crisis, and to ensure that the credit market continues to function with low and stable interest rates and that the supply of credit remains adequate.",
        "In February and March, for the first time since the crisis began, the average level of the difficulty reported by companies in recruiting workers declined, and returned to the levels observed just before the crisis in all industries, except for the hotels industry, among other reasons due to the policy steps taken by the Bank of Israel and the Ministry of Finance.",
        "Five of the Committee members were of the opinion that the interest rate should be left unchanged at 0.1 percent.",
        "These five Committee members thought that the low level of the interest rate supports a recovery of economic activity and a gradual return of inflation to the target range, particularly in view of the Bank of Israel using additional tools in the credit market and in the foreign exchange market.",
        "One Committee member voted in favor of reducing the interest rate to 0 percent.",
        "He believed that an interest rate lower than 0.1 percent is more appropriate due to the intensity of the crisis and the unusually intense impact on the employment level.",
        "The Committee noted that the opening of the economy and the return to normal life in Israel are expected to support continued rapid growth in the coming year.",
        "However, there are still challenges to economic activity—in view of the health risks in Israel and abroad—and the adverse impact on the economy, and particularly on the labor market, is expected to be prolonged.",
        "The Committee will therefore continue to conduct very accommodative monetary policy for a prolonged time, using a range of tools as necessary, including the interest rate tool, in order to continue to support the attainment of the policy targets and the recovery of the economy from the crisis, and to ensure the continued orderly functioning of the financial markets.",

        "After the discussion, it was decided to keep the interest rate unchanged at 0.1 percent.",
        "The decision was unanimous.",
        "In addition, the Bank of Israel will complete its corporate and government bond purchase programs in the markets during December, and thus will bring to an end the bond market intervention programs that were announced during 2020.",
        "The discussion focused on the state of morbidity and the risks deriving from it; the state of real activity and particularly the labor market; the increase in the inflation environment worldwide and the slowing becoming apparent in the inflation rate in Israel; the sharp appreciation of the shekel; and the continued upward trend of housing and capital market prices.",
        "The Committee discussed data on activity and the labor market.",
        "National Accounts data indicated some slowing in the third quarter of the year, after accelerated growth in the quarter before that; labor market data indicate some difficulty in the economy’s returning to its pre-crisis levels; the number of job vacancies continues to increase, with increases particularly in industries that were considerably adversely impacted in the crisis, but due to adjustments in the labor market this has not been manifested in a change in the employment rate.",
        "The total net balance of the business sector is at a high positive level; business activity continues to expand and an accelerated increase in tax revenues can be seen; the levels of goods and services exports are higher than they were just before the crisis, but some moderation can be seen in the most recent data.",
        "A discussion was held on the inflationary factors and the extent of their persistence.",
        "Since the previous interest rate decision, there has been some slowdown in the rate of increase in inflation in Israel, despite strengthening inflation worldwide.",
        "Inflation in Israel over the past 12 months is 2.3 percent, and according to the various forecasts, the inflation rate is expected to moderate going forward.",
        "The Committee members noted that inflation in Israel is markedly lower than in many other countries and is within the target range, as are expectations.",
        "They noted that so far, worldwide, there have only been interest rate increases in countries in which there was a marked deviation from the inflation target, while in Israel the expectations derived from the capital market are within the target range, and according to the Bank of Israel Research Department forecast and private forecasters, the inflation rate is expected to be lower in another 12 months.",
        "In addition, assessments of central banks and forecasters in major economies are that a considerable part of the increase in the inflation environment worldwide is not expected to persist.",
        "The Committee assessed that there is no concern of an inflationary outbreak.",
        "The global economy continues to recover.",
        "However, the level of GDP in many countries remains lower than that derived from the growth path before the crisis, and there are increasing signs of some slowdown in the global growth rate.",
        "The disruptions in the production and supply chains continue, but oil prices declined and transport prices decreased slightly during the reviewed period, and it may be that they signify the beginning of a change.",
        "In the US, the Federal Reserve kept the interest rate unchanged, and announced a contraction of its purchase program.",
        "In the eurozone, the ECB kept the interest rate unchanged.",
        "Since the previous interest rate decision, the shekel strengthened by 4.4 percent vis-àvis the dollar, by 5.7 percent in effective exchange rate terms, and by 6.4 percent against the euro.",
        "It was noted that the Bank will continue to act in accordance with the state of the economy and the continuation of economic activity.",
        "The pace of increase in home prices continues to be high; home prices increased by 10 percent in the past 12 months and mortgage volume continues to hover at a high level compared to the past.",
        "Alongside these, the annual rate of increase in rent prices remains relatively moderate.",
        "All six members of the Monetary Committee were of the opinion that the interest rate should be kept unchanged at 0.1 percent.",
        "They claimed that the low level of the interest rate supports the continued recovery of economic activity.",
        "The Committee members noted that in light of the increase in inflation expectations, the real interest rates in Israel are negative and are at a similar level to those in major economies.",
        "They were of the assessment that the Israeli economy’s process of recovery from the crisis continues.",
        "However, there are still challenges to economic activity.",
        "Therefore, the Committee decided to continue to conduct accommodative monetary policy for a prolonged time, in accordance with the pace of growth and employment and in the path of inflation.",
        "This is all in order to continue to support the attaining of the policy targets and the economy’s recovery from the crisis, and to ensure the continued orderly functioning of the financial markets.",

        "Five Committee members supported the proposal to keep the interest rate unchanged, and one Committee member supported the proposal to reduce it to 0 percent.",
        "The discussion focused on the economic ramifications of entering a further lockdown and the state of the labor market, the path of recovery of economic activity in view of the inoculation campaign in Israel, economic developments worldwide, the development of the exchange rate, fiscal uncertainty, the extent of monetary policy accommodation, and the functioning of the domestic credit market. '",
        "Main points of discussion The Monetary Committee discussed the economic ramifications of the entering a further lockdown in view of the significant increase in morbidity.",
        "The Committee members noted that as of the date of the discussion, the restrictions on economic activity are lighter than those that were imposed in previous lockdowns.",
        "The Committee’s assessment was that the earlier-than-expected start of the inoculation campaign and the rapid pace of inoculations support a rapid recovery of the economy.",
        "The available indicators regarding activity in November and December (such as data on credit card expenditures and mobility) show an improvement in activity following the exit from the second lockdown.",
        "However, the variance in the damage between the major industries continues.",
        "Businesses and those employed in industries such as tourism, restaurants, education, and leisure were impacted more significantly and for a more prolonged period.",
        "The Committee discussed the state of the labor market.",
        "The broadly defined unemployment rate declined to about 13 percent in the first half of December, after having reached approximately 23 percent during the second lockdown.",
        "However, unemployment is expected to increase due to the new restrictions on activity.",
        "The impact to employment is greater in industries where wages are lower.",
        "A real-time survey conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics indicates an increase in the volume of business closures and a higher impact rate among small businesses.",
        "Committee members expressed concern over the ramifications of the crisis on inequality in the economy.",
        "The Committee discussed the two scenarios that appear in the Research Department’s staff forecast.",
        "The first scenario includes the rapid inoculation of the population by May 2021 (“the rapid inoculation scenario”), in which case there will be a rapid recovery of the economy such that by the end of 2022, GDP will be about 2 percent lower than its long-term trend.",
        "In the second scenario (“the slow inoculation scenario”), the inoculation process will be more prolonged, and last until June 2022, such that by the end of 2022, GDP will be more than 4 percent lower than the long-term trend.",
        "In both scenarios, there will be no restrictions with significant economic repercussions on activity following the completion of the public inoculation campaign.",
        "In addition, in both scenarios, activity will be at a higher level than what was projected in the previous forecast in October.",
        "The Committee members agreed that in view of the rapid pace of inoculation, the rapid inoculation scenario is more likely.",
        "In contrast, they noted the high level of uncertainty surrounding the forecast.",
        "Among other things, they noted the possibility of various scenarios: a scenario in which the virus mutates so that it is resistant to the vaccines that have been developed, lower effectiveness of the vaccine in the longer term (“immune memory”), and a renewed increase in morbidity that would require additional restrictions on activity.",
        "The Committee discussed the appreciation of the shekel in recent months, as well as its effect on the export and import substitute industries and on the decline in inflation.",
        "The Committee noted that thus far, services exports (excluding tourism) are showing strength, and are continuing to grow strongly, and that in recent months, there has also been an apparent recovery of goods exports.",
        "In addition, the Committee noted the recovery in world goods trade.",
        "However, looking forward, it was noted that the appreciation may have a cumulative nonlinear effect on exports, which may lead to a serious impact that could occur with a lag.",
        "In view of this, the Bank of Israel has in recent months purchased large volumes of foreign exchange in order to moderate appreciation pressures.",
        "The Committee members were of the opinion that the appreciation pressures are partly due to the relatively strong macroeconomic conditions of the Israeli economy, particularly the current account surplus, together with the continued growth of services exports and investments by foreign companies in Israeli hi-tech companies, as well as hedging activity by institutional investors against their investments abroad.",
        "The Committee members’ assessment was that continued appreciation may lead to the closure of export companies, particularly small ones.",
        "Regarding budgetary policy, the Committee’s assessment was that the economy’s operation under an interim budget is leading to a tighter fiscal policy.",
        "However, the Committee noted the government increased the budget base for 2020 so that the interim budget for 2021 will be less contractionary than had it remained unchanged.",
        "Some of the Committee members expressed the assessment that in view of the third lockdown, additional economic relief packages would be necessary, particularly if a decision is made to further tighten the restrictions on activity.",
        "The Committee noted that so far, developments in the capital market reflect investors’ trust in the Israeli economy despite the budgetary uncertainty.",
        "The Committee discussed developments in the global economy.",
        "Data were presented regarding the pace of inoculation around the world, which is increasing persistently, and which in many cases is in line with set targets.",
        "However, in some countries, the rate of morbidity is higher than the pace of inoculations, and morbidity is therefore expected to increase in the short term.",
        "The pace of growth in 2021 is expected to vary greatly between economies, and some economies are not expected to recover even in fiscal packages were launched.",
        "The Committee noted that the morbidity increase in Europe is expected to lead to fourth quarter data that show contraction in activity.",
        "In addition, there is a decline in the 2021 forecast for Europe.",
        "Growth forecasts for the US were revised upward, but American labor market data indicate moderation.",
        "The Committee discussed monetary policy and whether it is sufficiently accommodative in view of the economic conditions, the rapid pace of inoculation in Israel, the start of a third lockdown in view of the increasing morbidity rate, and the fact that the economy is operating under an interim budget that is leading to tighter fiscal policy.",
        "The Committee discussed the financial conditions in Israel relative to the world.",
        "Most of the Committee members expressed the assessment that the current extent of monetary accommodation, with the variety of tools being used, is sufficient for the time being, particularly in view of the additional tools being used in the credit market, such as the payment deferral program.",
        "They noted that the financial system is functioning in an orderly fashion and that the various indicators are not pointing to serious credit distress.",
        "However, they noted that the small and micro business segment is encountering greater difficulty in raising credit.",
        "The Committee was informed that the legal and operational infrastructure for one of the new components of long-term monetary loans, the use of mortgage portfolios as collateral on the part of the banks, has been completed, and that the implementation of this component has already begun.",
        "The Committee expressed the assessment that this step will enable the banking system to increase business credit, particularly to small businesses.",
        "The Committee members noted that interest rates in the economy have remained low, despite the increase in credit risk, partly due to policy measures taken by the Bank of Israel and the Ministry of Finance.",
        "The Committee expressed the assessment that in the coming months, the use of additional accommodative measures may become necessary.",
        "Five Committee members were of the opinion that the interest rate should be kept at its current level of 0.1 percent.",
        "These five Committee members were of the opinion that the low level of the interest rate supports a recovery of economic activity and a gradual return of inflation to the target range, particularly in view of the fact that the Bank of Israel is using additional tools in the credit market and in the foreign exchange market.",
        "One Committee member voted in favor of reducing the interest rate to 0 percent.",
        "He was of the opinion that an interest rate lower than 0.1 percent is more appropriate due to the magnitude of the crisis and the adverse impact, anomalous in its magnitude, on the employment level.",
        "He added that he does not rule out the possibility that a more accommodative monetary policy will be necessary in the future and that the interest rate may need to be lowered to a negative rate.",
        "The Committee decided to leave the other policy measures previously decided upon in place.",
        "The Committee noted that the rapid pace of inoculations in Israel increases optimism regarding a rapid return of the economy to a path of growth in the coming year.",
        "However, the risks to activity remain high, and the adverse impact to the economy, and particularly on the labor market, is expected to be prolonged.",
        "The Committee will therefore continue to utilize a range of tools in order to increase the extent of monetary policy accommodation and to ensure the continued orderly functioning of the financial markets.",
        "The Committee will expand the use of existing tools, including the interest rate, and will operate additional tools, to the extent that it assesses that it is necessary in order to achieve the monetary policy goals and to moderate the adverse economic impact resulting from the crisis.",
        "The Monetary Committee sets the interest rate in a process that includes two discussions––the first in a broad forum, and the second in a narrower one.",

        "After the discussion, it was decided to keep the interest rate unchanged at 0.1 percent.",
        "The decision was reached unanimously.",
        "The discussion focused on the increase in morbidity and the risks that derive from it, the state of real activity, the inflation environment, the continued upward trend of housing prices, the exchange rate, and trends in the global economy. '",
        "Main points of discussion The Committee discussed the increase in the number of serious cases of illness and the continued spread of the Delta variant of the coronavirus, alongside the third-vaccination campaign.",
        "The Committee noted the considerable uncertainty regarding the continued spread and discussed the possible ramifications on activity should infection continue to spread and the government will be required to tighten the existing limitations.",
        "Alongside the ramifications of COVID-19 and the uncertainty looking forward, the Committee noted the positive economic data published since the previous interest rate decision.",
        "The Committee discussed the positive labor market data and National Accounts data, which indicated strong growth in the second quarter and included an upward revision of first quarter growth data.",
        "Activity returned to its long term trend in most industries, but is below trend in the vulnerable proximity industries, particularly incoming tourism, hospitality, and culture.",
        "In addition, the share of job vacancies out of total employee posts remains high.",
        "A Central Bureau of Statistics update to historical GDP data indicates that nominal GDP in 2020 is about one percent higher compared to previous publications, and that the precrisis historical growth rates, from which potential GDP is derived, were higher than previous assessments.",
        "The Committee discussed the possible ramifications of the growth trend and its effects in coming years.",
        "The Committee discussed the increase in the inflation environment to the middle of the target range and the extent to which inflation is expected to persist.",
        "Compared to data at the previous interest rate decision, inflation of nontradable items continues to rise, led by components impacted by the opening of the economy, while the rate of increase in prices of tradable goods was stable.",
        "The increase in prices encompasses a greater number of CPI components.",
        "The Committee discussed 1-year inflation expectations, which are within the target range—expectations derived from the capital market and from inflation contracts are at the middle of the target range, while forecasters’ projections are slightly lower.",
        "Medium-term and long-term expectations remained anchored in the middle of the target range.",
        "The Monetary Committee is following these developments closely, and its assessment is that there are no signs of an outbreak of inflation.",
        "The global economic recovery continues, though there is growing concern that the Delta variant will lead to an increase in morbidity and a return of the limitations, and thus lead to a slowdown in activity and increased difficulties in the global production chain.",
        "The IMF’s global growth forecast for 2021 remained unchanged at 6 percent.",
        "However, according to the IMF, a scenario of a significant spread of morbidity in the world would remove 0.8 percent from global growth this year and 0.8 percent in 2022.",
        "Monetary policy in major economies remains very accommodative—major central banks kept their interest rates unchanged and did not change purchase programs.",
        "However, the US Federal Reserve emphasized the progress in attaining the goals of the accommodative monetary policy, and announced that it will consider its continuation in its coming meetings.",
        "Additionally, in several developing economies, in which inflationary pressures are seen, there were interest rate increases.",
        "Since the previous interest rate decision, the shekel strengthened by 0.6 against the dollar, by 1.5 percent in terms of the effective exchange rate, and by 2.2 percent against the euro.",
        "It was noted that the intervention this year is not limited to $30 billion, and at the end of the program the Bank will intervene in the foreign exchange market at its discretion, taking into account the state of the economy.",
        "Home prices increased in the past 12 months by 7.6 percent, a rapid pace compared to that of previous years, against the background of moderation in the number of building starts and building completions in the past year.",
        "The increase in housing prices in recent years has also been accompanied by an increase in prices of construction inputs.",
        "Total transactions in May remained high.",
        "In the past year, investors sold homes at a similar scope to their purchases, after recent years when investors were net sellers of homes.",
        "Together with these, the pace of rental price increases remained relatively moderate.",
        "The Committee members assessed that the current extent of monetary accommodation, via a range of policy tools, is appropriate for now.",
        "The Committee will formulate its policy so that it will continue to provide macroeconomic support for the process of exiting the economic crisis, and will ensure that the credit market continues to function.",
        "All six members of the Monetary Committee were of the opinion that the interest rate should be kept unchanged at 0.1 percent.",
        "They were of the view that that the low level of the interest rate supports the continued recovery of economic activity.",
        "One member was of the opinion that the strong National Accounts data and the increase in the inflation environment could have made it possible to begin gradually reducing the extent of monetary policy accommodation, however in view of the renewed increase in morbidity it is best to be very cautious and at this time to retain the current policy.",
        "The Committee noted that the Israeli economy’s process of recovery from the crisis continues.",
        "However, there are still challenges to economic activity, in view of the increased health risks in Israel and abroad.",
        "Therefore, the Committee will continue to conduct very accommodative monetary policy for a prolonged time, using a range of tools as necessary, including the interest rate tool.",
        "This is in order to continue supporting the attainment of the policy targets, the economy’s recovery from the crisis, and ensuring the continued orderly functioning of the financial markets.",

        "After the discussion, it was decided to keep the interest rate unchanged at 0.1 percent.",
        "The decision was reached with a majority of 5 members, while one member supported increasing the interest rate to 0.25 percent.",
        "In addition, it was decided that the continued economic activity and sound growth will make it possible to end the various quantitative easing programs over the coming months.",
        "The discussion focused on the state of real activity and the return of data on GDP and inflation to their environment of just before the COVID-19 crisis, the increase in the inflation environment and assessments regarding the transitory components and the fixed components in it, global economic trends, the exchange rate, and the continued upward trend of housing prices.",
        "The Committee discussed data on activity and the labor market.",
        "National Accounts data indicated high growth and that the level of GDP moved closer to around the level that would have been expected if not for the COVID-19 crisis.",
        "The broad unemployment rate and the adjusted employment rate stabilized and job vacancies in the economy are being filled at a relatively slow pace due to labor market frictions; the total net balance of the business sector is at a high positive level; business activity continues to expand, and continued recovery from the fourth wave can be seen as well in credit card purchases.",
        "In particular, there were increases in purchases in industries that were markedly adversely impacted by the COVID-19 crisis.",
        "Goods exports are higher than just before the crisis, and services exports are characterized by a steep upward trend.",
        "In addition, based on the Research Department’s forecast, solid economic growth is expected in 2021 and 2022.",
        "The Committee discussed the increase in inflation to around the middle of the target range and the extent to which inflation is expected to persist.",
        "Inflation over the past 12 months is 2.2 percent.",
        "One-year inflation expectations, from all sources, increased and are within the target range.",
        "Based on the various forecasts, the inflation rate is expected to moderate going forward.",
        "There was a discussion that dealt with the inflationary factors and the extent to which they will continue—the global economic recovery, the removal of limitations, and an increase in disposable income, brought with them notable waves of demand.",
        "At the same time, the supply side is recovering more slowly and so far has not yet fully recuperated.",
        "As a result, we are seeing disruptions in economic activity, which are accompanied by increases in energy prices and by delays in various production and supply chains—delays that it is reasonable to presume are transitory.",
        "These two processes—sharp growth in demand and difficulties on the supply side— naturally lead to inflationary pressures worldwide, and to a lesser extent in Israel.",
        "It is important to emphasize that their magnitude and extent to which they will last is still not clear.",
        "However, the Committee members emphasized that while the inflation environment in Israel has increased, it is still markedly lower than in many countries and is within the target range, as are expectations, and that there is no concern of an inflationary outbreak.",
        "The global economy continues to recover in light of the moderating pace of morbidity and an increase in vaccination rates.",
        "However, it appears that the momentum is weakening due to difficulties in the global production chain and an increase in energy prices that increases the existing risks of inflation.",
        "Investment banks’ growth forecasts essentially did not change regarding the expected rate of global growth, but in a segmentation by blocs, there was a decline in the forecasts for the US and Japan, and an increase in the forecast for Europe and developing economies.",
        "The inflation environment worldwide continues to be high, but the baseline forecast of central banks in major economies and in capital markets is that a considerable part of the increase is not expected to persist.",
        "In the US, the Federal Reserve kept the federal funds rate and its asset purchase program unchanged, but signaled a reduction in the purchase program in the near term by bringing forward the forecast for an initial interest rate increase to the end of 2022.",
        "In the eurozone, the ECB kept the interest rate unchanged, but announced its intention to slightly slow its purchase program.",
        "Since the previous interest rate decision, the shekel weakened by 0.5 percent against the dollar, by 0.3 percent in terms of the effective exchange rate, and by 1.1 percent against the euro.",
        "It was noted that the intervention in the foreign exchange market this year is not limited to $30 billion, and at the end of the program the Bank will intervene in the foreign exchange market at its discretion, taking into account the state of the economy.",
        "The rate of increase of home prices remains high; in the past year the rate reached 8 percent, against the background of a continued decline in building completions.",
        "Due to an increase in home prices and growth in the number of transactions, mortgage volume continues to rise at an increasing pace.",
        "Five members of the Monetary Committee were of the opinion that the interest rate should be kept unchanged at 0.1 percent.",
        "These five members claimed that the low level of the interest rate supports the continued recovery of economic activity.",
        "They were of the view that despite the economy’s dealing with the current wave of morbidity without severe limitations on activity, there is still a great deal of uncertainty regarding economic activity in the medium term, particularly in view of the risk of cyclicality of additional waves of morbidity as well as regarding the extent of how transitory the inflation is.",
        "One Committee member voted in favor of increasing the interest rate to strong National Accounts data, the increase in the inflation environment and expectations for all terms being anchored in the target range, and the increase in financial risks.",
        "The Committee noted that the Israeli economy’s process of recovery from the crisis continues.",
        "However, there are still challenges to economic activity.",
        "The Committee will therefore continue to conduct accommodative monetary policy for a prolonged time.",
        "Continued economic activity and sound growth will make it possible to end the various quantitative easing programs in the coming months.",
        "This is all in order to continue supporting the attainment of the policy targets and the recovery of the economy from the crisis, and to ensure the continued orderly functioning of the financial markets.",
        "The Monetary Committee sets the interest rate in a process that includes two discussions––the first in a broad forum, and the second in a narrower one.",
        "In the broad-forum discussion, the relevant background economic conditions are presented, including the real and financial-monetary developments in Israel’s economy, and developments in the global economy.",
        "Participants in this discussion include the members of the Monetary Committee, senior representatives from the various departments of the Bank, and economists from the economic departments (Research and Markets), who prepare and present the material for discussion.",
        "In the narrow forum—which consists of the Monetary Committee and a representative of the Markets Department—the Research and the Markets Departments present their views of the main considerations that should guide the setting of the monetary policy.",
        "An open discussion on monetary policy follows, which ends with a vote on the level of the interest rate.",
        "According to Section 18(c) of the Bank of Israel Law, 5770–2010, the decision on the interest rate is reached by majority vote of the members of the Monetary Committee who participate in the voting.",
        "A summary view of the economic situation available at the time of the Committee’s discussion is presented in the [notice regarding the interest rate decision, which was](https://www.boi.org.il/en/NewsAndPublications/PressReleases/Pages/22-2-21.aspx) The members of the Monetary Committee participating in the discussion decide on the appropriate rate of interest.",
        "After the discussion, it was decided to keep the interest rate unchanged at 0.1 percent.",
        "Five Committee members supported the proposal to keep the interest rate unchanged, and one Committee member supported the proposal to reduce it to 0 percent.",
        "The discussion focused on the adverse impact of the crisis on GDP and on employment noting the heterogeneity of industries regarding the magnitude of the impact, the more rapid than expected path of recovery of economic activity in Israel and abroad against the background of the vaccination campaigns, the inflation environment, the developments regarding the exchange rate, and the financing limitations in the credit market.",
        "The effect on aggregate economic activity of the third lockdown, despite its length, was apparently more moderate than expected, and than that of the previous lockdowns.",
        "This can be seen in several rapid indicators of activity—mobility data, credit card purchases, and labor inputs.",
        "This moderate negative impact is apparently a direct result of the adjustment by the public and businesses, seen in, among other things, the rising trend of online purchases between each lockdown as indicated by credit card data.",
        "This is alongside the Israeli economy’s comparative advantage in the area of services exports for which global demand during the coronavirus crisis even increased (except for tourism), and particularly in the high tech industry which has continued to grow during the crisis.",
        "Despite the lockdown, GDP grew in the fourth quarter of 2020 by 6.3 percent several industries, and in the full year of 2020, GDP contracted by 2.4 percent, a smaller than expected contraction, which mainly reflected the adverse impact on private consumption (-9.4 percent).",
        "However, the relatively moderate negative impact in aggregate activity blurs the gaps in the effects of the crisis among the various sectors and industries in the economy, between those that were directly or indirectly negatively impacted by the limitations, and those less affected.",
        "The negative impact is not uniform across the firms, and as can bee seen in a CBS real time survey, larger firms are more resilient while the smaller are more vulnerable.",
        "In parallel, a gap opened between GDP data, which are relatively encouraging compared internationally, and the state of the labor market, where the broad unemployment rate in recent months has been very high; during the course of the second lockdown it was about 23 percent, declined to about 14 percent between the lockdowns, and at the beginning of the third lockdown it climbed to about 20 percent.",
        "This gap points to most of the unemployment in Israel being concentrated in industries that are characterized by low labor productivity and wage conditions, and emphasizes the differential adverse impact on different labor market industries at the height of the crisis.",
        "In view of this, the Committee members expressed concern over the effects of the crisis on inequality in the economy.",
        "Despite the low level of annual inflation, -0.4 percent, the inflation environment continues to increase, driven by global oil and commodity prices.",
        "The Committee members discussed the increase in inflation expectations, against the background of the accommodative policy and the rise in the global inflation environment, and in particular the increase in inflation expectations in the US.",
        "One-year inflation expectations from all sources increased and are around the lower bound of the target range.",
        "Expectations derived from the capital market for the first and second years forward increased markedly, and expectations for medium and longer terms remain anchored within the target range.",
        "The Committee members noted that despite the increase in inflation expectations for the short term, the expectations are still low, as is actual inflation.",
        "Therefore, the monetary policy will have to remain accommodative in order to support economic recovery.",
        "In terms of the forecast for continued recovery in Israel and worldwide, the high pace of vaccination as well as the effectiveness of the vaccines, increase the probability for a rapid recovery of the Israeli economy and the realization of the optimistic scenario in the Research Department’s forecast that was published in January.",
        "The IMF revised upward its growth and trade forecasts for advanced economies against the background of the vaccination process—in 2021, the global economy is expected to grow by 5.5 percent.",
        "Global economic data indicate continued recovery in view of the decline in the scope of morbidity worldwide—GDP data for the fourth quarter surprised to the upside in most countries, sentiment indices indicate continued recovery, purchasing managers indices in January continued to point to expansion in global activity, and world trade continued to grow.",
        "At the same time, in some countries the level of morbidity remains high; in Europe the morbidity level and continued lockdowns led to a marked contraction in GDP in 2020.",
        "The monetary policy in the main economies continued to be very accommodative and governments put additional fiscal programs into action.",
        "Equity prices continued to rise on global capital markets, while in the Israeli market prices rose strongly relative to other countries.",
        "The Committee members were of the opinion that these signs could indicate the desired exit from the global crisis, even if it is expected to be gradual.",
        "The program that the Bank of Israel announced on January 14, to purchase $30 billion in 2021, led to an immediate and relatively sharp depreciation of the shekel, but since then the shekel has strengthened slightly.",
        "From the Monetary Committee’s previous decision until January 14, the shekel strengthened by 3.2 percent in terms of the effective exchange rate.",
        "Following the Bank of Israel’s announcement regarding the scope of its intervention in the foreign exchange market in 2021, the shekel weakened by 5.2 percent, so that at the end of the period, the shekel had weakened by about 1.8 percent in terms of the effective exchange rate, by about 2 percent against the US dollar, and by about 0.6 percent against the euro.",
        "A continuation of this trend is expected to support export performance, the exit from the crisis, and a return of inflation to the target range.",
        "Most of the Committee members were of the view that the current extent of monetary accommodation, through its various tools, is sufficient for now, particularly in view of the additional tools used in the credit market, such as the payment deferral framework.",
        "They noted that the financial system is functioning in an orderly fashion, and that the various indicators do not point to severe credit distress.",
        "However, they noted that the small and micro business segment has encountered greater difficulty in raising credit.",
        "The Committee members noted that the interest rates in the economy have remained at low levels, despite the increase in credit risk, partly due to the policy measures taken by the Bank of Israel and the Ministry of Finance.",
        "Five of the Committee members were of the opinion that the interest rate should be left unchanged at 0.1 percent.",
        "These five Committee members thought that the low level of the interest rate supports a recovery of economic activity and a gradual return of inflation to the target range, particularly in view of the fact that the Bank of Israel is using other tools in the credit market and in the foreign exchange market.",
        "One Committee members voted in favor of lowering the interest rate to 0 percent.",
        "He believed that an interest rate lower than 0.1 percent is more appropriate due to the intensity of the crisis and the unusually intense impact on the employment level.",
        "He added that he does not rule out the possibility that a more accommodative policy and a move to a negative interest rate may be necessary in the future.",
        "The Committee decided to leave in place the other policy measures decided upon in the past.",
        "The Committee noted that the fast pace of the inoculation process in Israel increases the optimism regarding a rapid return of the economy to a path of growth in the coming year.",
        "However, the risks to economic activity remain high—mainly in view of the risk of additional morbidity waves due to the spread of the various mutations—and the adverse impact on the economy, and particularly on the labor market, is expected to be prolonged.The Committee will therefore continue to utilize a range of tools in order to increase the extent of monetary policy accommodation and to ensure the continued orderly functioning of the financial markets.",
        "The Committee will expand the use of the existing tools, including the interest rate tool, and will operate additional ones, to the extent that it assesses that it is necessary in order to achieve its monetary policy goals and to moderate the adverse economic impact resulting from the crisis.",
        "The Monetary Committee sets the interest rate in a process that includes two discussions––the first in a broad forum, and the second in a narrower one.",
        "In the broad-forum discussion, the relevant background economic conditions are presented, including the real and financial-monetary developments in Israel’s economy, and developments in the global economy.",
        "Participants in this discussion include the members of the Monetary Committee, senior representatives from the various departments of the Bank, and economists from the economic departments (Research and Markets), who prepare and present the material for discussion.",

        "A summary view of the economic situation available at the time of the Committee’s discussion is presented in the [notice regarding the interest rate decision, which was](https://www.boi.org.il/en/NewsAndPublications/PressReleases/Pages/24-2-2020.aspx) The members of the Monetary Committee participating in the discussion decide on the appropriate rate of interest.",
        "After the discussion, it was decided to keep the interest rate unchanged at 0.1 percent.",
        "In addition, the Committee decided to end the program providing long-term loans to the banking system against credit extended to small and micro businesses on October 1, 2021, or when NIS 40 billion have been utilized in the program.",
        "Both decisions were reached unanimously.",
        "The discussion focused on the possible factors in the increase of the inflation environment in Israel and the extent to which they are expected to persist over time, the global economy and monetary policy in various countries, the improvement in economic activity and the slow labor-market recovery, which is not uniform across the various sectors; the exchange rate; and the risks remaining despite the recovery of economic activity.",
        "The Committee discussed the increase in the inflation environment reflected in the year over year inflation rate entering the target range for the first time since the middle of US inflation indicates that a considerable portion of the rising prices is focused on a small number of CPI components.",
        "While most assessments are than the high inflation in the US is not expected to persist, the Committee was of the view that it remains difficult to determine how transitory the increase in Israel’s inflation is, but emphasized that inflation in Israel is much lower than in the US, and there is no concern of an outbreak of inflation.",
        "In a small number of economies (mostly developing markets) notable inflationary pressures were seen, which led to interest rate increases.",
        "However, the monetary policy in major economies remained very accommodative—major central banks kept interest rates unchanged and did not change purchase programs.",
        "The global economy can be seen to be continuing on an improving trend, with an increase in the share of vaccinated people—a development that helps to continue driving the Israeli economy forward, as it is a small open economy that is impacted by global developments.",
        "Available indicators of economic activity point to a continuation of the recovery that began with the exit from the third lockdown, although the level of activity, and primarily employment, remains lower than the pre-crisis levels.",
        "The broad unemployment rate declined, and the employment rate (excluding COVID-19 absentees) increased slightly.",
        "However, an analysis of labor market data indicates that the recovery is not uniform across the various sectors.",
        "In addition, the job vacancy rate is still at a high level.",
        "The main industries in which there is a shortage of workers are the restaurant and tourism industries, which were markedly adversely impacted by the crisis, as well as the construction industry.",
        "The Committee assessed that the recovery in the labor market is expected to continue, even if at a relatively moderate pace, and apparently a return to the unemployment rates of just before the crisis is expected to take a long time.",
        "A similar picture is conveyed at other countries, such as the US—a slow decline in unemployment, while the level of job vacancies remains high.",
        "The Committee discussed the risk of a renewed spread of the current coronavirus variant, and its possible impact on activity should the government be required to impose additional limitations.",
        "The Committee also discussed recent financial market developments and noted that corporate bond spreads are still at low levels, and since the beginning of the year there have been marked increases in equity indices in Israel and abroad.",
        "However, since the previous interest rate decision, equity prices and corporate bond spreads have remained without significant changes, corporate bond spreads are at a level similar to that of before the crisis, and government bond yields also remained stable.",
        "In addition, there was an acceleration in the increase in home prices—which increased in the past year at a relatively rapid pace of 5.6 percent.",
        "In contrast, the fiscal uncertainty declined, and will decline even further after the State budget is passed.",
        "Since the previous interest rate decision, the shekel weakened by 1.1 percent against the dollar, and strengthened by 0.6 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate and by 2.2 percent against the euro.",
        "In the Committee’s discussions, it was noted that the plan to purchase $30 billion in 2021 was a special program for a very special situation, which supported the economy’s dealing with the economic ramifications of the COVID-19 crisis.",
        "Since the publication of the program, morbidity around the world, and in Israel in particular, improved, the economy recovered at a solid pace, the employment situation was improved, and the inflation rate returned to the target range.",
        "It was noted that the intervention this year is not limited to $30 billion, and at the end of the program, the Bank will intervene in the foreign exchange market at its discretion, given the state of the economy.",
        "The Committee members assessed that the current extent of monetary accommodation, via a range of policy tools, is appropriate for now.",
        "The Committee will formulate its policy so that it will continue to provide macroeconomic support in the process of exiting the economic crisis, and will ensure that the credit market continues to function.",
        "However, with the removal of the limitations, and the recovery of the economy, the Committee members assessed that the need for a program to provide long-term loans to the banking system against credit extended to small and micro businesses declined, and the Committee decided unanimously that the operation of that program would be halted: the pillar of the program in which loans were extended to banks at an interest rate of -0.1 percent ended as planned in June, and regarding the pillar of loans extended at an interest rate of 0.1 percent, the Committee decided that it will end on October 1 or when the NIS 40 billion of the plan are utilized.",
        "The Committee members noted that the Committee will continue to examine market conditions constantly and will continue operating the other tools used in the crisis, as needed.",
        "All six members of the Monetary Committee were of the opinion that the interest rate should be kept unchanged at 0.1 percent.",
        "They were of the view that that the low level of the interest rate supports the continued recovery of economic activity.",
        "The Committee noted that the process of returning to routine in Israel supports rapid growth in the coming year.",
        "However, there are still challenges to activity, in view of the health risks in Israel and abroad and the adverse impact on the economy, particularly the labor market.",
        "The Committee will therefore continue to conduct very accommodative monetary policy for a prolonged time, using a range of tools as necessary, including the interest rate tool.",
        "This is in order to continue supporting he attainment of the policy targets, the economy’s recovery from the crisis, and ensuring the continued orderly functioning of the financial markets."

        "The Monetary Committee sets the interest rate in a process that includes two discussions––the first in a broad forum, and the second in a narrower one.",
        "In the broad-forum discussion, the relevant background economic conditions are presented, including the real and financial-monetary developments in Israel’s economy, and developments in the global economy.",
        "Participants in this discussion include the members of the Monetary Committee, senior representatives from the various departments of the Bank, and economists from the economic departments (Research and Markets), who prepare and present the material for discussion.",
        "In the narrow forum—which consists of the Monetary Committee and a representative of the Markets Department—the Research and the Markets Departments present their views of the main considerations that should guide the setting of the monetary policy.",
        "An open discussion on monetary policy follows, which ends with a vote on the level of the interest rate.",
        "According to Section 18(c) of the Bank of Israel Law, 5770–2010, the decision on the interest rate is reached by majority vote of the members of the Monetary Committee who participate in the voting.",
        "A summary view of the economic situation available at the time of the Committee’s discussion is presented in the [notice regarding the interest rate decision, which was](https://www.boi.org.il/en/NewsAndPublications/PressReleases/Pages/24-8-20b.aspx) The members of the Monetary Committee participating in the discussion decide on the appropriate rate of interest.",
        "After the discussion, it was decided to keep the interest rate unchanged at 0.1 percent.",
        "Five Committee members supported the proposal to keep the interest rate unchanged, and one Committee member supported the proposal to reduce it to 0 percent.",
        "The discussion focused primarily on the effects of the coronavirus crisis on Israel’s economy in the short and long terms, and on the policy required to reduce the scope of the adverse economic impact on businesses and households and to support an economic recovery that is as rapid as possible.",
        "The significant negative impact on the economy resulting from the coronavirus crisis that began in March, the process of economic recovery that began with the removal of the limitations, and the risk of deterioration in economic activity in view of the second wave of infections and the political uncertainty were the focus of the Monetary Committee’s discussions.",
        "The Committee discussed the status of the real economy.",
        "Based on the first estimate of National Accounts data for the second quarter of 2020, GDP contracted by 28.7 percent if not for the crisis.",
        "Most of the negative impact was in domestic activity—private consumption and investment—while the negative impact on exports was slightly more moderate.",
        "There was an increase in public consumption, against the background of the response of government policy to the crisis.",
        "An analysis of rapid indicators of activity shows that after a relatively rapid recovery in June, there was some slowdown in the pace of recovery in July and August.",
        "The level of credit card purchases in July was lower than the level forecast by data from recent years, but from the beginning of August there was an increase in purchases.",
        "Indices of mobility to workplaces moderated in July to up to 20–30 percent below their precrisis levels; in the beginning of August there was an increase in mobility to retail and recreation places.",
        "The Committee noted that considerable uncertainty remains both with regard to the development of the health situation and with regard to the date of the approval of the budget for 2021, which is liable to weigh on the continuation of the recovery.",
        "Although there is difficulty in precisely assessing the labor market situation in view of the variance in data from various sources, all the data still point to marked weakness.",
        "Based on Labor Force Surveys conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics, the “broad unemployment rate”, which includes the unemployed, those temporarily absent from work for reasons related to the Covid-19 crisis, and those dismissed from their positions between March and July who are not looking for work, is about 12 percent in July(for those aged 15 and above).",
        "The Research Department updated its macroeconomic forecast, to reflect two possible scenarios.",
        "In the relatively optimistic scenario, in which there is control over the pandemic, GDP is expected to contract by 4.5 percent in 2020, and to grow by 6 percent in 2021.",
        "Under this scenario, the deficit is expected to be 13.2 percent in 2020 and 8.2 percent in 2021, and the debt to GDP ratio is expected to be 75 percent in 2020 and 78 percent in 2021.",
        "In the more pessimistic scenario, where only partial control of the pandemic is achieved, GDP is expected to contract by 7 percent in 2020 and to grow by 3 percent in 2021.",
        "Under this scenario, the deficit is expected to be 14.6 percent in The Committee was presented with updates about the development of the coronavirus crisis around the world and its economic ramifications.",
        "The global economy contracted sharply in the second quarter.",
        "Investment houses forecast positive growth in the second half of the year, but for 2020 overall a marked contraction of GDP is expected in most economies.",
        "The removal of the lockdowns and the reduction of social distancing carried out by numerous countries led to some recovery, but the economy is far from returning to its level of just before the pandemic.",
        "The inflationary environment around the world remained low and far from central banks’ targets.",
        "Central banks in advanced economies continue to implement the special steps that were announced in view of the crisis.",
        "The Committee referred to the inflation environment which remains low.",
        "The CPI for June declined by 0.1 percent and the CPI for July increased by 0.2 percent, and over the preceding 12 months, the inflation rate was -0.6 percent, compared with a rate of -1.6 percent at the time of the previous interest rate decision.",
        "The main contribution to the increase in year over year inflation was from the rise in fuel prices, which reduced the negative contribution of the energy component in the CPI.",
        "In the CPI net of energy, fruit and vegetables, there was inflation of -0.4 percent, similar to the level of previous months.",
        "There is a methodological difficulty in calculating the Consumer Price Index as long as the limitations on economic activity lead to certain products and services not being consumed and thus their prices not being able to be measured, and there is a change in households’ consumption basket.",
        "However, an analysis conducted by the Research Department indicates that it appears that the change in the composition of the consumption basket has not yet had a major impact on the inflation rate actually experienced by households, and it is close to the official inflation rate.",
        "Inflation expectations for the coming year from all sources remained below the lower bound of the target.",
        "In the coming months, the year over year inflation rate is expected to remain negative.",
        "Medium-term forward inflation expectations increased, so that inflation expectations at the end of the second year are slightly below the lower bound of the target, and expectations for longer terms are within the target range.",
        "The Committee discussed developments in the foreign exchange market.",
        "Since the previous interest rate decision, the shekel weakened by 0.6 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate, while strengthening by approximately 1 percent against the dollar, and weakening by 3.5 percent against the euro.",
        "The exchange rate and its impact on exports, employment and economic activity, and the return of the inflation rate to the target remain a focus of the Committee’s discussions and policy decisions.",
        "The Committee discussed developments in Israel’s capital markets.",
        "An improvement can be seen in the functioning of the credit market, with stability in interest rates, supported by the Bank of Israel’s steps and the government-guaranteed credit funds.",
        "The Business Tendency Survey points to some moderation in companies’ credit constraints, but the limitation is still higher than before the crisis.",
        "The Committee was of the opinion that there is not a broad credit constraint in the economy and that in general the credit market itself is functioning appropriately.",
        "However, there are indications of credit difficulties concentrated in certain industries and in small companies.",
        "Government bond yields remained low, and it appears that the Bank of Israel’s intervention in the corporate bond market, which began in July, contributed to a marked decline in spreads on the main Tel Bond indices.",
        "Equity market prices rose in line with the global trend.",
        "Within the framework of the discussion, the Committee referred to the mechanism of the intervention tools available to it.",
        "Since the onset of the crisis, the Committee has implemented a range of steps, to enhance the extent of monetary-policy accommodation, to ensure the continued orderly activity of financial markets and to support the mechanism of monetary pass-through to credit in the economy.",
        "The Committee discussed a number of alternatives regarding monetary steps that can be implemented at this time in view of the situation in the economy.",
        "It was noted that the tools that the Committee is utilizing at this time are providing a response to the needs of the economy.",
        "Five Committee members were of the opinion that the interest rate should be kept at its current level of 0.1 percent.",
        "They were of the opinion that this low interest rate level supports the recovery of economic activity and the gradual return of the inflation rate to within the target range, and particularly in view of the Bank of Israel operating additional tools in the credit market.",
        "One Committee member voted in favor of reducing the interest rate to 0 percent.",
        "He was of the opinion that an interest rate lower than 0.1 percent is more appropriate due to the magnitude of the crisis and the adverse impact, anomalous in its magnitude, on the employment level.",
        "The Monetary Committee sets the interest rate in a process that includes two discussions––the first in a broad forum, and the second in a narrower one.",

        "Five Committee members supported the proposal to keep the interest rate unchanged, and one Committee member supported the proposal to reduce it to 0 percent.",
        "The discussion focused on the path of recovery of economic activity in the exit process from the second lockdown, on economic developments worldwide, the development of the exchange rate and the inflation environment, as well as on the state of financial markets and the efficient functioning of the credit market.",
        "The Monetary Committee discussed the economic ramifications of the economy’s exit process from the second lockdown.",
        "The data and indicators available regarding activity in October and November (data on credit card expenditures, mobility, electricity usage, the Business Tendency Survey) show an improvement in activity just before the second lockdown, and that the adverse impact on economic activity during the lockdown was moderate compared to the adverse impact of the first lockdown.",
        "However, it appears that the return of economic activity in the exit from the second lockdown is slower, due to the gradual easing of limitations.",
        "In particular, it was noted that there is considerable uncertainty regarding the continued exit from the lockdown and regarding the possibility of renewed limitations, in view of the increase in morbidity and the infection coefficient, R, being greater than 1.",
        "Real-time surveys by the Central Bureau of Statistics indicate that some industries adjusted their activity to the new environment and thus succeeded in moderating its negative impact—for example, businesses that increased their supply of products online and via deliveries, mainly in the retail trade and food industries.",
        "However, there is variance in the negative impact on the various industries, with businesses and employees in industries such as tourism, restaurants, education and leisure adversely impacted significantly and for a longer time.",
        "The Committee had an extensive discussion on the labor market situation.",
        "The second lockdown led to a sharp increase in the broadly defined unemployment rate, which reached approximately 23 percent of the labor force in the first half of October, compared to approximately 11 percent in the first half of September.",
        "The increase derived mainly from an increase in the number of workers temporarily absent from their workplace.",
        "In the second half of October, with the beginning of the easing of the lockdown, the rate moderated to approximately 18 percent.",
        "The cumulative extent of the crisis is beginning to be felt in the labor market and is reflected in an increase in the number of people laid off due to businesses being closed.",
        "A real-time survey conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics in October indicates that there is an increase in the unemployment rate compared with the survey conducted in August.",
        "Committee members expressed concern that the coronavirus crisis will have adverse ramifications on inequality in the economy, and noted that the handling of that is primarily from the fiscal policy side.",
        "The Committee was updated regarding developments in the global economy.",
        "The global economy recovered in the third quarter and higher than expected growth was recorded in most economies, though the renewed spread of infection and the expansion of lockdowns and limitations in advanced economies are expected to lead to a moderation in global growth in the fourth quarter.",
        "However, the increase in the probability of a vaccine in the beginning of 2021 already, is expected to contribute to an improvement in the economic recovery next year, and contributed to a positive trend in the markets and to an increase in the price of oil.",
        "World trade is recovering after having declined sharply in the beginning of the crisis.",
        "In October, the inflation rate declined in all the regions and it is expected to remain low in 2021 as well.",
        "The monetary policy around the world continues to be very accommodative.",
        "Central banks of major economies emphasized their commitment to maintaining the accommodative policy for a considerable time, and governments continue to adopt steps for assistance and fiscal expansion.",
        "The Committee discussed the development of the real and nominal exchange rate of the shekel in recent years.",
        "In recent months, the effective exchange rate hovered in a relatively narrow range, but since the previous interest rate decision, the shekel strengthened by approximately 1 percent in terms of the effective exchange rate and by dollar worldwide.",
        "In addition, the assessment was raised that continued appreciation is liable to adversely impact exports, and is expected to act toward an additional slowing of inflation.",
        "The Committee discussed the inflation environment and the decline in it in view of the coronavirus crisis.",
        "The inflation rate in the past 12 months is -0.8 percent (-0.4 percent net of energy and fruit and vegetables).",
        "Inflation expectations for the coming year from all sources remained below the lower bound of the target range, but expectations derived from the capital market increased.",
        "Forward inflation expectations for the second year returned to within the target range, and expectations for longer terms remained anchored within the target.",
        "An analysis presented by the Research Department indicated that the crisis has had a moderating influence on most inflation components.",
        "The Committee discussed the effects of the steps by the Bank of Israel and the Ministry of Finance on the easing of the terms of credit in the economy and the availability of credit.",
        "Interest rates on credit have been stable since the beginning of the crisis, and interest rates on credit to small and micro companies are even a bit lower than before the crisis.",
        "The Business Tendency Survey indicates that there has been a decline in the difficulty for large and medium sized businesses to raise credit, while among small companies the difficulty in raising bank credit remains in place.",
        "The effect of the extension of the framework for deferring households’ loans was discussed.",
        "The Committee discussed the Research Department’s updated forecast, which describes of 4.5 percent in GDP is expected if there is no significant backtracking in removing the limitations by the end of the year (the “control scenario”), and a contraction of 5 percent if there is such backtracking due to an increase in morbidity.",
        "Some of the Committee members assessed that the contraction in GDP will be even lower if the control scenario materializes.",
        "The Research Department assesses that in 2021, there is still a high level of uncertainty regarding the forecast, in view of the increase in R, the infection coefficient, recently, and the probability of entering into additional lockdowns, in contrast to the probability of a vaccine during the course of 2021.",
        "The forecast published in October, which contains a “control scenario” and a “low control scenario” still covers the range of possibilities expected by the Department for 2021.",
        "The Committee noted that the positive results in trials for a coronavirus vaccine increase the optimism regarding a rapid return of the economy to growth in the coming year.",
        "However, the adverse impact on the economy, and particularly on the labor market, is expected to be prolonged, and the Committee will therefore continue to utilize a range of tools in order to increase the extent of the monetary policy accommodation and to ensure the continued orderly functioning of the financial markets.",
        "The Committee will expand the use of the existing tools, including the interest rate tool, and will operate additional ones, to the extent that it assesses that it is necessary in order to achieve the monetary policy goals and to moderate the adverse economic impact resulting from the crisis.",
        "Five Committee members were of the opinion that the interest rate should be kept at its current level of 0.1 percent.",
        "They were of the opinion that this low interest rate level supports the recovery of economic activity and the gradual return of the inflation rate to within the target range, and particularly in view of the Bank of Israel operating additional tools in the credit market and the foreign exchange market.",
        "One Committee member voted in favor of reducing the interest rate to 0 percent.",
        "He was of the opinion that an interest rate lower than 0.1 percent is more appropriate due to the magnitude of the crisis and the adverse impact, anomalous in its magnitude, on the employment level.",
        "The Monetary Committee sets the interest rate in a process that includes two discussions––the first in a broad forum, and the second in a narrower one.",
        "In the broad-forum discussion, the relevant background economic conditions are presented, including the real and financial-monetary developments in Israel’s economy, and developments in the global economy.",
        "Participants in this discussion include the members of the Monetary Committee, senior representatives from the various departments of the Bank, and economists from the economic departments (Research and Markets), who prepare and present the material for discussion.",
        "In the narrow forum—which consists of the Monetary Committee and a representative of the Markets Department—the Research and the Markets Departments present their views of the main considerations that should guide the setting of the monetary policy.",
        "An open discussion on monetary policy follows, which ends with a vote on the level of the interest rate.",

        "A summary view of the economic situation available at the time of the Committee’s discussion is presented in the [notice regarding the interest rate decision, which was](https://www.boi.org.il/en/NewsAndPublications/PressReleases/Pages/25-05-2020.aspx) The members of the Monetary Committee participating in the discussion decide on the appropriate rate of interest.",
        "After the discussion, it was decided to keep the interest rate unchanged at 0.1 percent.",
        "Five Committee members supported the proposal to keep the interest rate unchanged, and one Committee member supported the proposal to reduce it to 0 percent.",
        "The discussion focused primarily on the effects of the coronavirus crisis on Israel’s economy in the short and long terms, and on the policy required to reduce the scope of the adverse economic impact on businesses and households and to support an economic recovery that is as rapid as possible.",
        "The significant negative impact on the economy as a result of the coronavirus crisis that began in March, and the process of economic recovery due to the gradual removal of the limitations imposed by the government on economic activity, were the focus of the Monetary Committee’s discussions.",
        "The Committee was presented with updates regarding the coronavirus crisis’s development around the world and its expected economic ramifications.",
        "The Committee members discussed the assessments of international institutions and investment houses, which forecast a contraction of global output in 2020 and a sharp decline in the scope of world trade.",
        "The assessments were revised downward and they indicate that the recession will reach its peak during the second quarter and that the service sector will be the most adversely impacted.",
        "Due to the easing of limitations in various countries, a process of global economic recovery is expected to begin, though the level of uncertainty in the forecasts is particularly high.",
        "The Committee analyzed the risks existing in the global economy and under the various scenarios published by the international institutions.",
        "The Committee discussed the main policy measures by central banks and governments worldwide.",
        "The significant fiscal expansionary steps taken around the world include extensive plans for expanding public expenditure, compensation for those negatively impacted by the crisis, and the extension of credit to the business sector.",
        "Central banks have taken unprecedented monetary policy steps and interest rates are expected to remain low for a prolonged period of time.",
        "Central banks’ balances sheet increased markedly due to a range of accommodative steps and the provision of liquidity to markets, which apparently led to an easing in financial terms, and thus to the sharp declines in equity markets being partly offset and government bond markets around the world stabilizing.",
        "The Committee referred to the picture of the real economic situation.",
        "Based on the first estimate of National Accounts data, GDP contracted by 7.1 percent in the first quarter, due to the shutdown of the economy beginning in the middle of March.",
        "It was noted that in view of the difficulty in assessing the changes in activity during the crisis period, the exact numbers should be referred to with caution, though there is no doubt that the negative impact on the economy is significant.",
        "The Committee attempted to assess the extent of the economy’s recovery, as indicated by the quantitative assessment of the impact of the health-related limitations on the contraction of activity in various industries, and by various indicators of activity and its components and by the qualitative information provided by business surveys conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics.",
        "The Research Department assessed that due to the removal of the limitations, the share of the economy’s shutdown declined markedly since the peak of the crisis, from 36 percent of economic activity shut down in the first half of April to approximately 19 percent of economic activity shut down in the middle of May.",
        "Rapid indicators of economic activity, such as credit card expenditures, the public’s mobility, and electricity usage, point to recovery in some industries, though the level of activity remains low, and in industries in which the main limitations have not yet been removed, activity is still close to the lowest point.",
        "Regarding the housing market, preliminary indicators were presented, showing a marked decline in the scope of transactions in March–April.",
        "The Committee discussed the magnitude of the negative impact in the labor market and the effect of removing the limitations on the developments in it, but concluded that it is difficult to quantify the developments precisely, as the administrative reports regarding employment become available with a lag and it is difficult to receive from the Central Bureau of Statistics surveys a precise picture of the scope of the effect of the crisis on actual employment.",
        "The Committee emphasized the importance of the rapid handling of unemployment and labor market problems.",
        "The Committee also referred to the crisis’s effect on households in various deciles—it adversely impacted households from the lower deciles notably more significantly, as the probability of those households remaining without a wage-earner is higher.",
        "The Committee members discussed the ramifications of the strengthening of the shekel since the previous interest rate decision, and its return to a level similar to that prior to the crisis (in effective exchange rate terms).",
        "They raised the concern that it would weigh on a recovery of exports, particularly in view of the decline in global demand, and on the return of inflation to the target range.",
        "The Committee referred to the decline in the inflation environment in recent months, during the crisis and in continuation of that trend.",
        "In April, 12-month inflation was negative 0.6 percent, primarily due to the notable negative contribution of the energy component, but even in 12-month inflation measured by the change in the CPI excluding energy and fruit and vegetables, the downward trend continued, and in April it was 0.2 percent.",
        "The housing component in the CPI declined by 0.2 percent in April.",
        "One-year inflation expectations are still below the target, while expectations for medium and long terms are within the target range.",
        "It was emphasized that in view of the crisis, there is a methodological difficulty in calculating the CPI and in analyzing the meaning of the measured change in prices.",
        "The Committee discussed the developments in capital markets in Israel, where sharp declines in equity markets were partly offset and government bond markets stabilized.",
        "The Bank of Israel’s activity in financial markets markedly reduced the yield on government and corporate bonds in Israel, despite the growth of the government deficit and in business credit risk.",
        "The Committee discussed credit market developments.",
        "Bank credit increased during the crisis, primarily in view of the growth in business credit and in mortgages, but in general, the scope of credit to small businesses and consumer credit contracted, partly due to the decline in activity and in demand for credit and partly against the background of the increased risk of small businesses that are active in industries that were negatively impacted by the crisis.",
        "The Business Tendency Survey also indicates an increase in companies’ financing difficulties.",
        "In contrast, the banks deferred, for several months, loan repayments for nearly half a million businesses and households, at a total scope of NIS 6.2 billion.",
        "The activity of the funds for extending partially government-guaranteed credit to small and medium sized businesses led to a decline in the average interest rate charged to small businesses.",
        "After a halt in bond market issues in March, there was a recovery in the scope of issues in April and May.",
        "The Committee members discussed the special update to the Research Department’s macroeconomic staff forecast, which was published in April, and that now forecasts contraction of 4.5 percent in 2020 GDP (compared to a contraction of 5.3 percent in the April forecast) in view of the rapid removal of the limitations, relative to the assessment in April.",
        "The forecast projects a growth rate of 6.8 percent in 2021 (compared to 8.7 percent in the April forecast), due to the assessment of the slower recovery due to social distancing, and limitations such as the Purple Badge, which were not fully assessed in the April forecast.",
        "The unemployment rate in the second half of 2020 is expected to increase to 8.5 percent (compared to 8 percent), and to be 5.5 percent at the end of 2021 scenario than the baseline one, which reflects a second wave of infection in Israel and abroad.",
        "The Committee discussed the exceptional uncertainty regarding the healthrelated and economic scenarios expected in Israel and abroad, and the uncertainty regarding the fiscal policy expected to be adopted in a case of the crisis being extended.",
        "The data and assessments that were available to the Committee indicated, as noted, that the economy entered a severe crisis in view of the coronavirus outbreak, a crisis that was reflected in difficulties in the capital markets and in the notable economic distress among businesses and households.",
        "They emphasized that the Bank of Israel took determined steps at the outbreak of the crisis in order to support the orderly conduct of the capital market and the functioning of the government bond, corporate bond and foreign exchange markets, and that there is a need to continue to follow these markets and to adopt new activities or to expand the existing activities, as needed.",
        "Five Committee members were of the opinion that the interest rate should be kept at its current level of 0.1 percent.",
        "They noted that the low interest rate, together with the additional monetary tools operated by the Bank of Israel, at this time support convenient credit terms all along the curve.",
        "One Committee member voted in favor of reducing the interest rate to 0 percent.",
        "He was of the opinion that an interest rate lower than 0.1 percent is more appropriate due to the magnitude of the crisis and the adverse impact, anomalous in its magnitude, on the employment level.",
        "The Committee members emphasized that they will expand the use of existing tools including the interest rate tool, and will operate additional ones, to the extent that they assesses that the crisis is lengthening and that it is necessary in order to achieve the monetary policy goals and to moderate the negative economic impact created as a result of the crisis.",

        "The significant negative impact on the economy as a result of the coronavirus crisis that began in March, the process of economic recovery that began with the removal of the limitations, and the risk of deterioration in economic activity in view of the increase in infection rates, were the focus of the Monetary Committee’s discussions.",
        "The Committee discussed the status of the real economy.",

        "The Research Department updated its macroeconomic forecast.",

        "Inflation expectations for the coming 12 months, from all sources, were higher in June than in May, but the developments during the period were uneven: inflation expectations derived from the capital market declined, while professional forecaster’s projections increased slightly after the CPI was published.",

        "The Committee discussed foreign exchange market developments.",
        "Since the previous interest rate decision, the shekel strengthened by about 1.2 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate; the exchange rate is delaying the return of inflation to the target range and is weighing on the recovery of exports.",

        "The discussion referred to various aspects that justify intervention, while distinguishing between a situation of a market failure and intervention intended to help reduce issuance costs.",
        "It was established that as of now, there is no market failure but there is room for a plan that will strengthen the passthrough from the monetary interest rate to overall interest rates in the market, will encourage the issuance of credit to the business sector, and will make funds available for credit to all segments in the economy.",

        "The discussion focused primarily on the short- and long-term ramifications of the corona pandemic on the Israeli economy, and on the policy required in order to minimize the economic damage to businesses and households and support the recovery of the economy as quickly as possible.",
        "While the Monetary Committee’s discussions prior to deciding on the interest rate were the first such scheduled discussions following the worsening of the corona crisis, they took place following a series of discussions that the Committee held regarding the necessary monetary policy, during which a The Monetary Committee’s discussions focused on the significant worsening of the corona crisis during March.",
        "As part of this crisis, the government is making on-going decisions on the appropriate actions with the aim of mitigating public infection from the spread of the disease.",
        "These decisions have broad implications for Israel’s economy.",
        "Many other countries are going through a similar process, which differs based on each country’s characteristics, and the contraction of their activity has implications for the Israeli economy.",
        "With the exception of current data from the financial markets and some forecasts, the data available to the Committee were up to date as of January and February pandemic.",
        "The Committee discussed the real economic situation as shown in the qualitative information from the business surveys conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics and the Bank of Israel, and in the quantitative assessment of the effects of health restrictions on reducing activity in various areas.",

        "These estimations show that in the first quarter, the economy contracted by about 5 percent relative to the previous quarter (in quarterly terms).",
        "The Committee discussed the findings of the Bank of Israel’s Companies Survey, which indicate a sharp decline in the net balance of the business sector, and the industry net balances from the Central Bureau of Statistics Business Tendency Survey, which also show a significant decline in all industries.",
        "The Committee members discussed the assessments of international organizations and investment houses, which expect a contraction of global GDP in 2020 and a sharp decline in world trade.",
        "The Committee discussed the sentiment indices, which indicate contraction in economic activity in the advanced economies, and the data in China, which show a gradual return of economic activity thanks to the slowdown in the spread of the virus, which has allowed the authorities to reduce the restrictions on the populace.",
        "The Committee discussed the fact that the spread of the crisis has led to a sharp policy reaction by central banks and governments.",
        "Most of the central banks have lowered interest rates sharply and taken a variety of accommodative steps to supply liquidity to the markets.",
        "Governments have declared wide-scale programs to expand public expenditure, compensate victims of the crisis, and extend credit to the business sector.",
        "The slowdown in economic activity has led to a sharp decline in commodity prices, and the price of oil dropped by dozens of percent, also against the background of the lack of agreement between the major oil-producing countries regarding a cut in output.",
        "The Committee members discussed the Research Department’s staff forecast, which holds that, assuming that there is no further worsening of the restrictions in Israel, and that most of the restrictions blocking economic activity will be gradually removed until the end of June, the economy is expected to contract by 5.3 percent.",
        "The unemployment rate in the second half of the year (following the removal of the restrictions) among the primary working ages will by about 8 percent under this scenario.",
        "The Committee members emphasized that notwithstanding the assessment in this scenario that rapid growth is expected in 2021, the unemployment rate is expected to return to the low levels that were prevalent prior to the crisis only toward the end of 2021.",
        "A more pessimistic scenario might take place, according to which a delay in the removal of the restrictions would lead to a sharper contraction of GDP in 2020—8.8 percent—and an unemployment rate that is 2 percentage points higher on average.",
        "The Committee discussed the shake-up of the capital markets in Israel and abroad during March.",
        "The stock indices in the major markets dropped by around 30 percent, and most of them offset part of that decline thereafter.",
        "Yields in the government and corporate bond markets were very volatile, and there was a sharp increase in the risk indices.",
        "In Israel, the Tel Aviv 35 index declined by about 25 percent, and the sharp increase in government bond yields and in corporate bond spreads was halted after the announcement of the Bank of Israel’s measures in the bond market and the halt in the trend of withdrawals from the mutual funds, which had reached NIS 8 billion per day at its peak.",
        "The Committee members also discussed the anomalous volatility in the exchange rate during March, against the background of the liquidity distress in the foreign exchange market in view of the sharp declines in global equity markets.",
        "From the previous interest rate decision through March 17, the shekel weakened by 11 percent in terms of the effective exchange rate, but after the Bank of Israel instituted dollar/shekel swap transactions, the volatility declined and the weakening of the shekel moderated to 3.4 percent since the previous interest rate decision.",
        "The Committee members were of the opinion that the depreciation is expected to help exports, particularly manufacturing exports, and to offset the downward forces on inflation.",
        "The inflation environment has declined in recent months.",
        "This decline began even before the outbreak of the corona crisis, and when the crisis began, there was a further sharp decline in one-year inflation expectations.",
        "The expectations derived from the capital market, and expectations from the other sources decline, partly as a result of the sharp decline in global oil prices.",
        "However, longer-term expectations did not change significantly.",
        "The Committee members discussed the expectation that the negative impact to the production chain of many products may lead to an increase in prices from the supply side, and that the effect of the decline in demand is apparently more significant and will lead to a decline in inflation in the coming months.",
        "However, in the short term, there is expected to be some difficulty in measuring inflation, which is reflected in particular in the 27 percent of CPI components where activity was near zero in March.",
        "The data and assessments available to the Committee showed, as stated, that the economy entered a serious crisis in view of the spread of the corona virus, with the crisis reflected in difficulties in the capital market and significant economic distress among businesses and households.",
        "The Committee members were of the opinion that monetary policy must focus on supporting the proper activity of the capital market, particularly the functioning of the government and corporate bond markets, and the need to ease the economic distress of businesses and households.",
        "In view of the uncertainty in decision-making due to the dependence on actual infection data from the virus, a discussion was held regarding the appropriate policy under various assumptions about the duration of the crisis.",
        "In this context, it was noted that the two scenarios included in the Research Department’s staff forecast were compiled on the basis of the information available at the time the discussion was held, and that other scenarios may develop later on as a function of the exit strategy and of actual developments.",
        "Therefore, the Committee was of the opinion that its decisions must also take into account the possibility that a more pessimistic scenario than the Research Department’s basic scenario may play out, and the support for demand in the economy that will be necessary when the health restrictions are removed.",
        "The Committee members emphasized that in view of the serious crisis, it is important that monetary policy lead to an easement of credit terms in the form of lowering the interest rate along the entire curve.",
        "While the Bank of Israel’s measures in the bond market are lowering the medium- and longterm interest rates, many households and businesses are also exposed to the short-term interest rate, particularly those who borrow at variable rates.",
        "Therefore, five of the Committee’s members were of the opinion that the interest rate should be lowered to 0.1 percent.",
        "One Committee member voted for lowering the interest rate to 0 percent.",
        "He was of the opinion that the intensity of the crisis and the exceptionally intense negative impact to employment require an interest rate lower than 0.1 percent, the level that was prevalent for a long period when employment in the economy was full.",
        "The Committee members agreed that action must be taken to increase the pass-through from the low interest rate set by the Committee to the interest rates that the banks charge on loans to a variety of borrowers in the economy.",
        "Therefore, the Committee decided unanimously to put a new instrument into action, through which the Bank of Israel will extend monetary loans to the banks, totaling NIS 5 billion, for a term of three years, with a fixed interest rate of 0.1 percent.",
        "The loans are contingent upon extending credit to small and micro businesses.",
        "This tool is intended to ensure that the low level of the interest rate will also be reflected in the price of loans extended to these businesses.",
        "The Committee also decided unanimously to expand the program under which repo transactions are conducted vis-à-vis financial entities, such that the transactions will also be able to include corporate bonds as collateral (in addition to transactions with government bonds as collateral pursuant to the program announced on March 16).",
        "The Committee members were of the opinion that this step will strengthen the program’s support of liquidity and of the orderly functioning of the Israeli bond markets.",
        "The Committee members emphasized that they will expand the use of existing tools, including the interest rate tool, and will be able to operate additional tools, to the extent that the crisis lengthens and it is necessary in order to achieve the monetary policy goals and to moderate the negative economic impact resulting from the crisis.",
        "The Monetary Committee sets the interest rate in a process that includes two discussions––the first in a broad forum, and the second in a narrower one.",

        "After the discussion, it was decided to keep the interest rate unchanged at 0.25 percent.",
        "Five Committee members supported the proposal to keep the interest rate unchanged, and one Committee member supported the proposal to reduce it to 0.1 percent.",
        "The discussion focused primarily on the inflation environment in Israel, the exchange rate, economic activity, and the risks to global and domestic growth in view of the spread of the coronavirus.",
        "Other than current data from the financial markets and some of the forecasts, the data available to the Committee were up-to-date as of the fourth quarter of 2019, and some to January 2020, and were therefore not affected by the implications of the spread of the coronavirus.",
        "The Committee discussed the situation as shown by the data, and also discussed developments and assessments in connection with the effects of the spread of the virus, as known during the discussion on February 24.",
        "The Committee discussed the uncertainty and risks to global economic activity.",
        "The data indicated low growth in Europe and negative growth in Japan, while the American economy continues to show strength.",
        "It was noted that the global political risks have declined in view of the progress in trade talks between the US and China and the progress in the Brexit process, but the slowdown in world trade that began before the outbreak of the coronavirus has continued.",
        "The Committee members noted that the global growth forecasts were revised slightly downward, and there was a more significant revision regarding China.",
        "According to the assessments of most global financial institutions, if the spread of the virus is contained in the coming months, the damage to the global economy will be limited in scope and will take place mainly in the first quarter of 2020.",
        "Assessments are that in such a case, the virus will mainly affect demand and the production and supply chain.",
        "The Committee noted that until recently, the reactions of the global capital markets to the spread of the virus was moderate.",
        "However, in the days preceding the discussion, in view of the continued spread of the virus to additional regions, there were sharp price declines, and government bond yields declined due to assessments that the central banks may adopt more accommodative monetary policies.",
        "The Committee also discussed the drop in oil prices and in goods indices that took place in parallel with the drop in demand in China.",
        "The Committee members agreed that there was tremendous uncertainty regarding the extent to which the virus would affect global activity and trade, but it is clear that the risks tend to be heavy.",
        "The Committee discussed developments that occurred in the inflation environment in recent months.",
        "The Committee members noted that the year over year inflation rate remained low after the CPI reading for January surprised slightly to the downside.",
        "They emphasized that the index excluding volatile items—energy and fruits and vegetables— indicates a similar inflation environment.",
        "However, it was agreed that the moderating inflation does not reflect weakness in demand, and is affected to a large extent by the appreciation of the shekel.",
        "The Committee members said that 1-year inflation expectations from most sources declined, mainly in view of the further strengthening of the shekel and the decline in oil prices.",
        "The Committee’s assessment was that in the coming months, year over year inflation is expected to decline further, before moving back toward the lower bound of the target.",
        "In this context, the Committee members’ assessment was that one-year inflation expectations also include expectations of price increases due to the possibility that there may be an increase in VAT.",
        "The Committee members noted that medium- and long-term expectations remained stable since the previous interest rate decision, and that inflation expectations for 5–10 years, net of the inflation risk premium, are at the midpoint of the target range.",
        "The Committee members discussed the appreciation of the shekel and the fact that the shekel was notable in its strengthening relative to most currencies since the previous interest rate decision.",
        "The Committee’s assessment was that this development is weighing on the return of inflation toward the target.",
        "The Committee members noted that since the previous interest rate decision, the Bank of Israel intervened significantly in the foreign exchange market.",
        "The Committee members discussed the impact of Israel being added to the WGBI index.",
        "They emphasized that the Bank of Israel is prepared to prevent an excessive appreciation of the shekel by purchasing foreign exchange as necessary, particularly if the appreciation is due to factors of a financial nature.",
        "With regard to economic activity, the Committee’s assessment was that the economy will continue growing at around its potential pace.",
        "While the relatively high growth rate in the fourth quarter was impacted by volatility in vehicle imports, growth was still 3.7 percent in the second half of the year as a whole.",
        "The Committee's position was that growth was balanced in 2019.",
        "Growth in the fourth quarter encompassed all uses except for investment in residential construction.",

        "Most recent data showed a decline in the unemployment rate and that the participation rate and the employment rate remained high.",
        "The Committee members noted that the increase in the nominal wage continues despite some decline in its rate of increase.",
        "Most Committee members agreed that the initial indicators of activity in the first quarter—including the Business Tendency Survey and the Composite State of the Economy Index—support the assessment that the economy continues to grow strongly.",
        "In contrast, some of the members noted that health tax data indicated moderation.",
        "The Committee members emphasized the uncertainty regarding the effect of the spread of the coronavirus on activity in Israel.",
        "Their assessment was that if the crisis does not persist or spill over into additional countries, and particularly if significant preventative measures are not required in Israel, no significant impact is expected on macroeconomic activity in Israel.",
        "However, even under such a scenario, some harm is possible to some industries such as the construction and tourism industries.",
        "They added that if the crisis persists and becomes worse, there may be a greater impact in Israel.",
        "The Committee members emphasized that the basic market conditions put the Israeli economy in a good position relative to the world.",
        "They also emphasized that the Committee has a variety of tools to expand monetary accommodation if necessary.",
        "The Committee also discussed the effects of fiscal uncertainty, in view of the continued political uncertainty and the effects of deficit reduction measures.",
        "After a discussion, five Committee members were of the opinion that the interest rate should be kept at its current level.",
        "The data available to the Committee showed that the economy continues to grow at close to its potential rate, the labor market remains tight, inflation is low but is expected to begin converging toward the target range in about a year, and as such, the interest rate can be left at its current position.",
        "However, they added that in view of the inflation environment and the risks to activity due to the continued spread of the coronavirus, the Bank will continue intervening in the foreign exchange market or will use additional monetary tools as necessary in order to increase the scope of accommodation of monetary policy.",
        "In contrast, one Committee member voted in favor of reducing the interest rate to 0.1 percent.",
        "He claimed that the cumulative appreciation is liable to adversely impact economic activity and to act toward a continued decline in inflation, which in any case is at a low level.",
        "In addition, according to that same Committee member, the moderation of economic activity worldwide is a significant risk that, together with the expected impact of the fiscal contraction, requires an enhancement of the level of monetary accommodation.",
        "This Committee member did not reject the possibility that it may be necessary to lower the interest rate even below 0.1 percent.",
        "The Committee members were of the opinion that in view of the inflation environment in Israel, the monetary policies of major central banks worldwide, the moderation in the global economy, and the continued appreciation of the shekel, it will be necessary to leave the interest rate at its current level for a prolonged period or to reduce it, in order to support a process at the end of which inflation will stabilize around the midpoint of the target range, and so that the economy will continue to grow strongly.",
        "Moreover, the Committee members noted that the Committee is taking additional steps as necessary to make monetary policy more accommodative."

        "Five Committee members supported the proposal to keep the interest rate unchanged, and one Committee member supported increasing the interest rate to 0.25 percent.",
        "The discussion focused on several main issues: (1) real economic activity; (2) inflation, (3) the global environment and the exchange rate, (4) the housing market. '",
        "Main points of discussion In their discussion on economic activity, the Committee members discussed National Accounts data for the first quarter of 2018 indicating growth at a solid pace of 4.2 percent in annual terms.",
        "Several activity indicators, such as the Composite State of the Economy Index and the Business Tendency Survey, show the economy continuing to grow at an adequate pace that is in line with the potential growth rate.",
        "In contrast, there has been a prolonged decline (over four quarters) in residential construction.",
        "The Committee members discussed growth of exports (primarily the services component, but also the goods component) and said that it contributed to a more balanced composition of growth.",
        "The Committee referred as well to labor market data, which continue to indicate a tight labor market—record high employment and participation rates, a low in unemployment, and business sector wages returning to increase at a more rapid pace after some slowing in preceding months.",
        "The Committee noted that the inflation environment is still low, adding that it has been on a trend of some growth in recent months: core inflation indices are slightly above actual inflation, and expectations derived from the various sources have been on an upward trend and are nearing the target range.",
        "The Committee referred to both the GDP deflator and wages being on an upward trend; this supports actual inflation and is likely to create a dynamic of increases, which is expected to support the return of inflation to within the target range.",
        "The Committee members noted that certain factors can delay the return of inflation to the target at this time, including (1) the decline in oil prices—in recent days there was a decline, and if it continues it is likely to slow inflation, and (2) increased competition—competition has been enhanced, among other reasons, because online purchases of consumer goods have expanded markedly in the past decade.",
        "The Committee assessed that these factors do not reflect weakness in demand.",
        "In addition, they observed that should the shekel begin to appreciate again, it will slow the increase in inflation.",
        "In their discussion on the global economy, the Committee members said that high levels of activity continue in most economies, despite some weakness seen in recent activity indices.",
        "Likewise, they referred to the US Federal Reserve being expected to continue the path of increasing the federal funds rate, while the decline in the inflation rate in Europe and in Japan is expected to push off the decision to withdraw from their accommodative monetary policy.",
        "The Committee members noted that the exchange rate continues to stay relatively stable since the beginning of the year (though it appreciated slightly since the last interest rate decision) and most were of the opinion that the shekel is still overappreciated.",

        "With regard to the housing market, the Committee noted that housing market data continue to show that the increase in home prices has halted, against the background of the increase in supply in recent years, and in the past 6 months (for which data were published) prices declined.",
        "The Committee members said that investment in residential construction declined in response to moderation of demand.",

        "These members claimed that the inflation environment remains below the lower bound of the target range and that the interest rate should be kept at its low level to support its entrenchment within the target range.",
        "They added that if the interest rate rises before inflation is entrenched within the target range, it is liable to delay the entrenchment of the inflation environment and ultimately to slow the path of interest rate increase.",

        "The discussion focused on several main issues: (1) real economic activity; (2) inflation, (3) the global environment and the exchange rate; and (4) the housing market.",
        "In their discussion on economic activity, the Committee members noted that according to initial Central Bureau of Statistics estimates of National Accounts data for 2017, the growth rate averaged 3 percent, similar to the economy’s potential growth rate.",
        "The composition of growth during the period seems more balanced.",
        "It was not based solely on growth in private consumption (3 percent), but also on marked growth in exports (3.9 percent), thanks to growth in the export of services.",
        "The Committee members said that recent data hint at a decline in the growth of exports, and discussed the Research Department’s forecast, which projects that the economy will continue to grow by about 3.5 percent in each of the next two years.",
        "The Committee members also noted that labor market data indicate a “tight labor market”, which is reflected in a record high employment rate, a record low unemployment rate, a high level of job vacancies relative to the number of unemployed people, a decline in the rate of people who are employed in part time positions involuntarily, and a rapid increase in wages in the past two years.",
        "The Committee discussed inflation and noted that for most of 2017, it ranged within positive bounds.",
        "The situation in the labor market, and particularly the rapid rate of wage increases, provide a basis for the assessment that inflation will continue to increase.",
        "Inflation in Israel and abroad was affected, inter alia, by the increase in oil prices.",
        "The Committee members stated that there are a few factors reducing the rate of inflation at this time, including the appreciation of the shekel, actions taken by the government to reduce the cost of living, enhancement of competition, and the low level of global inflation.",
        "Their assessment was that these factors do not reflect a weakness of demand.",
        "The Committee members noted that the global environment is in a positive trend, reflected in the recovery of global growth and world trade and in price increases in the financial markets.",
        "This trend is expected to increase demand for Israeli exports.",
        "They pointed out that despite the positive trend, the major central banks are still not meeting the inflation targets.",
        "The ECB maintained its negative interest rate policy, and even though it reduced the extent of asset purchases, this policy is expected to continue until at least December.",
        "The US Federal Reserve increased its interest rate as expected.",
        "The Committee members expressed concern over the marked trend of appreciation of the shekel in the past few weeks, mainly due to the weakness of the dollar worldwide.",
        "A continuation of this trend will delay the return of inflation to the target range.",
        "The Committee members agreed that the exchange rate is over-appreciated.",
        "The Committee noted that housing market data continue to point to moderation of demand, particularly a decline in the number of transactions and a slowdown in the rate of housing price increases.",
        "Building starts declined in recent months, but the Committee members mentioned that this figure is generally revised upward over time, that there is a marked increase in building permits, and that this will likely be reflected in future building starts.",
        "In addition, the Committee members discussed the connection between building starts and building completions.",
        "They stated that at least until May of 2017, building starts reached a historically very high level, and we can therefore expect a high level of building completions in the coming two years and an increase in supply, which may lead to a decline in the prices of housing services.",
        "All the Committee members agreed to keep the interest rate at its current level in view of the low inflation environment, monetary policy in major economies, and developments in the exchange rate.",
        "In its notice, the Committee emphasized that the monetary accommodation will remain in place as long as necessary in order to entrench the inflation environment within the target range.",
        "One of the Committee members noted that the low inflation rate is impacted, inter alia, by the fact that price levels in Israel are high to begin with relative to the global levels, and the fact that the government is working to reduce the cost of living, and that it does not indicate a problem with demand.",
        "Therefore, it would not be correct for the Committee to condition a change in monetary policy only on developments in inflation, and it would be proper to decide on policy while noting additional considerations, including the manner in which the continued low interest rate affects asset prices and savings.",
        "Another Committee member noted that in view of the continued deviation of inflation from the target, it is appropriate that the Committee examine the possibility of monetary accommodation through the use of additional policy tools.",
        "He added that the countries with prevailing low inflation took drastic measures to extract themselves from it.",

        "The Committee members said that the composition of growth in the past year seems more balanced, but there is variance in exports, with services exports growing more rapidly than goods exports.",
        "The Committee referred as well to labor market data that continue to indicate a tight labor market, reflected in record high employment and participation rates, a low in unemployment, and a rapid increase in wages in the past three years, though the rate of increase moderated in recent months.",
        "The Committee noted that the inflation environment remains markedly low, adding that it is on a trend of some growth in recent months: core inflation indices are slightly above actual inflation, and expectations derived from the capital market have been on an upward trend in recent months.",
        "The Committee members said that on a seasonally adjusted basis, the recent CPI readings were relatively high, but they noted that certain factors continue to delay the return of inflation at this time, including the government’s activities to reduce the cost of living and to enhance competition, and online purchases of consumer goods having expanded markedly in the past decade.",
        "They assessed that these factors do not reflect weakness in demand.",
        "In contrast, the prolonged increase in wages due to the tight labor market, which in the past year was also translated into an increase in unit labor cost, is expected to support the return of the inflation rate to within the target range.",
        "The Committee members noted that global economic growth continued to improve, and international entities revised their growth forecasts for major economies upward.",
        "However, the risks to continued growth increased: monthly global sentiment indices have shown a decline in recent months, concerns of a “trade war” increased (even though the steps taken so far have had limited effect), geopolitical tension increased, and US financial conditions tightened.",
        "It was also noted that US legislators are increasing the pressure to impose regulation on Internet companies that use users’ Reserve increased the federal funds rate by 25 basis points in its most recent decision, and is expected to increase the rate twice more in 2018.",

        "The Committee noted that housing market data continue to show that the increase in home prices has halted, against the background of the increase in supply in recent years, and in the past 5 months prices declined.",
        "The Committee members said that investment in residential construction declined in the past three quarters, and the pace of building starts and completions declined in the last months of 2017.",
        "However, the number of building permits increased.",
        "The Committee members were of the opinion that this increase may reflect a renewed increase in building starts, which will support continued decline in prices.",
        "As noted, five Committee members were of the opinion that the interest rate should be kept at its current level.",
        "These members claimed that the inflation environment continues to be markedly low and the interest rate should be kept at its low level to support its return to within the target range.",
        "They added that the interest rate increasing before inflation is entrenched within the target range is liable to delay the entrenchment of the inflation environment and ultimately to slow the path of interest rate increase.",
        "The Committee members also noted that although the low interest rate creates financial risks, these are not only the outcome of the interest rate set by the Bank of Israel, and are not high to the extent that requires an increase of the interest rate: mortgage volume has been moderating in the past two years, the increase in home prices was halted and there was even a decline in home prices in the past five months, the growth in consumer credit has moderated, and at the same time the increase in labor income continues and the level of savings, even after declining, is high in international comparison.",
        "One of the Committee members was of the opinion that the interest rate should be increased to 0.25 percent, claiming that the low inflation rate does not indicate a problem with demand.",
        "This Committee member claimed that the weight assigned to the over-appreciated exchange rate should be reduced, as it is expected that exports will become less sensitive to the exchange rate as the economy switches from goods exports to services exports, and because world trade is expanding.",

        "In their discussion on economic activity, the Committee said that initial indicators of third quarter activity point to continued expansion, and the members assessed that the slowing in the second quarter derived from transitory factors, particularly the volatility in vehicle imports.",
        "They noted that the Composite State of the Economy Index and the Purchasing Managers Index point to continued expansion, and that the findings of the Business Tendency Survey and preliminary findings from the Companies Survey strengthen the assessment that the economy continues to grow at a pace close to its potential rate.",
        "An analysis of Current Account data indicates that the decline in the surplus was mainly a result of growth in goods imports, which supports the assessment that there is excess demand in the economy, which is being directed toward imports.",

        "The Committee referred as well to the labor market and noted that the data show that it remains tight—the employment and participation rates are high, the unemployment rate is low, and wages continue to rise at a solid pace.",
        "The Committee assessed that since the previous interest rate decision, there was no major change in the inflation environment.",

        "They noted that although the CPI readings for July and August were lower than expected, they assessed that it was more plausible to assume that it was a transitory deviation from the inflation trend than a downturn in the trend.",
        "It was noted that in the coming months the annual inflation rate may decline temporarily to below the lower bound of the target, but that 1-year expectations from the various sources remain in the same environment in which they were at the previous interest rate decision, and forward expectations for medium and long terms remain entrenched within the target range.",
        "The Committee assessed that the forces supporting an increase in inflation remain in place.",
        "These include, among other things, the rising wages in the economy, the vigorous private consumption, inflation abroad and the expansionary fiscal policy.",
        "It was noted that in the past year inflation rose to near the lower bound of the target, but it was a temporary rise, after which inflation again declined.",
        "However, the Committee members assessed that the forces mentioned above will support the continued rise, and therefore the probability of a prolonged decline of inflation is relatively low.",
        "One member noted that these forces have already been acting for a long time while inflation in Israel continues to rise at a moderate pace.",
        "The Committee members agreed that the main risk to the continued entrenchment derives from the possibility of renewed appreciation of the shekel.",
        "The Committee agreed that the global economy continues to present a positive trend, led by the US economy.",
        "With that, the members assessed that the risks have grown: the growth rate of world trade is moderating against the background of the developing trade war and apparently also against the background of a change in the structure of China’s economy.",
        "In addition, there is volatility in emerging economies’ financial markets against the background of the rise in US yields and the trade war.",
        "The Committee noted that the OECD slightly lowered its global growth forecast, as a result of the lowered forecast for the eurozone and other markets.",
        "It also noted that oil prices resumed rising, against the background of supply side effects.",
        "The Committee members assessed that monetary policy in Europe and Japan is expected to remain accommodative.",
        "In contrast, in the US the monetary contraction is expected to continue against the background of activity data and the convergence of inflation to its target.",
        "In terms of the shekel, the Committee members said that the nominal effective exchange rate has remained relatively stable for more than a year, but at an appreciated level from a historical perspective.",
        "The Committee members assessed that the forces for appreciation weakened against the background of the widening interest rate spreads between Israel and the world and the contraction of the Current Account surplus.",
        "The Committee members discussed housing market developments, and data received regarding home prices.",
        "They noted, among other things, the low level of investment in residential construction (despite the increase in building starts in the second quarter).",
        "In addition, the rise in new mortgage volume was discussed, which has continued despite the interest rate on mortgages remaining stable in recent months.",
        "As noted, four of six Committee members were of the opinion that the interest rate should be kept at its current level.",
        "They explained that although annual inflation in the past three months has been within the target range, it is still too early to determine that the inflation environment is sufficiently entrenched, and therefore the monetary interest rate should be kept unchanged.",
        "They noted the uncertainty regarding the development of inflation in the coming months, primarily against the background of the assessment that during that period the annual inflation rate is expected to decline temporarily to below the lower bound of the target, which could impact on expectations.",
        "They assessed that over the coming months conditions for raising the interest rate may come into place, but that the path of increasing the interest rate will be moderate, so as not to disrupt the entrenchment of the inflation rate within the target.",
        "Two Committee members were of the view that the interest rate should be raised to 0.25 percent.",
        "They said that the Committee is in agreement that the low inflation rate in Israel does not reflect weakness in demand.",
        "In addition, they noted that after inflation’s upward trend for some time, the low level of the monetary interest rate is not appropriate for the economy’s parameters.",
        "They noted that leaving the interest rate at a low level for a considerable time has negative effects over the long term, and that in the decision on the level of the interest rate, the Committee should give greater weight to those effects.",
        "The two members claimed that raising the monetary interest rate by 0.15 percentage points will keep the monetary policy accommodative and in their assessment is consistent with the Committee’s forward guidance.",
        "In general, the Committee members differed in their assessments regarding the date when it will be possible to begin raising the interest rate, but agreed that when the interest rate begins to rise, the increases will be gradual and cautious.",
        "The Committee emphasized that the beginning of the increase is contingent on the economic indicators that will become available and to the extent that they will support the assessment that the inflation environment has become entrenched within the target range.",
        "As such, the Committee assesses that in any one of the coming interest rate decisions it will be possible to raise the interest rate in accordance with the data and the manner in which the Committee members analyze them.",

        "After the discussion, it was decided to keep the interest rate unchanged at 0.1 percent.",
        "Five Committee members supported the proposal to keep the interest rate unchanged, and one Committee member supported increasing the interest rate to 0.25 percent.",
        "The discussion focused on several main issues: (1) real economic activity; (2) inflation, (3) the global environment and the exchange rate, (4) the housing market, and (5) the forward guidance policy.",
        "In their discussion on economic activity, the Committee members discussed National Accounts data for the fourth quarter of 2017.",
        "They noted that the economy is growing at a pace similar to its potential growth rate, and that the composition of growth in the past year seems more balanced: It was not based solely on private consumption growth, but also on an increase in exports, against the background of solid growth in world trade.",
        "The Committee referred as well to labor market data that indicate a tight labor market, reflected in a record high employment rate, a record low unemployment rate, a high ratio of job vacancies to the number of unemployed people, a decline in the share of people who are employed in part time positions involuntarily, and a rapid increase in wages in the past three years.",
        "It was noted that the increase in wage per employee post moderated in recent months, but data on the growth in health tax receipts (updated through January 2018) indicate continued increase at a high rate.",
        "The Committee noted that the inflation environment is lower than the target.",
        "They added that there was some increase in inflation expectations from the various sources, against the background of the depreciation that occurred since the last interest rate decision.",
        "They said that the inflation rate is expected to decline in the coming period, in accordance with the seasonal path and due to government-initiated price reductions; however, to the extent that the shekel deprecation will persist, it—and with it, the increase in wages—is expected to support a rise in inflation.",
        "The Committee members said that some factors continue to reduce the inflation rate at this time, including measures the government is taking to reduce the cost of living, the enhanced competition reflected in, among other things, a marked increase in online purchases of consumer products over the past decade, and the relatively low level of global inflation.",
        "They assessed that these factors do not reflect weakness in demand.",
        "The Committee members noted that the global environment is in a positive trend, reflected in upward revisions of international institutions’ growth forecasts for major economies and for world trade.",
        "The improvement in the global economy is expected to increase demand for Israeli exports.",
        "They noted that the US Federal Reserve is expected to increase the federal funds rate at its next meeting, and twice more in 2018.",
        "Despite other central banks continuing to adopt accommodative monetary policy, a less accommodative future path of monetary policy is beginning to be priced in to financial markets.",
        "The ECB maintained its negative interest rate policy and signaled that it is expected to continue.",
        "The Committee members discussed the deprecation in the shekel against the background of Bank of Israel intervention in the foreign exchange market, and occurrences in financial markets.",
        "The majority of Committee members claimed that the shekel is over-appreciated.",
        "The Committee noted that housing market data continue to point to moderation of demand, which is reflected in the continued decline in the number of transactions and a decrease in home prices in the last three months for which data was published.",
        "The Committee members noted that investment in residential construction declined in the past three quarters, and it is possible that this decline indicates a moderation in supply of homes as well.",
        "The Committee members reiterated that the monetary accommodation will be maintained as long as necessary in order to entrench the inflation environment within the target range.",
        "One of the Committee members noted that there will be room for further accommodation in the future if the inflation environment remains below target, and particularly if there is continued moderation in the increase in wages, which is the main factor that would support an increase in inflation.",
        "Another member said that as the low inflation rate does not indicate a problem in demand, it would not be right for the Committee to condition a change in monetary policy only on developments in inflation, and it would be correct to decide on policy taking into account other considerations, including the manner in which the continued low interest rate impacts on asset prices and on savings.",
        "As noted, five Committee members reasoned that the interest rate should be kept unchanged.",
        "In their reasoning for the decision, the Committee members noted that the inflation environment remains low and that there is a need to keep the interest rate at its low level in order to support its return to within the target range.",
        "They added that increasing the interest rate before the entrenchment of inflation within the target range is liable to ultimately delay the return of the interest rate to higher levels, due to its possible impact on the exchange rate and on inflation expectations.",
        "The Committee members also noted that although the low interest rate creates financial risks, they are not only the result of the interest rate set by the Bank of Israel, and they are not at such a high level that requires an increase in the interest rate: mortgage volume stabilized, the increase in consumer credit moderated, and in parallel the increase in labor income continues, and the level of savings, even after declining, remains high by international comparison.",
        "One of the Committee members was of the opinion that the interest rate should be raised to 0.25 percent.",
        "He felt that the low inflation rate is impacted by, among other things, the level of prices in Israel being higher to begin with compared with other countries and the government working to reduce the cost of living, and it does not indicate a problem with demand.",
        "This Committee member was of the opinion that less emphasis should be placed on the over-appreciated level of the exchange rate in view of the economy’s switch from goods exports to services exports and the growth in world trade, which are expected to reduce the sensitivity of exports to the level of the exchange rate.",
        "It is therefore proper to decide on the policy while taking into account other considerations, including the manner in which the continued low interest rate impacts on asset prices and on saving.",

        "In their discussion on economic activity, the Committee members deliberated on National Accounts data.",
        "It was noted that although there was a decline in growth in the second quarter, it was apparently fluctuation around the potential growth rate.",
        "It was noted in this context that growth in the first half of the year was 4 percent.",
        "Several indicators of economic activity, such as the Composite State of the Economy Index and the Business Tendency Survey, point to the economy continuing to grow at a solid pace.",
        "Current private consumption in this quarter continued to grow at a high rate, and the decline in growth derived mainly from fluctuations in vehicle imports.",
        "With that, the continued decline in investment in residential construction, and the decline in goods and services exports in the second quarter were noted.",
        "The Committee referred to labor market data indicating that it remains tight—employment and participation rates around record highs, an increase seen in the number of job vacancies, and wages continuing to increase, particularly in the business sector.",
        "The Committee noted that the inflation environment continues to increase, supported by the accommodative monetary policy, and is it apparently beginning to become entrenched within the target range.",
        "In the past two months, the inflation rate has been in the target range and most of its components have been positive.",
        "It was noted that for almost a year, there has been an upward trend in the CPI excluding energy, fruit and vegetables, and price reductions initiated by the government, and that for the first time in quite some time the rate of inflation in prices of tradable goods has been positive, affected by the increase in energy prices and by the depreciation of the shekel.",
        "One-year inflation expectations are in the lower part of the target, mediumterm expectations are becoming entrenched in the target, and longer term expectations are anchored within the target.",
        "The Committee members discussed factors that support the entrenchment of inflation within the target range, including the increase in wages, a process that until now has been accompanied by a moderate acceleration of inflation; increased demand; and the relative stability of the shekel against major currencies.",
        "The main risk to the continued entrenchment is the possibility of renewed appreciation of the shekel.",
        "The Committee members noted that the global economy is on a positive trend, despite the moderation in the growth rate of world trade, the tightening of financial conditions in developing economies, and the slight slowing of growth in Europe and Japan.",
        "These trends were reflected in the forecast published by the IMF: It kept its forecast for the global growth rate unchanged and slightly reduced the forecast for the growth rate in Europe and Japan.",
        "The US economy continues to grow, inflation continues to firm up at the target, and the Federal Reserve is expected to increase the federal funds rate another two times in 2018.",
        "Monetary policy in Europe and Japan is expected to remain accommodative.",
        "The Committee members said that the moderation in world trade is apparently impacted by the change in the structure of China’s economy and by concern of the trade war that has been developing recently.",
        "They noted that it is not an immediate threat to the Israeli economy but rather a longer term one.",
        "The Committee members noted that the shekel continues to remain relatively stable against major currencies, despite an appreciation of approximately 2 percent in effective exchange rate terms.",
        "The shekel appreciation derives mainly from the weakening of the Turkish lira and of emerging market currencies.",
        "The Committee assessed that the contraction of the current account surplus will be a force that will moderate the appreciation pressures, but noted that from a historical perspective the shekel remains appreciated, and that renewed appreciation against major currencies, should it occur, is liable to delay the entrenchment of inflation within the target range.",
        "The Committee noted that housing market data indicate that the past year’s trend of decline in prices has halted.",
        "Investment in residential construction declined in the past five quarters and a decline is apparent in building starts and completions.",
        "In contrast, there has been an increase in new mortgage volume and in borrowers’ LTV ratios while the mortgage interest rate has remained stable.",
        "As noted, five Committee members were of the opinion that the interest rate should be kept at its current level.",
        "Of the five, four Committee members claimed that although it appears that the inflation environment is moving toward entrenchment within the price stability target range, and that there is room to begin preparing the markets for the possibility of a measured increase in the interest rate, nonetheless in order to support the entrenchment the interest rate should be kept at its current level for now.",
        "They expressed varying opinions regarding the various parameters of inflation and of inflation expectations for different horizons that will be required in order to change the policy, and emphasized the uncertainty regarding the developments of inflation in the coming months.",
        "They agreed that if the interest rate begins to rise before the inflation rate is entrenched within the target range, it is liable to delay the entrenchment of the inflation environment and ultimately to slow the path of increasing the interest rate.",
        "Another Committee member claimed that the current interest rate is not in line with the state of the economy, and that it would be proper to increase the interest rate to 0.25 percent; however, as the possibility for such a step has not yet been internalized by the financial markets, he supports keeping the interest rate unchanged in the current decision.",
        "Another Committee member claimed that the interest rate should be raised to 0.25 percent.",

        "The discussion focused on several main issues: (1) real economic activity, (2) the inflation environment, (3) the global environment and the exchange rate, and (4) financial stability. '",
        "Main points of discussion In their discussion on economic activity, the Committee members said that indicators of activity show that it moderated but that the economy continues to grow at a pace close to its potential rate.",
        "The members assessed that the slowdown in the second and third quarters apparently derived partly from the growth rate declining from the high rate of recent years, to its potential environment, and partly from transitory factors— the volatility in vehicle imports.",
        "One Committee member noted that the initial estimate of third quarter National Accounts data should not be given considerable weight as it is expected to be revised and because the other indicators remained positive.",
        "Another member added that the accuracy of seasonal adjustment of third quarter data may have been impacted by the Jewish holiday season occurring essentially entirely in September this year.",
        "All Committee members agreed that initial indicators of fourth quarter data—including the Composite State of the Economy Index, the Purchasing Managers Index, and the Business Tendency Survey—support the assessment that the economy continues to grow at close to its potential rate.",
        "As for the composition of GDP, the Committee members examined the trends that arise from National Accounts data—the continued contraction in investment, the moderate increase in private consumption, and the weakness in goods exports—and discussed the question of whether they indicate supply constraints that derive from the proximity to full employment; they assessed that at the current time it is difficult to determine that such is the case.",
        "The Committee also referred to the labor market and noted that its data indicate that it remains tight—high employment and participation rates, a low unemployment rate, an increase in the job vacancy rate, and wages that continue to increase at a solid pace, led by the business sector, across a wide range of industries and all wage levels.",
        "The Committee noted that the data that became available since the previous interest rate decision support the assessment that inflation is stabilizing in the bottom part of the target range.",
        "It was noted that the annual inflation rate has been within the target range for the past five months, semiannual inflation (seasonally adjusted, in annual terms) has been above 1 percent for close to a year already, and the adjusted indices are around the lower bound of the target.",
        "The members noted that the CPI readings for July and August were lower than expected, and it was unclear at the time if these were a transitory deviation from the inflation trend, or a decline in the trend; however, currently the data indicate that there is not a downturn in the inflation trend and that the deviation was transitory: when examining the tradable and nontradable price indices, inflation is found to be more homogeneous.",
        "They also noted that in accordance with the forecasts for the coming months, annual inflation is expected to remain within the target range.",
        "However, in contrast, they noted that the 1-year expectations derived from the capital market moderated since the last interest rate decision, though they remain around the lower bound of the target range.",
        "As for forward expectations for medium and long terms, the members said that they remain entrenched within the target range.",
        "The Committee assessed that the forces supporting an increase in the inflation rate remain in place—including, among other things, the wage increases in the economy, inflation abroad, the expansionary fiscal policy, and the fact that monetary policy worldwide has become more hawkish.",
        "Moreover, in recent years several factors acted to lead to a decline in inflation, including, among other things, the measures adopted by the government to reduce the cost of living, the enhancement of competition in the economy, and the appreciation of the shekel, and recently, the effect of some of those factors weakened.",
        "The sharp decline in oil prices could impact on expectations, but its effect on inflation should be properly analyzed as a one-off factor.",
        "The members were of the opinion that there is a relatively low probability of a prolonged decline of inflation to below the lower bound of the target.",
        "The Committee discussed developments in the global economy, and assessed that the risks have grown and momentum has slowed.",
        "The members noted that the US economy continues to grow at a solid pace but they pointed to several risks that are liable to weigh on the continuation of the growth trend—in particular, (1) the worsening of the trade war, and (2) the declines in US equities markets and the rise in spreads (risk off), primarily in the high tech sector.",
        "One of the members noted that it appears that the decline in the equities market is only a correction, as it does not come in tandem with a decline in corporate profits.",
        "In terms of the European economy, the Committee assessed that the decline in growth occurred against the background of changes in auto industry regulation, progress on Brexit, and the recent increase in the tension between Italy and European authorities as the Italian government’s proposed budget includes an increase in the deficit.",
        "In contrast, the Committee assessed that the weak euro strengthens the European market compared with the rest of the world.",
        "With regard to China, the Committee noted that there is some slowdown in the growth rate but it remains high.",
        "The Committee said that monetary policy worldwide remains accommodative from a historical perspective, but the trend of monetary contraction continues, and additional central banks raised their monetary interest rate since the previous interest rate decision.",
        "The Committee members assessed that the US is expected to continue the normalization process for the federal funds rate, and that the worldwide quantitative easing is expected to continue contracting as the US Federal Reserve reduces its balance sheet and the ECB plans to end its asset purchase program in 2019.",
        "In terms of the exchange rate, the Committee members said that since the last interest rate decision, the shekel weakened by 3.6 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate, and by a similar rate (3.2 percent) against the dollar.",
        "The shekel remained appreciated from a historical perspective, though the appreciation in terms of the real effective exchange rate is more moderate than in terms of the nominal rate.",
        "The Committee members assessed that the main risk to the continued entrenchment in the target range is appreciation of the shekel.",
        "The Committee members discussed housing market developments and home price data.",
        "They noted that the most recent data on the number of transactions point to stabilization, after the figures rose in the beginning of the year.",
        "With regard to home prices, the members said that in recent months stability is apparent.",
        "The stabilization in new mortgage volume was also discussed, against the background of the rise in the interest rate on mortgages.",
        "With regard to financial developments in Israel, the Committee noted that nonfinancial business credit continues to expand and that there is a slight rise in corporate bond spreads.",
        "As noted, the decision reached at the discussion was to increase the interest rate by since March 2015.",
        "Four of the five Committee members supported the decision to raise the interest rate.",
        "They assessed that the economic considerations are the decisive factors in reaching the interest rate decision, and not the fact that the Bank is in a period of transition between governors.",
        "They explained that the conditions had ripened for the beginning of the process of withdrawing from the very accommodative policy that had been adopted in recent years.",
        "At the previous interest rate decision, there was uncertainty regarding the development of the upcoming consumer price indices, and the assessment that was formulated was that annual inflation may decline temporarily to below the lower bound of the target range.",
        "However since then data became available that support the assessment that inflation is stabilizing in the lower part of the target range, and in their evaluation, the probability of a prolonged decrease to below the lower bound is relatively low.",
        "Some of the members were of the opinion that the low interest rate—the nominal interest rate of 0.1 percent and the real interest rate of -1 percent—is not appropriate for the economy’s parameters, particularly an economy that is growing at around its potential rate and is accompanied by an accelerated pace of wage increases, and leaving it low for a prolonged time is liable to create negative impacts in the long term.",
        "One Committee member supported leaving the interest rate unchanged, at 0.1 percent.",
        "In his assessment, it is a borderline situation and either decision—increasing the interest rate to 0.25 percent and leaving it unchanged—can be justified.",
        "However, he claimed that it is appropriate that the withdrawal from the accommodative policy be initiated by the Committee headed by the new Governor.",
        "The Committee emphasized that the continued withdrawal from the accommodative policy is contingent on economic indicators, and that the decisions in the future will continue to be made in accordance with developments in inflation, the real economy, financial markets and the global economy, with the goal of attaining the monetary policy targets.",
        "The Committee members assessed that the continuation of the normalization process will be carried out gradually and cautiously.",

        "In their discussion on economic activity, the Committee members analyzed several estimates indicating that the economy is growing at a solid pace, among others the second estimate of first quarter National Accounts data, which showed a growth rate of 4.5 percent in annual terms.",
        "In contrast, activity indicators for the second quarter point to some slowing in the growth rate.",
        "For example, preliminary data from the Companies Survey indicate that the second quarter growth rate is around the potential rate.",
        "The Committee members assessed that the slowing that is becoming apparent in the second quarter is expected to have derived from a decline in vehicle imports, a correction to an anomalous increase in the first quarter.",
        "Thus, the Committee members added that looking at the first half overall, it appears that growth is in line with the potential growth rate.",
        "Further on, they referred to the continued decline in residential construction, the moderation in the rate of growth of services exports and the decline in goods exports.",
        "The Committee referred to the labor market data indicating that it remains tight—record high employment and participation rates, a low in unemployment, and wages continuing to increase at a rapid pace, led by wages in the business sector.",
        "The Committee noted that the inflation environment continues to increase gradually, supported by the accommodative monetary policy, and is approaching the target range.",
        "They noted that with the publication of the CPI reading for June, the inflation rate as measured over the preceding 12 months is expected to enter the target range defined as price stability, and that 1-year inflation expectations from the various sources, particularly those derived from the capital market, increased sharply since the last interest rate decision.",
        "The Committee members said that although based on indices that exclude transitory effects, the inflation rate increased slightly in the past period, it is still in the environment in which it has ranged for a long time, indicating that structural inflation rose at a moderate pace.",
        "The Committee members discussed factors that support the entrenchment of inflation within the target range.",
        "They noted that in recent years, companies absorbed the wage increase without raising prices as it was offset by the decline in prices of other manufacturing inputs, such as oil.",
        "However, currently, with oil prices having increased, the rise in wages is expected to be reflected in an increase in the inflation rate.",
        "In addition, the exchange rate, which in recent years was a main factor in the low inflation rate, stabilized, which supports an increase in inflation.",
        "The Committee members noted that various factors are likely to lead to a delay in the return of the inflation rate to the target, including (1) a decline in oil prices, (2) enhanced competition, and (3) renewed shekel appreciation.",
        "In the Committee’s view, these factors do not reflect weakness in demand.",
        "The Committee members discussed the meaning of the entrenchment of the inflation environment within the target range, with regard to the forward guidance that the Committee provides to the public.",
        "It was noted that the Committee does not specifically mean that the inflation rate will be in the middle of the target range when it refers to the issue of entrenchment.",
        "However, as inflation tends to be volatile, a situation in which the inflation environment is expected to be very close to the lower bound of the target range does not constitute entrenchment of inflation within the target range, but at the same time the trend of inflation needs to be taken into account.",
        "Likewise, most Committee members noted that to establish that the inflation environment is entrenched within the target, they will want to be sure, to the extent possible, that the return of inflation to within the target range will not only last for a few months.",
        "In their discussion on the global economy, the Committee members said that the data continue to be positive, although it appears that the growth is losing momentum, particularly in Europe and Japan.",
        "The US economy is close to full employment, inflation continues to converge to its target, and the Federal Reserve is expected to continue raising the interest rate.",
        "In Europe, activity shows signs of moderating, the ECB is not expected to raise the interest rate until the fall of 2019, and it is only expected to end its bond purchases at the end of 2018.",
        "Regarding world trade, the Committee members said that its growth rate has slowed in recent months.",
        "The Committee members noted that the risk of a trade war has heightened in recent weeks, and they expressed concern that it is likely to have a negative effect on world trade and to adversely impact demand for Israeli exports.",
        "They emphasized that it is not an immediate threat, but rather a longer term one.",
        "The Committee members noted that although the shekel has weakened, from a historical perspective it remains appreciated.",
        "They added that the strengthening of the dollar in the world, against the background of the Fed’s interest rate increase, supported the recent weakening of the shekel.",
        "With regard to the housing market, the Committee noted that the data indicate a decline in prices, which has moderated in the past two months, against the background of the increase in supply in recent years.",
        "The Committee members said that investment in residential construction declined apparently in response to moderation of demand.",
        "They noted that there is a difficulty in understanding the picture related to supply of new homes, as there aren’t updated data on the stock of new homes for sale, which weighs on the analysis of the reasons for the halt in building starts.",
        "In parallel, some acceleration is apparent in the rate of increase of rents, as the decline in relative supply of housing services creates pressure on those prices.",
        "As noted, five Committee members were of the opinion that the interest rate should be kept at its current level.",
        "These members claimed that the inflation environment is approaching the target but that the interest rate should be kept at its low level to support its entrenchment within the target range.",
        "They added that if the interest rate rises before inflation is entrenched within the target range, it is liable to delay the entrenchment of the inflation environment and ultimately to slow the path of interest rate increase.",
        "One of the Committee members was of the opinion that the interest rate should be increased to 0.25 percent, in view of the trend of increase in the inflation rate, and the CPI over the past 12 months still being impacted by the anomalous decline in the CPI for June 2017.",
        "This is in particular against the background of the GDP growth rates, the increase in wages at a solid pace, prices levels in Israel being higher than those in countries with a similar GDP per capita, and the financial risks inherent in a low interest rate for an extended period of time.",

        "The depreciation of the shekel and the increase in commodity prices since then, and the National Accounts figures published recently showing rapid growth in the fourth quarter of 2010, are expected to lead to an upward revision of the inflation forecast to around the upper limit of the target inflation range, and to a somewhat faster forecast rate of increases in the Bank of Israel interest rate than the previous forecast.",
        "The main reason for the assessment that inflation will be above the midpoint of the target range are: the price of housing (rentals), which is expected to continue rising relatively rapidly, an increase in aggregate demand, and increases in energy and commodity prices.",
        "Factors acting in the opposite direction are the low level of inflation in the advanced economies, and the appreciation of the shekel, which act to slow the rate of price increases.",

        "In the current discussions on the interest rate for March, three members of management participated in the discussion, and all three recommended that the Governor increase the interest rate by 0.25 of a percentage point, to 2.5 percent.",
        "As stated in previous announcements of interest rate decisions, the Bank of Israel is implementing a policy consistent with the process of gradually restoring a more normal interest rate environment—a process aimed at stabilizing inflation within the target range, and supporting further growth of economic activity while maintaining financial stability.",
        "The pace of interest rate increases is not fixed, but depends on the inflation environment, growth in Israel and globally, the monetary policies of the major central banks, developments in asset prices, and the exchange rates of the shekel.",
        "The 25-basis-point increase in the interest rate for March is consistent with that process.",
        "At the new rate of interest, monetary policy continues to be expansionary.",
        "Several issues were discussed, including the path of inflation, an assessment of the environment of real economic activity, the housing market, and the possible effect on the exchange rate of an increase in the differential between the interest rate in Israel and rates abroad.",
        "In the discussion it was noted that there were indications of a rise in the inflation environment—inflation in the previous twelve months was 3.6 percent, above the upper limit of the inflation target range, and the annual rate of price increases in the last six months (seasonally adjusted) was even higher.",
        "Among the factors contributing to inflation were housing prices (during the last year) and food and energy prices (in the last half year), factors which are expected to continue to exert inflationary pressure in the coming year.",
        "In this context reference was made to the IMF forecast of an increase of about 11 percent in commodity prices, excluding energy, in 2011.",
        "Together with the rise in actual inflation, market expectations of inflation also increased: inflation expectations derived from the capital market (break-even inflation) increased again over the last month, to an average of 3.5 percent.",
        "In discussing the level of real economic activity, the participants spoke of the data published since the last interest rate decision, which indicated a steep increase in activity, led by domestic demand.",
        "The rate of growth in the last quarter of 2010, 7.8 percent, was exceptionally high, and the point was emphasized that even though this was a preliminary quarterly figure that might be amended later, the buoyant level of growth and the fact that rapid growth was recorded also over a longer period, i.e., throughout the second half of 2010, indicate that the economy is in fact in an environment of significant growth.",
        "It was also stated that even if some of the components of growth turn out to be non-recurring, there are indications that the growth is firmly based and not a temporary feature.",
        "These indications include the rapid increase in current consumption and the steep rise in investment that has already continued for a year.",
        "The very modest increase in exports (excluding diamonds) was also noted.",
        "It was noted that despite the rapid expansion of activity no significant increases in wages are evident yet.",
        "That said, the recent frequent labor disputes may be an indication of increased wage pressure in the next few months.",
        "Due to the higher inflation environment and the improvement in real economic activity, the participants agreed that the economic conditions point to the need to raise the interest rate this month.",
        "The participants noted that an increase in the interest rate would also be likely to help slow the rapid increase in house prices to some extent.",
        "There was also discussion of the fact that the markets expect the interest rates of leading central banks to remain low in the near future, so that an increase in the interest rate in Israel would intensify the pressure for the shekel to appreciate.",
        "Nevertheless, in light of the fact that the expected timing in the markets of an increase in the Fed interest rate had been brought forward, and in light of the increased geopolitical uncertainty regarding the Middle East (reflected in wider CDS spreads of the countries in the region, including Israel), the participants were of the view that the appreciation of the shekel resulting from the Bank of Israel increase in the interest rate would probably be partly offset.",
        "Taking all the above points into consideration, the Governor decided to increase the interest rate for March by 25 basis points, to 2.5 percent.",
        "In its announcement of the decision, the Bank of Israel emphasized the following points: - The publication of the January CPI brought the rate of inflation over the previous twelve months to above the upper limit of the target inflation range.",
        "Forecasters’ inflation expectations for one year forward remained stable, close to the upper limit of the target range, and expectations calculated from the capital market continued to rise and reached an average of 3.5 percent last month.",
        "At the same time, the upward trend in inflation expectations for the longer term derived from the capital market persists.",
        "- Economic indicators published this month show that activity expanded at a faster pace, led by domestic demand.",
        "The increased activity was reflected by the high growth rate in the fourth quarter (according to the National Accounts figures), the labor market, and government tax revenues.",
        "Data on global economic activity were also positive, pointing to continued rapid growth in the emerging market economies and to certain acceleration in economic growth in the US economy.",
        "- The steep increase in house prices continued; in the last twelve months they have risen by 17.5 percent.",
        "Although there was a drop in the volume of new mortgages in January, the volume of housing loans is still expanding rapidly.",
        "- The decision to increase the interest rate was taken despite the fact that interest rates of the central banks in the major advanced economies are at low levels, and the markets reflect expectations that they will not rise in the near future.",
        "Nevertheless, the expected timing of an increase in the Fed interest rate has been brought forward.",
        "Furthermore, some central banks in economies that are already showing relatively fast rates of growth continued the process of raising their interest rates again last month.",
        "The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in Israel's economy and the global economy and in the financial markets.",
        "The Bank will use the instruments available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, including keeping a close watch on developments in the assets market, and especially in the housing market.",
        "Finance Division, Research Department Economic data published this month in the US show continued economic recovery, including some improvement in the labor market.",
        "Growth in the fourth quarter of quarters.",
        "At the same time the IMF increased its 2011 growth forecast significantly, from 2.3 percent to 3.0 percent, against the background of the expected fiscal expansion which, in the view of the IMF, will add half a percentage point to the growth rate.",
        "Labor market data published painted a mixed picture: the Non-Farm Payrolls figure was considerably lower than expected, apparently due to the very rough weather that resulted in many employees not arriving at work.",
        "The rate of unemployment, however, suggests a positive trend, with a second consecutive steep reduction, from 9.4 percent to 9 percent.",
        "Despite the improvement, this is still a high rate of unemployment, and the statement by the Federal Open Market Committee stated that the high unemployment rate justified the continuation of the quantitative easing program (QE2), and keeping the interest rate at its near-zero level for some time.",
        "The positive growth figures and the positive atmosphere were reflected in the Michigan Consumer Confidence Index, which rose by 0.9 percent, and by the increase in consumer credit.",
        "Inflation in the US remains low: core inflation was 0 percent in January, and in the last twelve months was 0.7 percent.",
        "Nevertheless, the US economy faces several threats, one of which deriving from the housing market, which continues to show weakness.",
        "House prices, according to the Case-Shiller composite index of 20 metropolitan areas, dropped in November at an annual rate of 1.6 percent.",
        "This index has shown falling house prices in the last five months.",
        "The number of applications for mortgages and the number of house purchase contracts are in a slump.",
        "The increase in yields in the US, despite QE2, that results in increases in long-term interest to those with mortgages, is expected to place a further burden on the market.",
        "The level of the US debt also gives cause for concern.",
        "Moody’s announced that in light of the increased US deficit, it may have to issue a negative rating outlook for the US debt sooner than expected.",
        "Concern over the European debt crisis eased somewhat at the end of January, against the background of the efforts to increase the ability of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) to help the European countries requiring aid, but there was renewed concern regarding the PIIGS countries (Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain), Portugal in particular, at the beginning of February.",
        "The macroeconomic data relating to Europe continue to indicate a mixed trend, with the growth rate in the fourth quarter of 2010 only 0.3 percent, and falls in retail sales, in contrast to the purchase managers indices, which continued to reflect optimism with regard to the future.",
        "Eurozone inflation exceeded the target again this month, with 0.6 percent inflation in January, and 2.4 percent in the last twelve months.",
        "The IMF kept its forecast of EU growth in 2011 at 1.5 percent, and observed that the debt crisis still constitutes the major risk factor to the recovery of the global economy.",
        "With regard to the debt crisis, S&P reduced Ireland’s debt rating from A to A–, and kept its rating outlook negative in light of the uncertainty about the amount of extra capital that Ireland needs.",
        "Yields on Portuguese 10-year government bonds reached a record level of 7.4 percent, and gave rise to concern in the markets that the probability that Portugal would have to ask for aid was increasing, against the background of the fact that Greece and Ireland had requested aid after the yields on their bonds exceeded the 7 percent level.",
        "The emerging markets continued to record rapid growth, providing the background to an IMF report forecasting that commodity prices (excluding energy) would increase by a further 11 percent in 2011.",
        "The monetary contractionary trend thus continued in the emerging market economies.",
        "Thus, in light of rapid growth and high inflation (an annual rate of inflation of 4.9 percent in January), China increased its interest rate this month, the third increase since October.",
        "India also increased its interest rate (for the seventh time in the last year), after the annual inflation rate reached 8.4 percent in December.",
        "In an attempt to deal with the high inflation against the background of capital inflows that exert pressure for appreciation of their currencies, China and Russia both increased their banks’ capital adequacy requirements.",

        "With regard to prices of other assets, attention was drawn to the latest developments in share prices, and the need to monitor those prices more closely.",
        "Another issue discussed was the expected effect of the proposed increase in the interest rate on the exchange rate of the shekel.",
        "Participants expressed the view that the increase in the interest rate would strengthen the existing pressures for appreciation of the shekel, as it would attract capital inflow, and hence strengthen the shekel.",
        "This is in light of the fact that the interest rates of the leading advanced economies remained unchanged.",
        "Acting in the opposite direction, however, were the new Bank of Israel directives strengthening the reporting requirement and increasing the liquidity requirement, which were intended to weaken the above forces somewhat and to act to moderate the effect of the widening of the interest rate differential on the appreciation of the shekel.",

        "Recently published data indicate that the global economy is continuing along the path of recovery from the economic crisis.",
        "- The decision to increase the interest rate was taken despite the fact that interest rates of the central banks in the major advanced economies are at low levels and are not expected to rise in the near future.",
        "Nevertheless, some central banks in economies that are already showing relatively fast rates of growth continued the process of raising their interest rates again last month.",

        "The Bank of Israel will use the instruments available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, including keeping a close watch on developments in the assets market, and especially in the housing market.",
        "Finance Division, Research Department Last month there was a marked rise in private consumption (which is expected to be supported by further tax relief measures and the considerable strengthening of the share market), in credit to the private and business sector, and in the recovery in the motor vehicle industry (the last two which are expected to support the recruitment of additional workers).",
        "In addition, exports grew and the manufacturing and services indices strengthened and are at higher levels than in the previous period.",
        "Employment data also seem to indicate an improvement, with a further decline in the number of layoffs, the creation of about 100,000 new jobs, and a drop in the unemployment rate from 9.8 percent to “only” 9.4 percent.",
        "The minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee (following the decision to hold the interest rate at the near zero level for an extended period in light of the low level of inflation) show that the Committee members consider that the economic situation in the US is improving.",
        "Furthermore, the Fed chairman informed the Senate that private consumption and expenditure by small businesses indicate a sustainable recovery, and he even increased the growth forecast for 2011 to 3–4 percent.",
        "- First, the employment situation seems to be worse than the data suggest, and the labor market continues to be a very serious risk factor to growth in the US.",
        "Thus, for example, the unemployment rate calculated via the comprehensive (U-6) method (a more comprehensive gauge of labor underutilization) is about 16.7 percent, compared with the 9.4 percent rate actually reported.",
        "- Second, the lack of occupational security and falling house prices related to the extent of foreclosures that reached an unprecedented level in 2010 (and which is expected to continue increasing in 2011) continue to indicate the shaky situation in the housing market.",
        "- The increase in the government deficit and the statement by the Secretary of the Treasury that the government’s deficit ceiling, currently $14.3 trillion, is likely to be exceeded as early as the end of March, increase the risks that the quantitative easing program will be cut back later in the year.",
        "Without an improvement in the labor market, this development is likely to be expressed by a fall in private consumption in the future.",
        "In addition, despite the World Bank review that stated that the US is the only large economy in which the rate of growth is not expected to decline in 2011 (the expectation is growth of 2.8 percent), and the increase in investment houses’ 2011 US growth forecasts from 3.07 percent to 3.30 percent, that remains a low rate of growth for a period of exiting from a crisis.",
        "At such a time growth should be significantly faster than the long-term rate, and it is likely to decline in the future due to a fall in the participation rate in the labor market.",

        "However, the need for heavy borrowing in the coming year[4] and the atmosphere of uncertainty prevailing in the European markets are expected to keep the European debt crisis at the center of attention of the global economy in the near future.",
        "In addition, the ECB, which since the outbreak of the crisis has pursued an expansionary monetary policy in light of the low growth rates and high levels of debt, is for the first time caught in a dilemma, as inflation in December was higher than with growth rates and the deficit/GDP ratio, inflation too differs greatly between the PIIGS countries and the core members of the eurozone (Germany recorded the highest growth since reunification in 1990), a fact that is likely to make it more difficult to pursue a uniform monetary policy in such a heterogeneous group of countries.",
        "Although the ECB president decided not to increase the interest rate this month, the market interpreted his statement that the interest rate is appropriate to the level of inflation as a hint that he would be prepared to increase the interest rate in the future to tackle inflation, despite the European debt crisis.",

        "Recently, however, it seems that there has been some slowdown, with a decline in exports, in the trade surplus vis-à-vis the US, and in the Purchasing Managers Index, apparently due to the tightening of monetary policy.",
        "China is still facing the problem of inflation which mainly affects the poor, with steep rises particularly in food prices and more moderate increases in energy prices.",
        "Inflation is thought to have been greatly affected by the weather which ruined crops around the world, so that at least part of its contribution to inflation may be temporary.",
        "In the struggle against rising inflation, the Chinese authorities threatened to impose sanctions on speculators who cause food prices to increase, and the press in China recently reported that it is intended to impose a property tax for the first time.",
        "In addition, the banks’ reserve ratio was increased by 50 basis points this month (to 18.5 percent for the large banks and to an average of 19.5 percent for all banks), following no fewer than six increases in 2010.",
        "All the above steps were aimed at avoiding further increases in the interest rate, that would widen the differential vis-à-vis the emerging market economies, thereby increasing the inflow of capital from there and threatening the stability of the market by creating bubbles in asset prices.",

        "Participants in the discussion dealt with several issues: the inflation environment and inflation expectations, real economic activity, the effect of negative scenarios on the Israeli economy, including developments in the global economy and the geopolitical environment, the exchange rate, and home prices.",
        "With regard to the level of inflation and inflation expectations, the discussion centered primarily on the sharp drop in inflation expectations for the next twelve months calculated from capital markets.",
        "It was noted that the source of the drop is the internalization of a new inflation environment as a result of the global slowdown and expectations of its continuation which will be reflected by lower global demand and will moderate inflation pressures.",
        "Additional factors which were mentioned as lowering inflation expectations were the July CPI reading, which was lower than all analyst forecasts, and the social protests against the high cost of living.",
        "With regard to the environment of real economic activity, it was noted that despite a drop in the rate of export growth in the second quarter, local activity is still strong and the probability that the Israeli economy is currently at the beginning of a recession is low.",
        "It was also noted that after the rapid pace of growth in recent quarters, it is not implausible for there to be somewhat of a slowdown.",
        "Among other things, continued growth in private consumption excluding durable goods, investment in residential construction which is expected to continue to grow given the continued growth in housing starts, and investment in machinery and equipment were mentioned.",

        "A central point of discussion dealt with future scenarios which are liable to negatively impact the Israeli economy, primarily the negative turnaround in the US and Europe, which led to markets not pricing in an interest rate increase in the next year at the central bank of any major developed market.",
        "Among other issues mentioned were the negative sentiment in the world regarding the ability of developed countries to avoid entering a renewed recession, following lower than expected growth figures which were published during the inter-meeting period, downward revisions of future growth estimates, drops in stock markets around the world, as well as the high level of the debt to GDP ratio in a significant number of countries and political limitations which will not allow far reaching changes in fiscal policy.",
        "It was noted that one of the indicators of the likelihood of the world returning to recession will be the reaction of stock markets in the world in the coming period.",
        "It was noted that in coming weeks a lot of data is expected to arrive, relative to calmer periods, on the nature of possible policy steps in developed markets as a response to the worsening of economic activity.",
        "In addition, concern was raised of geopolitical scenarios with possible negative impact on Israel's economy.",
        "Despite all these, it was noted that the relatively strong state of Israel's economy at this time would allow it to absorb these shocks with relatively moderate damage.",
        "The exchange rate was discussed in the context of its impact on exports.",
        "It was noted that the exchange rate level has a lagged effect, and it is possible that the second quarter slowdown in exports was an effect of the appreciation of the shekel in previous quarters.",
        "Likewise, it was noted that export figures, especially services exports–a main source for the slowdown in overall exports–are based on preliminary estimates and there will likely be changes in this area.",
        "It was also noted that the recent depreciation, if it continues, is expected to support exports in the future.",
        "The exchange rate issue also was raised in the context of its impact on inflation expectations, as it was noted that the linkage between depreciation to the level of prices is regarded as low, and is not expected to create inflation pressures.",
        "On house prices, it was stated that in the case of a change in direction of interest rates, the macro-prudential steps which were taken are expected to continue to moderate demand for homes.",
        "With that, it was noted that, should it be necessary, additional steps will be contemplated.",
        "Taking into account the drop in inflation expectations and the moderation in actual inflation, at the same time noting the continued growth in local activity, the geopolitical uncertainty, and against the background of the uncertainty in the strength of the negative turnaround in the global economy and its expected influence on growth in Israel, the four members of the forum recommended leaving the Bank of Israel interest rate unchanged in September.",
        "This step is in line with the drive to gradually return inflation to within the target range, taking into account the other issues noted.",
        "Taking all the above points into consideration, the Governor decided to leave the interest rate for September unchanged at 3.25 percent.",
        "In its announcement of the decision, the Bank of Israel emphasized the following points which supported leaving the interest rate for September 2011 unchanged at - Inflation expectations for the next 12 months, both those calculated from the capital market and those of forecasters, fell significantly in the last month and are now 2 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively.",
        "The updated forecast of the Bank of Israel Research Department is that inflation will enter the target range toward the end of 2011, compared with the previous outlook which forecast the rate to return to the range in the middle of 2012.",
        "The CPI reading for July significantly surprised to the downside, after the four previous readings, seasonally adjusted, were in line with the inflation target range.",
        "With that, inflation over the previous - The growth rate in the second quarter was moderate compared with the previous quarter, mainly as a result of moderation of global demand and its effect on exports, while local demand continued to grow.",
        "Developments since the previous interest rate decision point to a negative turnaround in the US and eurozone, and together with geopolitical risks, may impact economic activity in Israel.",
        "With that, the relatively strong position of Israel's economy currently will allow it to absorb these shocks with a relatively moderate impact.",
        "- The rate of increase in home prices over the previous 12 months continues to be high, though the rate has moderated for the second month; for the 12 months ended in June, the increase was 12.5 percent.",
        "With that, the influence of higher interest rates, steps taken by the Bank of Israel in the mortgage market, and steps by the Ministry of Finance regarding real estate taxation, together with the continued increase in building starts, are expected to continue to provide a moderating effect on home prices during the coming year.",
        "- The negative turnaround in the US and in Europe resulted in markets not pricing in an increase in interest rates by central banks of any of the major developed markets over the coming year.",
        "Likewise, the US Federal Reserve announced this month that it will leave the fed funds rate at its near-zero level until at least the middle of 2013.",
        "The Bank of Israel stated that it will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli economy and the global economy and in financial markets.",
        "The Bank will use the instruments available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, including keeping a close watch on developments in assets markets, including the housing market.",

        "With concerns for a slowdown in the global economy and a sharp drop in inflation expectations around the world, investors today are not pricing in interest rate increases in the coming year at any central bank of major developed markets.",
        "US Commerce Department figures published during the month point to a continuing slowing of US growth, as second quarter growth was only 1 percent (significantly lower than the 1.8 percent forecast).",
        "The figure for the first quarter was revised sharply lower, from 1.9 percent to only 0.4 percent.",
        "In addition, the revision by the US Commerce Department of figures for the prior three years shows that GDP is currently only $13.5 trillion (not $14.3 trillion) and in effect is still lower than the level on the eve of the crisis in 2008.",
        "While macroeconomic data published during the month were mixed, (unemployment, retail sales, and building starts actually surprised to the upside), the negative figures were especially bad and indicated that the US economy is near recession levels.",

        "The FOMC noted the \"temporary\" weakness in food and energy prices (which negatively impacted consumer purchasing power) and the disaster in Japan which impacted the supply chain.",
        "In addition, in light of their forecast for a more moderate growth rate in coming quarters than they previously estimated, and a rise in the level of downside risks, the committee decided to leave the fed funds target rate at 0–0.25 percent at least through the middle of 2013, while the market is pricing in the next rate hike only in early 2014.",
        "Investment houses lowered the average forecast for the US in 2011 from 2.53 percent to 1.74 percent, and for Democrats and Republicans succeeded only at the last minute to reach an agreement on raising the debt ceiling for the US, with a commitment to wide ranging budget cuts, and managed to avoid a technical default.",
        "However, despite the deal, S&P cut the credit rating on US debt to AA+, and left their negative outlook, with a 33 percent chance of lowering the rating further in the next six months to two years, if the US does not carry out the budget cuts to which it committed, or if debt level rises.",
        "S&P said that the US needed an even sharper cut than was decided upon–a cut of 4 trillion, and they lowered their level of confidence in the ability of politicians to deal with the financial challenges.",
        "It can be assumed that upcoming elections are likely to continue the \"paralysis\" of the leadership there in its ability to deal with the crisis.",
        "In light of that, it currently appears that most of the ability to respond to the economic slowdown can only come from the monetary side, through the Federal Reserve.",
        "After Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke did not announce an additional quantitative easing plan at an annual symposium at Jackson Hole, Wyoming (where he previously had announced QE2), there are increasing assessments that he will announce an additional quantitative easing plan with the monetary policy decision announcement in September.",
        "During the month, yields on US bonds fell to historic lows, with the yield to maturity on a 10-year Treasury note falling to an intra-day level of only 1.97 percent.",
        "They have since risen to about 2.25 percent, after Chairman Bernanke said that the economic situation is not severe enough to immediately announce an additional quantitative easing program, and that the Fed has enough tools to move the economy forward.",
        "Like in the US, figures published during the month in Europe were mixed, but the weak numbers were quite bad, as even Germany (which until today has pushed the entire eurozone higher) showed signs of weakness.",
        "The Purchasing Managers Index production, the ZEW Index (in the eurozone and Germany), and primarily weak second quarter growth added to the markets' pessimism.",
        "The eurozone grew 0.2 percent in the second quarter, compared with forecasts of 0.3 percent, with Germany and France lowering the average growth for the eurozone with 0.1 percent and 0 percent second quarter growth, respectively, after strong growth of 1.3 percent and 0.9 percent respectively in the first quarter.",

        "Internal disagreements in Italy regarding the extent of fiscal cuts, which led to concern that the ECB will not agree to purchase its bonds, and a warning from Moody's of a lowering of Spain's debt rating, raised the yield on ten year notes belonging to the two countries to record levels of over 6 percent.",
        "In order to \"placate\" the ECB, and calm the markets, Italy's Prime Minister Berlusconi succeeded in passing though his government an austerity plan which includes sharp fiscal cutbacks of €20 billion next year and an additional €25 billion in 2013, and a legislative decision to work toward a balanced budget by 2013.",
        "These steps were strongly criticized at home because of the negative impact on growth, but they did allow the \"opening shot\" by the ECB in purchasing tens of billions of euros worth of Italian and Spanish government bonds, lowering the yields to the range of 5 percent.",
        "During the month, pressure on the eurozone came from France, the second largest economy in the eurozone, with rumors of a possible rating downgrade, which led to a jump in the CDS spread for France to 185 basis points (higher than Israel's).",
        "In addition to those rumors, the exposure of French banks to Greece, Spain, and Italy led to sharp drops in share prices of French banks.",
        "Like Berlusconi, French President Nicolas Sarkozy moved to calm the markets and committed to lowering the deficit from 7.1 percent of GDP last year, to 3 percent of GDP by 2013, \"unrelated to economic developments\", and won ratification of the perfect credit rating by the three leading rating agencies.",
        "In Greece, too, the aid plan remains delayed after Finland's demand to receive collateral led to a similar demand from other countries in the eurozone.",
        "Since Greece cannot provide collateral against all the debt, it remains to be seen how the issue will play out.",
        "In China, retail sales, exports, and imports beat preliminary forecasts and raised hopes that the Chinese economy will compensate for moderating growth in the US and Europe.",

        "In the narrow forum, the directors of the Research and Market Operations Departments and two other participating members of management (the Deputy Governor and the Head of the Monetary and Finance Division of the Research Department) present their recommendations regarding the interest rate and, following a discussion, the Governor makes his decision.",
        "Most economic indicators published between the previous interest rate decision on June 27 and the current discussion on July 25 provide a firm basis for the assessment that economic activity is continuing to expand in the second quarter, but at a slower rate than in the first quarter.",
        "The main reason for the slower rate of growth was the rate decisions will be made by the Committee.",
        "reduction in goods exports, following their steep rise in the first quarter.",
        "The drop in exports combined with a moderate increase in imports resulted in a further increase in the trade deficit in the second quarter.",
        "Against the background of the continued narrowing of the output gap, the employment situation improved further, albeit moderately, and the nominal wage increased.",
        "The third estimate of the national accounts data for the first quarter of 2011 points to continued growth in economic activity (with a downward revision of the previous estimate): GDP grew by 4.6 percent, business sector product by 5.2 percent, private consumption excluding consumer durables by 4.9 percent, fixed investment by 26.1 percent, exports (excluding diamonds) by 12.8 percent, and imports (excluding diamonds) by 11.2 percent, imports (excluding diamonds) by 18 percent, and domestic public consumption increased by 2.9 percent, all at annual rates.",
        "Economic indicators that became available this month show that economic activity continued to expand in the second quarter, albeit more slowly than in the first quarter.",
        "The composite state-of-the-economy index for June increased by 0.2 percent, a continuation of the relatively modest increases in the last few months.",
        "In the second quarter the index rose by 0.7 percent, compared with an increase of 1.4 percent in the first quarter.",
        "The industry by industry picture shows that the slowdown in the rate of expansion derived mainly from the moderation of activity in the export industries.",
        "The Bank of Israel Companies Survey for the second quarter and the Central Bureau of Statistics trends survey for June reflect positive expectations of activity in the next few months, despite the decline in export sales.",
        "Although consumer confidence indices are maintaining their relatively high levels, it seems that global economic developments and geopolitical developments in Israel are having a negative effect on some of the components of expectations in these indices.",
        "Labor market data indicate a continued improvement in employment.",
        "According to trend data for May, the percentage of unemployed continued to fall, and reached 5.7 percent of the civilian workforce.",
        "The number of employee posts, seasonally adjusted, increased by 0.3 percent in the three months February–April compared with the previous three months.",
        "The number of vacancies increased by 8 percent in the second quarter compared with the number in the first quarter.",
        "The nominal wage increased in February–April by 1.1 percent (three-monthly rate, seasonally adjusted) compared with the level in the previous three months, while the real wage remained unchanged.",
        "Health tax receipts in June, which provide an indication of wage payments in that month, were 7.6 percent higher, in nominal terms, than in June 2010 (excluding the effect of legislative changes).",
        "The minimum monthly wage increased from NIS 3,900 to NIS 4,100 at the beginning of July.",
        "Goods exports excluding diamonds fell by 2.4 percent in the second quarter (quarterly rate of change), following two quarters of increases.",
        "Goods imports increased by 10.3 percent in the second quarter (import and export data are shown excluding diamonds, ships and aircraft, and are seasonally adjusted).",
        "Goods exports, and in particular manufactured goods exports, remained essentially unchanged in June (the first declining by 0.1 percent and the second increasing by 0.1 percent), following their decreases in April and May.",
        "Services exports (excluding start-ups) stabilized in April– May, after rising in the previous quarter.",
        "The upward trend in goods imports evident in the first quarter continued in the second, albeit at a more moderate pace.",
        "The slower increase was the result of a slowdown in the rate of increase in imports of capital goods, raw materials, and consumer durables.",
        "Tax revenues in January–June 2011 were 7.1 percent higher in real terms than in January–June 2010, and 0.3 percent above the seasonal path of the budget forecast.",
        "Government domestic activity in the first six months of the year (excluding credit) yielded a cumulative surplus of 0.3 percent of GDP, compared with a deficit of 1.1 percent of GDP in the same months last year.",
        "The inflation rate over the last 12 months was 4.2 percent, above the upper limit of the target inflation range (of 1–3 percent a year).",
        "The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by path consistent with achieving the inflation target.",
        "As was the case with the May index, housing and food prices contributed significantly again this month to the increase in the index.",
        "It was also noted that the seasonally adjusted rise in the index was slower in the last four months than in previous months.",
        "Forecasters inflation expectations for the next twelve months were at the same level as in the previous month, 2.9 percent, slightly below the upper limit of the target inflation range.",
        "Inflation expectations as calculated from the capital market also held steady, at an average of 3 percent.",
        "Alongside these expectations, the Bank of Israel interest rate one year from now based on the Telbor (Tel Aviv Inter-Bank Offered Rate) market is expected to be 4 percent, and the average of forecasters' predictions is that it will be 4.3 percent.",
        "Most forecasters expect the Bank of Israel to leave the interest rate for August unchanged.",
        "In the twelve months up to and including June, the M1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 8.4 percent, and the M2 aggregate In May there was a 0.4 percent increase in the balance of credit to the business sector, to a level of NIS 750 billion.",
        "The balance of credit to households rose by 1.5 percent in April and reached NIS 351 billion.",
        "Of this, outstanding housing credit increased in the twelve months to end-May by 14.4 percent, to NIS 246 billion; the increase in the twelve months to end-April stood at 14.1 percent.",
        "There was a decline in new mortgages granted in June, and as a result, for the first time since July 2009, total mortgages extended in the previous twelve months declined, by 1.4 percent.",
        "This contrasts with the usual trend of an increase in mortgages in the summer months.",
        "The share in total mortgages of mortgages at floating interest rates declined in June to 82 percent, compared with 88 percent in May.",
        "One of the reasons for the decline was the Bank of Israel directive which went into effect on May 5[th], which limits the share of floating interest rate housing credit.",
        "The effect of the directive is expected to be evident in the future too.",
        "The interest rates on all CPI-indexed and unindexed floating interest rate mortgage increased in June, while the rates on indexed mortgages at constant interest rates remained stable.",
        "The supply of houses continues to increase, and in the twelve months to April residential building starts totaled 41,583, an 11 percent increase compared to the number in the twelve months to April 2010.",
        "Completions in the twelve months to April totaled 33,941, a 7.9 percent increase compared with the number in the twelve months to April 2010.",
        "Since the beginning of the year there has been a marked decrease in the sale of new houses, and the number of houses for sale has increased.",
        "House prices––which are presented in the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of house prices but are not included in the CPI––increased in April–May at a rate of 0.7 percent a month, following their increase of 1.5 percent a month in March–April.",
        "The annual rate of increase in house prices declined slightly, but continues to be high, and in the twelve months ended in May, house prices increased by 13.7 percent; compared with a 14.5 percent increase in the previous month's figure.",
        "The housing index, which is based mainly on renewed rental contracts and which is included in the CPI, continued to increase, rising by 0.5 percent in June, bringing the increase in the last twelve months to 6.2 percent.",
        "The effect of the increase in the interest rate, measures introduced by the Bank of Israel affecting mortgages, and steps taken by the Ministry of Finance in real estate taxation, together with the continued increase in the number of building starts, are expected to be reflected in house prices in the course of the coming year.",
        "The Bank of Israel Research Department staff forecast is that inflation in the next twelve months will be 2.9 percent, with the interest rate increasing to an average of against the background of a 0.2 percentage point reduction in the forecast rise in the interest rate in the G4 countries,[2] both one quarter hence and one year hence, and a reduction of 0.3 percentage points in the GDP growth forecast of those countries one quarter ahead, and by 0.1 percentage points one year ahead.",
        "The Research Department emphasized the main risks facing Israel's economy: the realization of the pessimistic assessments regarding the global economic recovery and the its expected impact on demand for Israel's exports; and negative geopolitical developments.",
        "From the previous monetary policy discussion held on June 26, through July 22, the shekel appreciated by 1.6 percent against the dollar, lower than the appreciation of the main currencies against the dollar., Against the euro the shekel strengthened by about by about 0.6 percent.",
        "Between the monetary policy discussions of June 26 and July 22, most Tel Aviv Stock Exchange share price indices rose, in line with the general trend in stock markets abroad, but with lower volatility.",
        "The Tel Aviv 100 Index rose by 5.3 percent.",
        "New corporate bond issues totaled a gross NIS 5.5 billion in June, bringing the year to date total to about NIS 25 billion, similar to the amount in the corresponding period in During the period surveyed, yields on non-CPI-indexed government bonds decreased by 4-20 b.p., primarily in the medium range.",
        "Along the CPI-indexed government bonds curve the decline was more pronounced, between 20 and 35 b.p., with the curve becoming steeper.",
        "Yields on _makam decreased slightly, by 2–5 b.p., with the curve_ steepening a little.",
        "As a result of the increase in the interest rate in the eurozone last month, and prior to the Bank of Israel decision on the interest rate for August, the differential between the Bank of Israel interest rate and the ECB rate narrowed to 1.75 percentage points, and the differential between the Bank of Israel interest rate and the US federal funds rate remained unchanged at 3–3.25 percentage points.",
        "The yield gap between Israeli and US unindexed 10-year government notes narrowed in the last month, and at the end of the period was 218 b.p.",
        "(compared with 235 b.p.",
        "at the beginning of the period).",
        "Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by the five-year CDS declined over the month as a whole, to 138 b.p.",
        "The debt crisis in Europe spread to large eurozone countries, especially Italy.",
        "The credit rating companies lowered the ratings of Greece, Ireland and Portugal severely, and lowered the rating outlook of Italy and Spain.",
        "However, in the last few days, agreement was reached on a European aid program for Greece (which can also help other countries), a program that was better than expected, and thus calmed the markets somewhat.",
        "In the US too the debt continues to be headline news as a result of the inability to reach an agreement about increasing the debt ceiling and its attendant cuts.",
        "This has led to threats by the rating companies to lower the US credit rating in the near future.",
        "Most macroeconomic data published this month indicate weakness, as a result of which many investment houses reduced their annual growth forecasts, with expectations of some recovery in the second half of the year.",
        "Inflation remained high world wide, driven by the steep increase in commodity and energy prices in the last few months.",
        "This led to increases in interest rates in the rapidly growing emerging market economies, and even in Europe.",
        "The Fed, however, which focuses on the core index, assessed that this was a temporary development, and that inflation would decline again and would not be reflected in the core index.",
        "At the same time, in light of the complex reality of inflation on one side and concern over growth on the other, the general assessment is that increases in the interest rate will be more moderate than had been expected in the last few months.",
        "In the monthly narrow-forum monetary policy discussion, four members of management make recommendations to the Governor regarding the appropriate rate of interest for the economy.",
        "In the current discussions on the interest rate for August, one of them recommended that the Governor increase the interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, and the other three members recommended that he leave the interest rate unchanged.",
        "As stated in previous reports of interest rate decisions, the Bank of Israel is implementing a policy consistent with the process of gradually restoring a more normal interest rate environment—a process aimed at stabilizing inflation within the target range, and supporting further growth of economic activity while maintaining financial stability.",
        "The pace of interest rate increases is not fixed, but depends on the inflation environment, growth in Israel and globally, the monetary policies of the major central banks, and the exchange rates of the shekel.",
        "Leaving the rate of interest for August unchanged at 3.25 percent is consistent with that process, and at that level, monetary policy continues to be expansionary.",
        "Several issues were discussed, the main ones being the inflation environment and inflation expectations, house prices, expectations for real economic activity, and the effect of global economic developments on Israel's economy and on the exchange rate of the shekel.",
        "With regard to the level of inflation and inflation expectations, the point was made that despite the fact that the inflation environment in the last few months indicates some moderation relative to the level in the previous months, it is still close to the upper limit of the target inflation range.",
        "Inflation expectations and the average of forecasters' predictions of inflation in the next twelve months are stable at the upper end of the target range and are not in the middle of the range.",
        "These facts and the low level of the real interest rate argue in favor of an increase in the interest rate.",
        "On house prices, it was stated that viewed over the previous twelve months there was a slight slowdown in the rate of increase, but it is still high.",
        "Nevertheless, the assessment is that the increase in building starts over the last twelve months and the various policy measures introduced by the Bank of Israel and the Ministry of Finance to moderate the rate of price increases will start to take effect in the next few months, which will lead to a decline in the rate of increase of house prices.",
        "With regard to the environment of real economic activity, the discussion focused mainly on developments in exports and wages, against the background of assessments of slower growth in the second quarter than in the first.",
        "The slowdown in export growth in the second quarter was mainly due to the decline in manufactured goods exports in the last few months, which occurred as a result of the fall in demand from abroad.",
        "That said, manufacturing production has not yet been affected, and (till May) has shown growth.",
        "Services exports (till May), however, were stable at the same level as in the first quarter.",
        "The increase in the nominal wage in the twelve months to April may mark the start of an upward wage trend.",
        "This is due to the continued decline in the rate of unemployment to its lowest level since 1987, which may exert upward pressure on wages.",
        "However, it is still too early to state that rising wages are causing inflationary pressures.",
        "Developments in the global economy and their impact on Israel's economy constituted one of the main issues discussed.",
        "The lowering of growth forecasts in the major world economies is expected to reduce demand from abroad and to lead to a decline in exports.",
        "At the same time interest rates in the main economies are not predicted to increase in the near future, and in the eurozone the expected path of the ECB interest rate was actually lowered following the latest increase in the interest rate.",
        "Concern that the global economy may be on the brink of a downturn (a double dip) is based also on actual developments, not just forecasts: world trade indices were stable in April–May; Israel's goods exports moderated; in the US there has already been a slowdown, and negative labor market data have been published; and the debt crisis in Europe has already resulted in reduced credit ratings for Greece, Portugal and Ireland, with the possibility of the possible downgrading of Italy and Spain as well.",
        "These developments raise the level of uncertainty at this time, and justify a cautious monetary policy.",
        "The exchange rate was discussed in the context of the differentials between the interest rate in Israel and those in the major economies.",
        "Despite the increase in the European Central Bank (ECB) interest rate last month, the postponement of the expected timing of the next increase in the interest rate in Europe and especially in the US as derived from the financial markets and from forecasters' predictions could lead to growing pressures for appreciation of the shekel as a result of the expected interest rate differentials.",
        "The issue of the exchange rate also arose in the discussion of the effect of the possible implications of lack of agreement regarding the increase of the debt ceiling in the US, and also in the context of geopolitical developments in the Middle East.",
        "Taking into consideration the high degree of uncertainty regarding the debt crises in the US and in Europe; the slowdown in the global economy and its expected negative effect of Israel's growth already in the second quarter; the interest rate differentials between Israel and the major economies; the moderation of actual inflation, the stable inflation expectations and inflation forecasts; the assessment that the interest rate increases and the measures introduced in the real estate sector will soon start to have an effect, three members of the narrow forum recommended leaving the interest rate unchanged for August.",
        "That would be consistent with the gradual return to a normal interest rate environment in light of the cumulative increases since the beginning of the year, and is also consistent with the efforts to gradually attain the inflation target, taking into account the other considerations described above.",
        "One member of management recommended that the Governor increase the interest rate by 0.25 percentage points because the rate was not changed in the previous month and there is agreement that it should be increased further in the future.",
        "This, in light of the fact that inflation expectations are at the upper limit of the target range.",
        "That member of management argued that some slowdown currently in the real rate of growth is consistent with a sustainable growth rate.",
        "Furthermore, in his opinion the current rate of interest is lower than that appropriate to equilibrium in the domestic asset markets in light of the persistent increase in house prices and the continued increase in outstanding mortgages.",
        "This, even taking into account the interest rate differentials between Israel and the major economies.",
        "Taking all the above points into consideration, the Governor decided to leave the interest rate for August unchanged at 3.25 percent.",
        "In its announcement of the decision, the Bank of Israel emphasized the following points: - Inflation over the previous twelve months, 4.2 percent, continues to be high.",
        "However, the seasonally adjusted CPI inflation rates in the last four months are in line with the target inflation range.",
        "Forecasters’ inflation expectations for the next twelve months remained steady at slightly below the upper limit of the target range.",
        "Forecasters' inflation expectations and those derived from the capital market go together with the assessment that the Bank of Israel will continue to increase the interest rate, but at a slower pace than in the first half of the year.",
        "- Most economic indicators published this month support the assessment that the rate of growth in economic activity in Israel moderated in the second quarter primarily as a result of the slower expansion of goods exports.",
        "In addition, developments in debt crises, the weakness of the US economy, and geopolitical risks, increase uncertainty about the pace of economic growth.",
        "- The annual rate of increase in house prices continues to be high––in the twelve months to May house prices increased by 13.7 percent, slightly below the rate in the twelve months to April.",
        "With that, the effect of interest rate increases, steps by the Bank of Israel in the mortgage market, and steps by the Ministry of Finance regarding real estate taxation, together with the continued increase in building starts, are expected to affect housing prices during the coming year, although it is too early at this stage to see clear evidence of their effect on house prices in the data currently available.",
        "- Central bank interest rates in the major advanced economies are still low, and are expected to remain so for a long time.",
        "Concern of a slowdown in US growth and the worsening of the debt crises in Europe led to expectations of a slowdown in the pace of interest rate increases in the US and Europe.",
        "In its announcement the Bank of Israel stated that in the first half of the year it had raised the interest rate markedly.",
        "At the same time, steps were taken by the Bank and the Ministry of Finance in the housing market.",
        "In addition, the shekel appreciated in the last few months and there was a decline in commodity prices.",
        "The impact on inflation of these developments is expected to continue to be felt in the future.",
        "In light of these issues, and the marked increase of risks in the global economy, it was decided to leave the interest rate at its current level.",
        "The Bank of Israel stated that it will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli economy and the global economy and in the financial markets.",
        "The Bank will use the instruments available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, including keeping a close watch on developments in the assets market, and especially in the housing market.",
        "The decision was announced on July 25, 2011.",
        "Director of the Research Department Finance Division, Research Department Most macroeconomic data published during the month reflected weak economic performance, purchasing managers indices (PMIs) in all countries showed a downward trend, and in some (including Italy) they declined to a level that reflects contraction.",
        "In China too the PMI is approaching 50,[1] which may suggest that the positive figures published there might relate to a temporary situation.",
        "In the US too the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) manufacturing indices were relatively buoyant, but they were strongly affected by the inventories component which is recovering, following the earthquake in Japan, whereas the forward-looking disappointing.",
        "Inflation around the world is still higher than it should be, reflecting the effect of the commodity and energy prices that have increased steeply this year.",
        "Commodity prices, which continued upwards this month, add to concern over inflation mainly in the emerging market economies.",
        "The 12 percent increase in oil prices and the 6 percent increase in the price of gold––used for hedging––were particularly notable.",
        "Expectations of increases in interest rates in the advanced economies calculated from the markets dropped considerably this month following the publication of the weak economic data.",
        "Thus, no increases in interest rates in the US and Europe are expected before the end of 2012, and Australia is even expected to make a cut in its rate in the near future.",
        "The US debt is the focus of a difficult problem, with a long political dispute raging about raising the debt ceiling and about significant fiscal cuts (this dispute must be settled in the next few days to avoid the technical default of the government at the beginning of August).",
        "The credit rating agencies Moody's and S&P actually put the US on negative review and warned explicitly about downgrading the US rating already from next month.",
        "In its announcement, S&P warned of a downgrade even if an agreement is reached, if it contains a non-credible downward path for the debt and the deficit in the foreseeable future.",
        "[2] Although the probability of a downgrade is still low, it is certainly a possibility, and adds to the great uncertainty in the markets.",
        "Other data published, relating to the labor market, showed an increase of only 18,000 jobs (compared with the forecast of 105,000).",
        "Unemployment increased to 9.2 percent known as SDs (selective defaults), which means that a country fails to meet part of its liabilities.",
        "lowest level for decades); The number of hours worked per week dropped; and hourly income also fell––all these, together with the standstill in the real estate market, emphasize the extent of the problem.",
        "Nevertheless, the forecasters and the Fed continue with their assessment that at least part of the recent slowdown is due to temporary factors, including the severe winter weather that adversely impacted on the construction industry, the damage to the supply chain caused by the earthquake in Japan, and the increase in commodity (in particular fuel) prices to levels that affect consumption and growth, and they therefore hope that the US market will improve in the second half of the year.",
        "In addition, in light of the increase of only 1.2 percent in the core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) index for May (which although higher than had been expected, is still not high), the Chairman of the Fed claims that the price increases (and their severe adverse effects on the purchasing power of US consumers) are temporary, and he therefore continues to feel more concerned over deflation.",
        "The interest rate in the eurozone was increased to 1.5 percent because inflation had reached 2.7 percent, in excess of the ECB inflation target.",
        "This hike in the interest rate imposes an even greater burden on the \"peripheral\" European countries, which are already finding it difficult to grow, in light of the significant fiscal cuts and lack of competitiveness and in light of the spreading European debt crisis.",
        "This month attention was focused on Italy and its large fiscal debt (119 percent of GDP), a high fiscal deficit, low level of competitiveness, (growth was only 1 percent in 2010), a 3 percent deficit in the current account, and political difficulties that raise doubts about the government's determination (and ability) to the necessary steps.",
        "Even though Italy's economy is in a considerably better condition than those of Portugal, Ireland and Greece, whose ratings were cut sharply this month,[3] the size of Italy's economy that raise doubts as to the ability of the ECB or the IMF to help it if necessary, means that it represents a threat to the stability of the whole eurozone.",
        "At the end of the period reviewed, an agreement was reached in Europe about an aid program for Greece (with the possibility of helping Portugal and Ireland too) which was better than the markets had expected.",
        "The main points of the program are: a significant postponement of the repayment period of Greece's debt, a marked reduction in the interest Greece will pay, private sector participation in the costs of the program (which was approved by the Institute of International Finance[4]), and enabling the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) to buy bonds of countries in difficulty on the secondary market.",
        "However, many significant details are still missing from the program, and this, combined with the persistent objection of the rating companies to the voluntary participation of private investors in the cost of the Greece rescue,[5] is likely to make the rescue of countries in difficulty more problematic and to lead to the spread of the crisis to core European countries.",
        "Such a spread could occur due to, among other things, the heavy exposure of French banks to Greece's and Italy's bonds (according to 2010 BIS data).",
        "Inflation in the emerging markets, led by China where inflation reached 6.4 percent, a three-year high, led to increases in interest rates.",
        "China's premier, Wen Jiabau, stressed that price restraint was a top policy priority.",
        "Nonetheless, China continued to publish very buoyant economic data, most of which exceeded expectations: growth at an annual rate of 9.5 percent in the first quarter of 2011 (compared with the forecast of 9.3 percent), an improved surplus in the trade balance, an increase in retail sales, an increase in housing loans, an increase in manufacturing production, and rises in house prices––all these increases were greater than the forecasts.",
        "However, in China too there is a debt problem, focused mainly on domestic government debts in excess of previous assessments, a large proportion of which are problem debts, which led Moody's to state that constituted a threat to the stability of banks and their ratings.",
        "Concerns in the financial markets over debt crises and loss of momentum in the advanced economies persisted and even intensified this month.",
        "However, at the end of the period, following the publication of the European aid program, the markets calmed somewhat.",
        "Taking the period as a whole, share prices in the advanced economies increased by 5.7 percent, and in the emerging market economies by 3.2 percent,[6] and the Vix index (implied volatility of options) declined.",
        "However, the major feature of the period was the high volatility and the soaring level of uncertainty, as reflected by the figure published by the AAII (the American Association of Individual Investors) showing that the public's holding of shares plunged by 59.5 percent, its first decline in nine months (falling below the long-term average), but the holding of government bonds also dropped, with a switch to cash.",
        "[7] Portugal, Ireland and Greece stood out with steep drops in share prices, with yields on government bonds and CDS spreads (again) reaching peak levels.",
        "[8] The ending of the QE2 increase in the US debt ceiling are not reflected as yet in the bond markets, and yields in the US (and also in Germany) continue to be at a low level of less than 3 percent.",
        "probably indicates a change in preferences regarding the US.",
        "spread continue to be very high.",
        "In the process of making the monthly interest rate decision by the Monetary Committee, discussions are held at two levels––the first in a broad forum, and the second in a narrower one.",
        "In the broad-forum discussion, the relevant background economic conditions are presented, including real, monetary and financial developments in Israel’s economy, and developments in the global economy.",

        "Goods imports were virtually unchanged (at a relatively low level, compared with their levels at the beginning of the year), a result of a moderate increase in imports of consumer goods and production inputs alongside a continued decline in raw materials imports.",

        "There were 43,058 building starts in the twelve months to September, and the number of completions was available for sale continued to increase, and in September–November was on average The moderation in the rate on increase of home prices comes against the background of the continued increase in the number of building starts, the lagged effect of the increase in the interest rate, measures introduced by the Bank of Israel affecting mortgages, and steps taken by the Ministry of Finance in real estate taxation.",

        "Central banks in other countries also cut their interest rates, against the background of the global economic situation.",
        "Participants in the discussion dealt with several issues.",
        "The major issues were (1) developments in the global economy, (2) the slowdown in growth in Israel and the risks posed to Israel's economy by economic developments world wide, and (3) the question of whether to leave the interest rate unchanged this month, after its reduction the previous month, or to lower it.",
        "In their assessment of the state of the world economy, members of the Monetary Committee pointed to both positive and negative developments over the previous month.",
        "Positive developments include the interest rate reduction by the ECB, extensive loans offered by the ECB, at easy terms, to commercial banks in the eurozone, and the move to reduce the interest rate on their dollar swap lines.",
        "These activities provide much more liquidity, and can contribute to stabilizing the banks.",
        "It was noted that these actions constitute further monetary easing, in addition to the ECB interest rate reduction.",
        "It was also noted that other central banks reduced interest rates in the previous month, and that the interest rate level in the US remains very low.",
        "These developments indicate an improvement in dealing with the crisis.",
        "Negative developments discussed were the downward revision of forecasts in most European countries, and signs of a slowdown in growth in major emerging markets.",
        "Regarding real economic activity in Israel, participants agreed that all the economic indicators that became available this month continue to indicate a slowdown in growth, stemming primarily from a drop in demand.",
        "Regarding prices, Committee members agreed that the inflation environment was comfortable: actual inflation and inflation expectations are near the midpoint of the target inflation range, and a slight decline has been observed in home prices.",
        "In terms of the exchange rate, one Committee member claimed that in his assessment, most changes in currency markets today come from changes in risk premiums, so that the interest rate gap between Israel and leading economies has a more moderate impact on the changes in the exchange rate.",
        "Another issue discussed was the impact on Israel's economy of developments in the global economy.",
        "In terms of exports, it was claimed that the increase in the Tech Pulse Index in the US is encouraging for Israeli exports because the index serves as an indicator of demand in the high tech sector.",
        "However, the slowdown in growth in emerging markets is liable to make it difficult to redirect exports to them, in response to the slowdown in activity in developed markets.",
        "In any case, the general opinion in the discussion was that at this time there is a high probability that Europe will experience recession, though the probability of a financial crisis has decreased.",
        "Those in favor of leaving the interest rate at its current level contended that the data that became available this month did not support the view that an additional interest rate reduction was required, after the cut the previous month.",
        "Those who supported this reasoning noted primarily the policy steps taken by central banks around the world, including by the ECB, and the assessment that the probability of a financial crisis had decreased.",
        "It was also noted that even at the current level of the interest rate, monetary policy is expansionary, after the reductions in recent months in response to global developments and a slowdown in growth in Israel.",
        "In addition, the current interest rate level is comfortable since it creates a monetary environment which allows room for maneuver in the event of a further deterioration in the economic situation.",
        "It was also noted that at this time, a more expansionary policy is liable to have undesired consequences on asset prices.",
        "In contrast, one member of the Committee said that in his opinion, the additional data which became available—primarily the slowdown in growth in Israel, the continuing crisis in Europe, and the slowdown in growth in emerging markets—clearly indicate a negative trend, and due to the lagged effect of monetary policy, it is appropriate to reduce the interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, as a preemptive step.",
        "It was also argued that in light of the monetary policy in leading economies, the gap between the extent of monetary expansion in Israel and in those countries might impact exports through appreciation of the shekel.",
        "Following the discussion, the six members of the Monetary Committee voted on the appropriate rate of interest for January 2012.",
        "Five members of the Committee voted in favor of keeping the interest rate at its current level, and one Committee member voted in favor of reducing the interest rate by 0.25 percentage points.",
        "In announcing the decision, the Bank of Israel emphasized the following points that led to the decision to leave the interest rate unchanged at 2.75 percent for January - Inflation forecasts for the next twelve months––those calculated from the capital market, those of the forecasters and that of the Bank of Israel––are all close to the midpoint of the target inflation range.",
        "Actual inflation over the last twelve months is continuing to settle more firmly within the target inflation range.",
        "- Indicators of economic activity in Israel continue to support the assessment that the economy is still expanding, although more slowly than at the beginning of the year and during last year.",
        "According to Bank of Israel assessments, the economy is expected to grow in 2012 at a rate of 2.8 percent.",
        "Most of the slowdown in growth derives from the weakness of exports, against the background of the weakness in the global economy; a moderation in domestic demand is also evident.",
        "- Against the background of measures taken by the ECB this month, financial markets around the world improved somewhat.",
        "In the US, economic data continue to indicate an improvement in the economic situation.",
        "Data on economic activity in Europe, however, support the assessment that a recession is likely to start in the eurozone in the course of 2012.",
        "Several leading emerging countries are also showing signs of a slowdown in growth.",
        "Uncertainty regarding developments in the global economy remains high, and impacts on the level of uncertainty regarding economic developments in Israel.",
        "- The persistent negative trends in Europe led to another cut in the ECB interest rate, following the cut last month.",
        "The ECB also took steps to increase liquidity in the banks significantly.",
        "Other countries also cut their interest rates.",
        "The markets are not pricing in an increase in the interest rate in the coming year in any of the central banks of the large advanced economies.",
        "The Fed, it will be recalled, declared that the federal funds rate will remain at a near-zero level till mid-2013 at least.",
        "The Fed continues with its quantitative easing measures.",
        "The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli economy and the global economy and in financial markets.",
        "The Bank will use the tools available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, including keeping a close watch on developments in assets markets, including the housing market.",
        "The debt crisis in Europe is deepening and spreading, as is reflected in announcements by the various rating agencies: S&P announced at the beginning of December that fifteen countries, including some with an AAA rating, are at risk of being downgraded, some even by two notches.",
        "The official reason for the announcement was the impression created of the difficulty of leaders of the eurozone and the EU to make decisions, which indicates an inherent weakness in the decision making process.",
        "The rating agencies' announcements raised the expectations that Europe's leadership would end the Brussels conference with a fiscal union and/or would grant the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) a banking license,[1] and thus would control the process of fiscal tightening as well as the soaring yields on Italy's and Spain's bonds.",
        "The hopes, however, were dashed.",
        "The main decisions reached at the conference obliged member countries to avoid annual deficits of more than 0.5 percent of GDP, and imposed automatic sanctions on any country whose annual deficit will exceed 3 percent of GDP; brought forward the operation of the ESM to July 2012 alongside the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), but without a banking license; raising increase the share of the participation of the private sector in the rescue plan.",
        "The Brussels conference did not calm the rating agencies: Fitch announced that it was liable to reduce France's credit rating within two years, and Moody's reduced Belgium's rating two notches.",
        "At the same time the rating agencies also cut the ratings of many European banks against the background of the effect of financial regulations and market fluctuations on the banking sector and the reduced probability of broad government support for the banks in light of the crisis.",
        "The results of stress tests published by the European Banking Authority (EBA) showed that banks in the EU would have to raise additional capital of about €114.7 billion in order to increase their capital adequacy ratio to 9 percent by June 2012, so as to ensure their ability to withstand the shocks caused by the European debt crisis.",
        "Against the background of the drop in bank share prices, some banks are trying to increase their capital ratio by selling assets instead of or in addition to raising capital.",
        "Lack of bank stability is likely to hasten the decline in the markets, and of course the opposite also holds.",
        "Against the background of the lack of confidence in European leaders, the role of the ECB in a solution to the crisis assumes even greater importance.",
        "Mario Draghi, the President of the ECB, is firmly opposed to financing the debt of peripheral European significantly reduce their yield, and hence would calm the markets.",
        "countries in general, and of Italy and Spain in particular, because of concern over moral hazard and an upsurge in inflation in Europe, and therefore indicated that he would not step up bond purchases.",
        "He did, however, cut the eurozone interest rate by and he announced other measures to increase liquidity, that would help the European banking sector.",
        "As part of that decision, the ECB agreed to relax some of the requirements regarding collateral from the banks, and announced that it would allow full allotment of loans for periods of up to three years (as opposed to one year hitherto).",
        "The intention was to ease the financing difficulties of European banks that must repay some €230 billion of loans in the first quarter of 2012, and currently hesitate to lend each other money, and thus to increase the extent of loans granted by the banks to companies and households.",
        "In the first week of the arrangement alone the banks borrowed €490 billion at the central bank interest rate of only 1 percent.",
        "This step strengthened the euro and led to optimistic expectations regarding an increase in demand for European government bonds.",
        "Against the above background, in the period under review the yields on 10-year Italian bonds fell from 7.24 percent to 5.84 percent, but rose again to 6.75 percent following the disappointment at the decisions of the Brussels conference, and an issue of 5-year bonds closed with a yield of 6.47 percent.",
        "Nevertheless, over the period there was a steepening of the yield curve slope for other terms, with a sharp drop of which is likely to ease the situation significantly for future issues.",
        "Yields on Spain's up again to 5.27 percent.",
        "The yield curve on Spanish government bonds also steepened markedly, with a fall of 250–370 b.p.",
        "for up to two years and a drop of bond issues during the period, with yields lower than those a month earlier, and with a higher coverage ratio.",
        "The ECB expects the eurozone economy growth rate for 2011 to be 1.6 percent, but reduced the forecast for 2012 to only 0.3 percent, compared with its previous forecast of 1.3 percent.",
        "It also provided its first forecast for 2013, predicting a recovery in the rate of growth to 1.3 percent.",
        "It also expects the rate of inflation in 2011 to come to the continued disappointing macroeconomic figures for Europe, expect a contraction of 0.7 percent in the eurozone, so that the global growth rate will be only 2.9 percent, compared with their previous forecast of 3.2 percent a month ago.",
        "The macroeconomic data for the US continues to be encouraging, with most figures exceeding the forecasts and indicating an improvement, albeit a moderate one, compared with previous months.",
        "The main factor boosting growth seems to be private consumption, with some support also from the real estate market: November saw the largest monthly increase in a year in the number of home sale contracts signed, and the number of building starts surged by 9 percent above the number in the previous month.",
        "Orders from factories, however, retail sales, and industrial production were all disappointing.",
        "As expected, the Fed left the interest rate unchanged, and repeated that it expected the near-zero rate to remain until mid-2013 at least, but it did not announce another quantitative easing program (QE3).",
        "It seems that as long as the macroeconomic data continue to show an improvement in the economic situation, however modest, the Fed will avoid using the little ammunition it has available, and will delay another QE program as much as possible.",
        "The Fed also stated in its release accompanying the interest rate statement that the US economy is continuing to grow at a moderate pace despite the indications of a slowdown in the global economy, and it noted that there were signs of a recovery in the labor market.",
        "It does indeed seem, on the surface, that the labor market has improved significantly, but a closer look reveals that the situation is not so clear.",
        "Although the unemployment rate dropped from 9 percent to only 8.6 percent, but alongside the increase of 278,000 employees, the decline of about in a drop in the rate of participation from 64.2 percent to only 64 percent.",
        "The monthly rate of additions to non-farm payrolls continued to be encouraging, and on average over the last twelve months was 133,000.",
        "Nonetheless, the number of unemployed is still very high, with about 13.3 million people out of work, with the current rate of new jobs that become available just able to prevent an increase in the unemployment rate, as a similar number of people join the labor force each month.",
        "Although the real estate market was a little encouraging this month, it is not managing to start a real recovery, although the rate of interest on 30-year mortgages is at an alltime low of 4.12 percent.",
        "One of the primary problems of the real estate market is the banks' conservative approach to mortgage financing, as a lesson of the sub-prime crisis.",
        "According to data from the National Association of Realtors in the US, a record rate of 33 percent of pending real estate sales did not reach closing, due to, among other reasons, declines in the value of homes and tougher requirements from banks.",
        "The government's focused plans to ease credit terms for real estate and improve employment, and a QE3 which will focus on mortgages are likely to contribute to noticeable improvement in these two markets which depend on each other and which have been floundering since the beginning of the crisis.",
        "Political disagreements continue to make it difficult to pass plans to boost the economy.",
        "During the month of December, Democrats and Republicans succeeded in reaching agreement on extending tax reductions for another two months, not for a full year as had been expected.",
        "The main dispute between the parties is on the source of financing the breaks.",
        "The Republicans want budget cuts, while the Democrats argue for increasing taxes on the wealthy, as the tax breaks for the wealthiest 2 percent cost the US government about $700 billion per year.",
        "With that, it should be noted that the extension itself is a point of disagreement, since although not extending the cuts is liable to cut 1 percent from growth in 2012, the plan is in some ways pushes the problem to a later date, and is expected to deepen the deficit and is liable to lead to higher yields on US bonds.",
        "In summary, it appears that the US economy continues to grow at moderate pace, with investment houses forecasting 2.1 percent growth for the US economy in 2012.",
        "With that, the situation is very fragile, and as Federal Reserve Bank Chairman Bernanke said, the pressures in the financial markets are a significant risk to the downside.",
        "Activity in emerging markets remains strong, though a significant slowdown in growth can be seen.",
        "In China, macroeconomic figures clearly indicate a slowdown in growth, due to a decline in industrial production as well as in exports to Europe.",
        "This situation may lower China's motivation to allow the yuan to appreciate, and thus renew the tension with the US about the manipulated value of the yuan.",
        "The concern of a slowdown can be seen in the central bank's decision to reduce, for the first time in a while, the reserve ratio for banks by 50 basis points, and in the reduction in corporate income tax rates for small companies for the next three years.",
        "In addition, the risk of the banking sector's exposure to China's real estate bubble remains.",
        "A Bloomberg survey shows that most investors believe that China will face a banking crisis within the next five years.",
        "In India, very weak data was reported, indicating a slowdown.",
        "In the third quarter, growth was only 6.9 percent, the slowest rate of growth since the second quarter of 2009.",
        "Despite the slowdown in growth, accompanied by a decline in the rate of inflation, the Reserve Bank of India refrained from reducing the interest rate, against the background of, among other things, the weakness of the rupee during the month to a historic low against the dollar.",
        "Brazil recorded growth of only 2.1 percent in the third quarter, the lowest level in two years, and in the fourth quarter did not grow at all.",
        "Against the background of the slowdown in growth and the rate of inflation which declined to only 6.1 percent (compared with basis points to 11 percent, a cumulative cut of 150 basis points since August.",
        "During the period reviewed, stock market indices in the US increased 5.3 percent, and for Europe increased 3.7 percent, while stock market indices in China declined 7 percent and in India declined by 2 percent.",

        "If the vote is tied, the chairperson (the Governor) has an additional vote.",
        "Economic indicators that became available this month support the assessment that in the third quarter and in October the slowdown in the rate of growth of economic activity and of demand continued.",
        "With that, these figures are currently consistent with the Bank of Israel forecast of 4.7 percent growth in 2011.",
        "According to National Accounts figures for the third quarter similar to its growth rate in the previous quarter; business product grew 5.3 percent, compared with 2.7 percent in the previous quarter; private consumption increased by formation increased by 17.8 percent, compared with 9.3 percent in the previous quarter; exports declined 16.9 percent, compared with growth of 1.5 percent in the previous quarter; and imports declined by 7.6 percent compared with a growth of 9.2 percent in the previous quarter.",

        "Foreign trade figures show stability of exports at a relatively low level, and a decline in imports.",
        "The stability of exports reflects an increase in exports by high technology industries, which was offset by a decrease in exports by medium high, medium low, and low technology companies.",
        "Trend figures show that high technology exports are on a downward path while mixed to high technology industries are on a rising one.",
        "The decline in goods imports comprised all of its components and was prominent especially in consumer goods imports and investment goods imports—the decline in which reflects a marked drop in machinery and equipment imports.",
        "Government domestic revenues for the year to date through October were 2.7 percent lower than the seasonal path of the budget forecast, primarily due to a continued slowdown in indirect tax receipts, which began in April.",

        "Makam yields increased slightly for maturities of up to 8 months, and declined slightly in longer terms.",
        "The yield for one year fell during the period from 2.8 percent to 2.7 percent—against the background of an exit from risk assets and expectations of continued interest rate cuts by the Bank of Israel, and despite the continued exit of nonresidents from makam.",
        "The yield gap between Israeli 10-year government bonds and equivalent 10-year US Treasury securities widened to about 270 basis points from 250 basis points in the previous month In the twelve months ending in October, the M1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 2 percent, and the M2 aggregate (M1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 14.1 percent.",

        "The share of unindexed floating rate mortgages extended in October was 26.6 percent, after reaching 26.1 percent in August, far lower than the record levels of the first quarter of 2009 of about 75 percent––a decline which was partly due to the limitations imposed by the Bank of Israel on some floating interest rate housing loans .",

        "Housing prices reflected in the housing index, which is based mainly on renewed rental contracts and which is included in the CPI, declined 0.3 percent in October, but over the 12 months ending in October they increased by 6.3 percent—compared with an increase of 5.5 percent in the 12 months ending in September—and prices are expected, according to the Research Department forecast, to continue to increase at a similar pace in the coming year.",
        "Home prices, which are published in the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of home prices but are not included in the CPI, declined in August–September by 0.2 percent (the first decline since December 2008) after an increase of 0.6 percent in July–August.",
        "The annual rate of increase in home prices also moderated—in the 12 months ending in September the rate was 10.5 percent, compared with 12.1 percent in the 12 months ending in August, and this after levels of around 20 percent in 2010.",
        "The moderation in home prices comes against the background of the continued increase in the number of building starts, the lagged effect of the increase in the interest rate, measures introduced by the Bank of Israel affecting mortgages, and steps taken by the Ministry of Finance in real estate taxation.",
        "The effect of these moves is expected to continue and be evident going forward.",
        "According to the Research Department's end of September staff forecast, inflation over the four quarters ending in the third quarter of 2012 will be 2.3 percent, and the average interest rate for 2012 will be 3 percent.",

        "Last month credit rating companies made further cuts in the rating of European countries, and warned of the credit rating outlook of other countries and of banks around the world.",
        "Macroeconomic figures published this month in the US were relatively favorable, and were generally better than expected.",
        "Data published in Europe were weaker, and many forecasters and investment houses expect that Europe will slip into a recession that is likely to deteriorate in light of the austerity measures announced in several countries.",
        "Inflation around the world is starting to moderate, and commodity prices that fell sharply are expected to reduce it further, but the increase in oil prices this year, constitutes a burden on the already weak global economy.",
        "Against the background of these developments, the ECB made a surprise cut in the interest rate this month, and the markets are pricing in interest rate cuts in other economies.",
        "Participants in the discussion dealt with several issues.",
        "The major issues were the assessment of real economic activity, economic developments world wide and the risks they pose to the Israeli economy, housing prices, inflation and the foreign exchange market.",
        "Regarding real economic activity, participants agreed that economic indicators that became available this month support the assessment that in the third quarter and in October the slowdown in the rate of growth of economic activity and of demand continued.",
        "The sharp decline in exports of goods and services was also mentioned, as well as the moderate growth of private consumption.",
        "Additionally, one committee member remarked that the continued decline in financial markets is liable to reduce domestic demand.",
        "With that, it was noted that the level of domestic activity remains high, and its moderation is a result of the worsening crisis in Europe, which is expected to continue to have a negative impact in the future, if the crisis worsens.",
        "A central topic of discussion was the uncertainty around the European crisis, and its effect on economic activity in Israel.",
        "Participants in the discussion agreed that the probability of the crisis in Europe worsening has increased since the previous discussion, and they noted, among other things, that yields on government bonds of Italy and Spain have reached high levels.",
        "Another issue discussed was home prices, and the fact that these had fallen in August– September, the first decline since December 2008.",
        "The continued increase in the number of building starts was also referred to.",
        "Members of the Committee were of the opinion that the limitation imposed by the Bank of Israel on some mortgages reduces the effect of a cut in the Bank's interest rate on the average rate of interest on mortgages, so that the limitation is expected to continue to exert a moderating effect on home prices.",
        "One member stated that he was not concerned about a continued rise in home prices, but just the opposite, a too rapid drop in their prices.",
        "In the discussion of the foreign exchange market it was stated that since the previous monetary policy discussion held on October 23, through November 25, the shekel had depreciated by about 3.8 percent against the dollar and reached NIS 3.79.",
        "If the exchange rate continues around this level, it will help exports.",
        "The point was made that a cut in the interest rate could contribute to the further weakening of the shekel, and thus perhaps increase inflation to some extent in the future.",
        "The main considerations in favor of leaving the interest rate unchanged were: domestic activity which remains buoyant, as seen in, inter alia, the low unemployment rate and the increase in investments; the recent shekel weakness which supports exports; and concern that reducing the interest rate will halt the moderation in the rate of increase in home prices.",
        "With regard to the uncertainty regarding how the European crisis will develop and how it will affect Israel's economy, the Bank of Israel would have the tools and the ability to respond quickly and effectively to such developments.",
        "The main arguments in favor of a quarter-percentage-point cut in the interest rate were the continued slowdown in the growth of real economic activity, the persistent decline in the financial markets that is expected to dampen domestic demand, the assessment that the risk of Europe slipping into a recession had risen, the significant slowdown in the global economy, which is already affecting the Israeli economy, and the fact that steps have to be taken before the crisis deteriorates, due to the lagged effect of changes in the interest rate on real economic activity.",
        "The six members of the Monetary Committee who participate in the discussion decide on the appropriate rate of interest for the economy.",
        "In the discussions on the interest rate for December, four members of the Committee voted in favor of reducing the interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, while the two other members of the Committee voted in favor of leaving the interest rate unchanged.",
        "In announcing the decision, the Bank of Israel emphasized the following points that led to the decision to lower the interest rate to 2.75 percent for December 2011: - The debt crisis in Europe is becoming more severe and is spreading to other countries, and there is growing concern over its potentially strong impact on the global economy.",
        "Yields on government bonds of Italy and Spain have reached high and apparently unsustainable levels.",
        "In light of the weak economic data published in Europe, the risk of Europe sliding into a recession and a significant slowdown in the global economy has risen.",
        "These negative developments are already affecting the Israeli economy, and their effect is expected to intensify.",
        "- Economic indicators that became available this month support the assessment that in the third quarter and in October the slowdown in the rate of growth of economic activity continued.",
        "Most of the slowdown in the domestic economy resulted from the easing in global demand and its effect on exports, and also to some extent from the slackening of domestic demand.",
        "- Inflation forecasts for the next twelve months as calculated from the capital market, those of the forecasters and that of the Bank of Israel are all close to the midpoint of the target inflation range.",
        "Actual inflation over the last twelve months is within the target range, and is expected to remain there over the next year.",
        "- The persistent negative trends in Europe led to a cut in the ECB interest rate and to cuts in interest rates in other countries, and resulted in the markets not pricing in an increase in the interest rate in the coming year in any of the major advanced economies.",
        "According to the announcement by the Federal Reserve, the interest rate in the US is expected to remain at its almost zero level till the middle of 2013 at least, and the Fed and the ECB are continuing with their quantitative easing measures.",
        "- Home prices increased by 10.5 percent in the twelve months ending September, compared with 12.1 percent in the twelve months to August.",
        "In August– September home prices declined for the first time since December 2008.",
        "The continued increase in the number of building starts, the delayed effect of the increase in the interest rate, measures introduced by the Bank of Israel affecting mortgages, and steps taken by the Ministry of Finance in real estate taxation are all expected to continue to moderate home prices during the coming year.",
        "It should be noted that the limitation imposed by the Bank of Israel on some housing loans at variable interest rate reduces the effect of a cut in the interest rate on the average rate of interest on mortgages.",
        "The reduction in the interest rate together with the recent weakening of the effective exchange rate of the shekel are expected to help Israel's economy deal with the difficulties confronting it.",
        "The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli economy and the global economy and in financial markets.",
        "The Bank will use the tools available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, including keeping a close watch on developments in assets markets, including the housing market.",
        "The deepening debt crisis is spreading in the direction of important European countries and it appears that the measures being taken so far by European governments are far from sufficient to prevent this from happening.",
        "The beginning of the month was characterized by a certain amount of optimism following the agreements reached regarding Greece’s debt.",
        "These included a 50-percent haircut on the debt to the banking sector, a significant increase in the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) to one trillion euro and a demand that the banks increase their capital reserves.",
        "However, following the declaration by Greek Prime Minister confidence in the program was undermined and optimism was replaced with fear.",
        "At the G20 meeting, the donor countries, led by China, would not commit themselves to participation in the fund and requested clarifications regarding its operation and the austerity programs.",
        "Meanwhile, Germany and France did not manage to agree between them on the powers of the fund and how it would operate.",
        "The concern in the markets is currently focused on Italy and Spain, which together account for about 28 percent of the euro bloc’s GDP.",
        "The yields on their 10-year bonds rose to about 7 percent, and in France yields and the CDS spreads also rose, though not to the same extent.",
        "These countries are continuing to borrow even at high rates, but it is clear that this cannot continue in the long run.",
        "A critical junction will be reached already at the beginning of 2012 when Italy will have to recycle about 150 billion euro of debt (out of a total of about 300 billion in the whole of 2012).",
        "Italy and Spain are considered too big to fail, but on the other hand they are almost too big to save.",
        "As time goes on, the price of rescuing them gets higher and the chances of it happening gets slimmer.",
        "Although the ECB is continuing to purchase the bonds of the countries in distress, and since August has purchased about 110 billion euro (bringing the total to close to 200 billion), the rate and volume of purchases is far from sufficient and there are increasing calls for the ECB to begin acting with more determination and on the same scale as the Bank of England, the Fed, and the Bank of Japan.",
        "On the other hand, various governments, led by Germany, Austria and the Netherlands, are opposed to the purchasing of bonds and suggest that focus be placed on austerity programs.",
        "Nonetheless, it is worth noting that even if a change in approach is adopted in the euro bloc which leads to the purchase of significant quantities of bonds of Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain (PIIGS), this may be effective only in the short run.",
        "In the medium run, the weaker countries will have to make major and painful fiscal adjustments and will need to carry out structural reforms to restore their competitiveness, while the euro bloc as a whole needs to strengthen its fiscal cohesion and improve its budget control.",
        "Overall, the macroeconomic data for the US continues to be positive, and the upward trend that began in June has gained strength.",
        "The positive results were primarily in the areas of production, consumption and employment.",
        "Thus, manufacturing output grew by 0.7 percent in October (compared with analysts' expectations of 0.4 percent), retail sales grew by 0.5 percent (expectations were 0.3 percent) and factory orders grew by improvement in the figures for first-time applications for unemployment benefits, the supply of jobs and productivity levels.",
        "In addition, the net financial position (NFP) figures were encouraging, if one includes upward revisions of the figures for previous months.",
        "Particularly important was the pleasant surprise in some of the confidence indices of consumers, investors, small businesses and contractors (as well as other data in the construction industry).",
        "The improvement in these indices, which were particularly weak in recent months, may be a sign that consumer and investor confidence in the economy is returning.",
        "In their announcement of the Leading Economic Indicators, the Conference Board also highlighted the improvement in private consumption, production, construction and employment and claimed that the economy “has managed to overcome the fluctuations in the financial markets that were the result of the debt crisis in Europe.” In addition, many investment houses have raised their growth forecast for the fourth quarter by about 0.5 percent on average, to levels exceeding 3 percent.",
        "Nonetheless, the level of most indicators remains low and the rate of recovery is far from sufficient to enable the economy to deal with the challenges it faces.",
        "A downward revision of growth figures to 2 percent for the third quarter (compared with expectations of 2.5 percent) led Fed chairperson Ben Bernanke to again stress the downside risks in his interest rate announcement, in which he also stated that the improvement in employment would be “frustratingly slow”.",
        "He also repeated his assessment that the interest rate would remain low until mid-2013 and announced the continuation of the Operation Twist program.",
        "The performance of the large emerging economies continues to be relatively strong, although they are also experiencing a noticeable slowing of growth, which is mainly evident in forward-looking indicators.",
        "Thus, the rate of growth in manufacturing production fell in each of Brazil, Russia, India and China (known as the BRIC countries) and in Brazil the index even indicated a contraction of 1.6 percent.",
        "China’s exports grew at their lowest rate in two years and its trade surplus shrank; even its retail sales were somewhat disappointing.",
        "The World Bank expects a “soft landing” for China, with growth of 9.1 percent this year and 8.4 percent next year.",
        "However the main problem for China remains the overheating of its economy, which is manifested in inflation and the fear of bubbles in real estate, credit and investment which would endanger the banks.",
        "China’s CPI fell to 5.5 percent this month (from 6.1 percent) as expected and there were small declines in housing prices; in particular the producer price index (PPI) fell more than expected, to 5 percent.",
        "All this indicates some reduction in price pressures from the prices of goods; however, the 21.7 percent average increase in wages in most districts of China and the renewed rise (beyond expectations) in the volume of loans to the private sector indicate that the risk has not disappeared.",
        "In its first review of the Chinese banking system, the IMF reported a significant improvement, but warned that there are a number of risks with nonnegligible probabilities, particularly those related to credit provided to poorly functioning local governments and projects, and that there is increased risk in China’s real estate sector.",
        "The IMF called on the government to increase its supervision of the banks and to improve its evaluation of risk, consistent with the warning by a bank regulator in China who stated that the banks are liable to incur major losses because of the construction industry.",
        "The Nomura Bank estimated the probability of a “hard landing” for the Chinese economy at about 30 percent and claimed that the main risk lies in the combination of overinvestment with a real estate bubble, an inefficient monetary policy and debt-laden government banks.",
        "In the financial markets, concerns regarding the debt crisis and a possible return to recession still predominated this month and even strengthened in intensity.",
        "For the month as a whole, stock exchanges declined by five percent in the advanced economies and by one percent in the emerging economies and the various market volatility indices changed very little.",
        "However, the behavior of the markets was not uniform throughout the period.",
        "Thus, during the first half of the period, stocks rose by up to 10 percent in the emerging economies and up to 6 percent in the advanced economies, while the VIX volatility index declined; however, since then the stock markets have mainly fallen.",
        "In particular, the stock markets in the PIIGS countries, led by Italy, have recorded sharp declines in share prices while the yields on government bonds and also CDS spreads have risen (again) to record levels.",
        "From a longer-run perspective, the stock markets in the emerging economies have fallen by about 22 percent since the beginning of the year, compared with 13 percent in the advanced economies (and a 6 percent drop in the S&P index), in spite of the fact that the emerging economies have outperformed the advanced ones.",
        "Before the Governor makes the monthly interest rate decision,[1] discussions are held at two levels––the first in a broad forum, and the second in a narrower one.",
        "In the broad-forum discussion, the relevant background economic conditions are presented, including real, monetary and financial developments in Israel’s economy, and developments in the global economy.",
        "Participants in this discussion include the Governor, the Deputy Governor, the directors of the Research and Market Operations Departments of the Bank and economists from various departments who prepare and present the material for discussion.",
        "The data, estimates and assessments in this report are those that were available at the time of the discussions.",
        "In the narrow forum, the directors of the Research and Market Operations Departments and two other participating members of management present their recommendations regarding the interest rate and, following a discussion, the Governor makes his decision.",
        "The National Accounts data relating to the fourth quarter of 2010 and the indicators published last month (between the date of the previous interest rate decision on February 21 and the current decision on March 28) show continued expansion of economic activity, with continuing shrinking of the output gap.",
        "The increase in activity was reflected in an increase in activity in most industries, in government tax rate decisions will be made by the Committee.",
        "revenues, and in the labor market.",
        "The continued increase in world trade supported the rate of growth and its entrenchment.",
        "However, the increase in commodity prices, the natural disasters in Japan, and the geopolitical events in the Middle East had a negative impact on the indices of the public mood and the purchasing managers index, which declined following several months of stability.",
        "The updated National Accounts estimates for 2010 confirm the initial positive estimates published in February.",

        "In the discussion it was noted that a rise in the inflation environment was evident— inflation in the previous twelve months was 4.2 percent, above the upper limit of the inflation target range, and the rate of price increases in the last six months in annual terms (seasonally adjusted) was even higher.",
        "Among the factors contributing to inflation were housing prices (during the last year) and food and energy prices (in the last half year), factors which are expected to continue to exert inflationary pressure in the coming year.",
        "Together with the rise in actual inflation, market expectations of inflation also increased: inflation expectations derived from the capital market (breakeven inflation) increased again over the last month, to an average of 3.7 percent.",
        "The continued rapid rise in house prices was also discussed; these increased by about One participant in the discussion expressed concern regarding financial stability if there were to be a sudden drop in house prices, in light of the significant increase in housing credit, although the probability of such a scenario being realized was low.",
        "There followed a discussion of a macro-prudential measure relating to housing credit.",

        "As it was decided not to introduce the macro-prudential measure this month, the two participants who had recommended the quarterpercentage-point increase changed their recommendation to support the halfpercentage point increase.",
        "The main considerations underlying the half-percentage point increase were the high inflation rate over the previous twelve months, inflation expectations for one year ahead and beyond, the persistent rise in house prices, and the buoyant real macroeconomic performance of the economy in the last few months, including exports.",
        "Those supporting the larger increase in the interest rate considered that such a hike would probably dampen the demand for mortgages indexed to the prime interest rate, thereby reducing the risks in this area.",
        "The arguments put forward for the smaller increase (of a quarter of a percentage point) and introducing a macro-prudential measure relating to housing credit was based on the fact that a considerable part of the inflationary pressure derived from the increase in housing credit.",
        "A step aimed specifically at dealing with that issue would enable the interest rate to be increased less steeply, particularly in light of the risks to the global recovery deriving from the natural disasters, the debt crises in some EU countries, the geopolitical events in the Middle East and North Africa, and the increases in commodity and oil prices.",
        "The effect of the increase in the interest rate on the exchange rate and hence on exports also had to be taken into account.",
        "Taking all the above points into consideration, the Governor decided to increase the interest rate for March by half a percentage point, to 3 percent.",
        "In its announcement of the decision, the Bank of Israel emphasized the following points: - The inflation rate in the last few months exceeded the forecast rates.",

        "Expectations fell primarily for the short term—for the medium periods expectations remained steady at 2.3 percent.",
        "Forecasters' inflation predictions for the next twelve CPI readings were 2.2 percent on average, slightly below last month's average forecast.",
        "The background to the decline in inflation expectations was apparently continued expectations for a slowdown in growth world wide and in Israel, and possibly also the process of lowering prices by retail chains and service providers, influenced by the social protest against the high cost of living.",
        "At the same time, forecasts of the Bank of Israel interest rate continued to fall.",
        "Based on the Telbor (Tel Aviv Inter-Bank Offered Rate) market, the Bank of Israel interest rate one year from now is expected to be 2.7 percent, down from 3 percent a month ago, and the average of forecasters' predictions is that it will be 3 percent, down from 3.15 percent a month ago.",

        "Makam yields fell by up to 25 basis points across the yield curve, as the yield for one year fell during the period from 2.98 percent to 2.8 percent— against the background of the interest rate reduction by the Bank of Israel last month, and expectations of further reductions in coming months.",
        "The Bank of Israel interest rate was 2.75 percentage points higher than the Fed rate, and 1.5 percentage points higher than the European Central Bank (ECB) rate, after the Bank of Israel reduced its interest rate for October by 0.25 percentage points.",
        "Against the background of an increase in bond yields in the US, the yield gap between Israeli government and US Treasury 10-year securities narrowed to about 250 basis points from around 290 basis points in the previous month.",
        "In the twelve months ending in September, the M1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 0.5 percent, and the M2 aggregate (M1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 13.1 percent.",

        "In the twelve months ended in July home prices increased by 12.1 percent; compared with a 12.3 percent increase in the June figure and a 12.1 percent increase in May—this follows levels of around 20 percent in 2010.",

        "However, the lack of an increase in the labor cost per unit of output, an expected decline in margins for imported products and domestically produced ones, and the moderation in real activity will act to moderate inflation.",

        "Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by the five-year CDS spread declined over the period, and narrowed to 160 basis points from last month's 218 basis points.",

        "During the discussions on the interest rate for November, all the committee members were in favor of leaving the interest rate unchanged at 3 percent.",
        "Participants in the discussion dealt with several issues.",
        "The major issues were the development of inflation and inflation expectations, economic developments world wide and the risks they pose to Israel, and an assessment of real economic activity in Israel, including with respect to the housing market.",
        "Regarding developments in inflation and inflation expectations, participants noted that the inflation environment is moderate: in the previous twelve months the CPI increased 2.9 percent, and since the beginning of the year it has increased 1.9 percent, seasonally adjusted.",
        "The CPI excluding housing increased 2.1 percent over the past 12 months, and has increased 0.9 percent in the year to date.",
        "Likewise, against the background of lowered prices and expectations of continued price cuts due to the social protest and expectations for a slowdown in economic activity, inflation expectations derived from the capital market declined, and are now only 1.6 percent, compared with 1.8 percent at the beginning of the month and 2 percent in the middle of September.",
        "Forecasters' predictions for inflation over the next 12 months average Telbor (Tel Aviv Inter-Bank Offered Rate) market is lower, 1.7 percent.",
        "Expectations for longer terms are also around the center of the inflation target range, at about 2.3 percent.",
        "It was also noted that according to the Bank of Israel Research Department's basic scenario the inflation rate over the next twelve months is expected to be around the middle of the target range, and the average interest rate is expected to remain at its current level of 3 percent.",
        "An alternative scenario—which assumes global growth 1 percentage point lower than the basic scenario, together with a lower path of energy prices—would be reflected in a slowdown in domestic demand.",
        "As a result, it is expected that under this scenario the rate of inflation over the next twelve months would be closer to the lower limit of the target range—about 1.5 percent, and that the Bank of Israel interest rate would be lowered over the next year to 2 percent.",
        "A major issue in the discussion was the level of activity of the global economy, and the risks posed by it to the Israeli economy, specifically those connected with the debt crisis in Europe, and the potential impact on its operation.",
        "Members of the committee expressed concern about the lengthy process of formulating and approving an aid program, and the resulting uncertainty, and about the continued negative sentiment in the global markets, and hence also in the domestic markets, over recent periods.",
        "It was emphasized that over recent months there was increased concern over a global slowdown, specifically over the eurozone sliding toward a recession, a slowdown in US growth, and a decline in growth rates in emerging markets (primarily China).",
        "The participants referred to the new growth forecast by the IMF for 2012, which was revised down relative to the June forecast, and it is currently 4 percent for the global economy (compared with 4.5 percent previously), and 1.6 percent for advanced economies (compared with 2.3 percent previously).",
        "Emerging economies are expected to grow 6.1 percent in 2012.",
        "Several participants noted that despite the negative sentiment, some recent indicators were better than expected: indicators of US activity were positive surprises, and there are indications of higher than currently expected growth.",
        "In addition, industrial production and export figures of core economies in Europe were strong, in contrast to forecasts.",
        "With regard to the effect on Israel's economy, participants reiterated that the risk of the debt crisis spreading to the banking sector, pessimism regarding growth, and a slowdown in world trade are liable to impact local economic activity, especially the exporting segment.",
        "In this regard, the renewed trend of appreciation of the shekel was noted.",
        "Committee members also discussed the level of economic activity in the economy.",
        "Most agreed that the majority of indicators that became available this month support the assessment of recent months that the pace of growth of the economy is more moderate than that of 2010 and the first quarter of 2011.",
        "Most of the slowdown in expansion is a result of the moderation of global demand growth, which impacts exports, but indicators of private consumption have also moderated.",
        "It was also noted that most indicators which forecast the economy's future activities, including consumer confidence indices and the Purchasing Managers Index, as well as those derived from the Bank of Israel Companies Survey and the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of business trends, point to stability and even a slowdown in economic activity.",
        "Home prices were also discussed.",
        "No significant slowdown was seen, despite a sharp decline in the volume of transactions.",
        "Home prices increased at a monthly rate of 0.8 percent in July–August, and by 12.1 percent over the past 12 months, a slight moderation compared with the previous month.",
        "With that, the continued growth in supply, the lagged effect of the increase in the interest rate, measures introduced by the Bank of Israel affecting mortgages, and steps taken by the Ministry of Finance in real estate taxation, are all expected to continue to help moderate home prices over the course of the next year.",
        "In light of the range of factors, the Monetary Committee decided to leave the interest for the month of November unchanged at 3 percent.",
        "In light of the level of uncertainty regarding global activity, specifically activity in Europe, and the moderation which is becoming evident in Israel's economic activity, the committee members emphasized that against the background of the lowering of the interest rate last month, keeping the interest rate at its current level leaves the Bank of Israel room to respond to economic developments in Israel and world wide.",
        "In announcing the decision, the Bank of Israel emphasized the following points that led to the decision to leave the interest rate unchanged for November 2011: - Inflation expectations for the coming 12 months, both those calculated from the capital market and those of forecasters, continued to decline within the inflation target range and are currently 1.7 percent and 2.2 percent, respectively.",
        "The rate of inflation over the previous 12 months entered the target range in September, for the first time since December 2010, and is currently 2.9 percent.",
        "The rate of inflation, seasonally adjusted, over the past seven months has been around the lower limit of the inflation target range.",
        "- Economic indicators that became available this month indicated that local economic activity continued to expand, but at a slower pace than in 2010 and the first quarter of 2011.",
        "The slowdown in the growth of the local economy was primarily a result of moderation in global demand and its impact on exports, but some weakness also began to be evident in domestic demand.",
        "- Concerns of a negative turnaround in the eurozone remain, primarily in light of the difficulties in formulating a rescue plan for countries suffering debt crises.",
        "In the US, while concerns of a negative turnaround have not dissipated, recent figures on activity were better than expected.",
        "With that, the level of uncertainty regarding developments in the global economy remains especially high, and clearly impacts on uncertainty regarding developments in Israel's economy.",
        "- The negative turnaround in Europe and the slow growth in the US have led to the markets not pricing in an interest rate increase over the coming year by the central bank of any large advanced economy.",
        "The Federal Reserve has said that the fed funds rate is expected to remain at its near zero level until at least the middle of - The rate of increase in home prices over the twelve months which ended in August remains relatively stable at a high level of over 12 percent, though low compared with the 20 percent levels of the previous 12 months.",
        "With that, the sustained increase in building starts, the lagged effect of the increase in the interest rate, measures taken by the Bank of Israel with regard to mortgages, and changes in real estate taxation introduced by the Ministry of Finance, are expected to continue to contribute to moderation in home prices over the coming year.",
        "The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli economy and the global economy and in financial markets.",
        "The Bank will use the tools available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, including keeping a close watch on developments in assets markets, including the housing market.",
        "Committee Risk factors continue to be concentrated in Europe.",
        "The fear that the crisis will spread to the banking sector was realized this month with the nationalization of Dexia by Belgium and France.",
        "On the positive side, the rapid response of the Belgian and French governments to the event is perhaps an indicator that governments will not allow a collapse similar to that of Lehman Brothers to occur in Europe.",
        "However, the lowered ratings of large banks (such as RBS, UBS, BNP and others)—some of whom received junk ratings—by Moody’s and Fitch, brought into focus the high level of risk existing in the system.",
        "Amid fears of a severe financial crisis, liquidity difficulties in the banking system and the lowering of bank ratings, EU leaders announced plans for a comprehensive plan to stabilize the debt crisis and the banking sector.",
        "It is expected that the plan will be announced at the meeting of G20 leaders at the beginning of November.",
        "These declarations succeeded in buying some time by significantly reducing the pressure in the capital markets, which reacted with sharp price increases.",
        "In the meantime, the transfer of the sixth aid installment to Greece (about €8 billion) was delayed until November, since the Greeks have not fulfilled the conditions attached to it (already this year, the deficit/GDP targets have been revised a number of times and as of now Greece has not met the conditions for 2012 either).",
        "Meanwhile, the discussions to approve the changes in the EFSF fund (used for the purchase of government bonds and loans to the financial sector) and the participation of the private sector (PSI) were concluded successfully.",
        "The approval of the changes in the EFSF fund is aimed at achieving three main objectives: the approval of a second assistance plan for Greece in the amount of about €110 billion, an increase in the banks’ capital and finally an orderly default by Greece, which is expected no later than early 2012 and which will include, according to reports, a \"haircut\" of about 50 percent.",
        "An additional goal is the isolation of Italy and Spain from the rest of the economies, which has become all the more important after Spain’s rating was lowered by two levels to A (the lowest rating in Europe currently).",
        "On the macro side, most indicators point to a recession during the third quarter and its intensification during the fourth quarter, and growth is expected to be negative in One of the more worrying indicators this month is the PMI, which indicates, for the first time since July 2009, a contraction in business activity (a level of less than 50 indicates a contraction during the subsequent two quarters).",
        "Other indicators, including confidence indices, retail sales and inventory have also been disappointing.",
        "There is major concern regarding the ZEW and IFO indicators in Germany which point to an economic contraction in coming quarters.",
        "On the other hand, indicators for August of manufacturing production in France and Italy as well as German exports were stronger than expected and indicate that the recession may be relatively short.",
        "In contrast to Europe, the economic indicators in the US have been surprisingly positive.",
        "Macroeconomic indicators continue to improve from their low levels during the summer.",
        "The main implication of this trend is that the risk of a second recession in the US, especially in coming months, has shrunk significantly.",
        "Nonetheless, this is not sufficient to change the growth trend, which is expected to be moderate.",
        "The improvement in economic activity has been manifested in all sectors—particularly in the auto industry, which is recovering from the earthquake in Japan.",
        "Car sales jumped to more than 13 million this month (the historical average is around 16 million).",
        "Improvement was also seen in the business sector, where investment grew, and in consumer spending, as reflected in retail sales, which rose by 1.1 percent in September.",
        "The PMI data for the production and service sector was surprisingly positive and strengthened the assessment that the US recovery will continue.",
        "In addition, the GDP figure for the second quarter was revised upward by 0.1 percent, to There was an also improvement in employment (in contrast to the previous month).",
        "Non-farm payroll numbers stood at about 137,000, but the situation of the labor market is still problematic.",
        "Thus, the broad unemployment rate (U-6) rose to 16.5 percent while the number of individuals seeking a job for longer than 27 weeks continued to rise.",
        "According to the present rate of hiring, it will take about 5 years just to return to the rate of employment that prevailed prior to the Lehman crisis.",
        "[1] The real estate market, which is one of the main components of household wealth, continues to languish.",
        "Although there are initial signs of a recovery in housing prices from their very low levels, this is not sufficient to change the overall negative picture, primarily in view of the fact that about 23 percent of homes (about 11 million) have negative mortgage values (\"underwater\" mortgages).",
        "The fiscal situation in the US continues to be problematic.",
        "A real debt crisis in the US is still far off; however, the large deficit again this year ($1.3 trillion) makes it difficult to expand assistance programs and requires large-scale cuts in the medium term.",
        "However, it is expected (based on statements by Bernanke) that the Fed will try to avoid another recession in the US through the use of every means at its disposal.",
        "Thus, in view of the weakness in the economy and the risk of a recession in 2012, there is a not insignificant probability of a QE-3 program in the US in 2012.",
        "Despite the positive surprises in the US, it is likely that the trend is only temporary.",
        "Some of the forecasts (according to the Bloomberg survey and the US yield curve) expect a recession in 2012 with a likelihood of over 60 percent.",
        "In addition, the failure to approve the Administration’s new assistance plan in the amount of $450 billion, which includes tax benefits for problematic sectors, is liable to reduce GDP by up to about 2 percent, particularly since the previous programs are coming to an end.",
        "In addition, there is the debt crisis in Europe which is liable to endanger financial stability in the US through financial transmission mechanisms and reduce household wealth (since the beginning of the current crisis, $1.5 trillion has been lost in the value work.",

        "At the same time, there have been noticeable initial signs of a slowdown in recent months.",
        "It should be mentioned that the contractionary measures taken in some economies (raising of the interest rate and regulatory measures), which were meant to prevent overheating, together with signs of a slowdown in the developed economies, the high level of volatility in the financial markets and the outflow of capital, have increased fears of a more significant slowdown in growth in these markets.",
        "Some countries have already changed the direction of their monetary policy and have begun to respond by lowering their interest rates.",
        "However, their ability to respond more aggressively through interest rate policy is limited, in view of the relatively high inflation rates and the significant appreciation of their currencies.",
        "The appreciation in currencies has led a number of countries (particularly Russia) to sell dollars in order to offset the effect of exiting investors on their exchange rate.",

        "Growth in manufacturing production, investment in assets and retail sales also surprised on the upside.",
        "On the other hand, there are signs of a slowdown in the rate of China’s growth (the growth rate was expected to be about 9.3 percent).",
        "This slowdown had been expected and is partly the intended result of government contractionary measures in recent months.",
        "There is concern that the global slowdown will reinforce this trend.",
        "It should be mentioned that the government may reverse its contractionary policy and adopt various expansionary programs to support economic activity.",

        "There are assessments in the markets that this move will in fact increase the probability of a double dip as a result of its effect on exports from China.",
        "Despite the crisis atmosphere in the markets, an announcement by German Chancellor Merkel and French President Sarkozy regarding the assistance package changed the negative sentiments in the markets and resulted in a significant rise in various share indexes.",
        "This trend leveled off at a later stage due to renewed doubts regarding the effectiveness of the plan and the possible lowering of ratings of some of the major European economies.",
        "For the month as a whole, share indices increased significantly, at rates exceeding 5 percent (the DAX rose by about 13 percent), and there were declines in the various risk indices (such as the VIX and EMBI).",
        "This trend is expected to intensify in the near future due to the following factors: month.",
        "In recent months, forecasted profits have been revised downward from However, in the meantime, most of the financial statements have been surprisingly positive and it is expected that the reports for this quarter will continue to positively affect markets in the coming month.",
        "As noted, there was a significant dampening of the risk-off atmosphere (risk aversion), which was also reflected in the decline of the VIX index to 31 points from about 41 points last month.",
        "A positive trend was also recorded in the emerging markets despite the continuing outflow of “hot money”.",
        "The volatility in the markets is expected to remain high as a result of the multiple risk loci and the high level of liquidity.",
        "The high level of volatility in the bond markets continued this month.",
        "The expected assistance package managed to reverse the upward trend in yields in problematic countries in the short run; however, as a result of uncertainty surrounding the assistance package, the lowered ratings of Italy and Spain and fears that France’s rating would also be lowered, yields again rose to levels of 5.9 percent and 5.4 percent in Italy and Spain, respectively, thus forcing the ECB to intervene in the markets.",
        "As part of the risk-on atmosphere, yield curves in the US and Germany reacted with a sharp increase in yields of 20-30 basis points, with part of the increase—at least in the US—due to the strong macro results in the US.",
        "An additional indication of the crisis in the markets comes from the new issues market, in which activity has contracted significantly in recent months.",
        "This is due to the intensifying debt crisis and the resulting jump in the cost of issuing.",
        "Total issues of investment grade corporate bonds in the US and Europe stood at about $22 billion and $33 billion, respectively, in contrast to hundreds of billions of dollars in previous quarters, and activity in the junk bond market came to a complete halt.",
        "This, together with the increasingly difficult terms for obtaining bank credit in the third quarter, is liable to adversely affect the activity of corporations and particularly SMEs, which constitute the foundation of the major Western economies.",

        "In the narrow forum, the directors of the Research and Market Operations Departments and two other participating members of management (the Deputy Governor and the Head of the Monetary and Finance Division of the Research Department) present their recommendations regarding the interest rate and, following a discussion, the Governor makes his decision.",
        "Most economic indicators published between the previous interest rate decision on May 23 and the current discussion on June 27 support the assessment that economic activity is continuing to expand in the second quarter too, albeit at a slower rate than in the first quarter.",

        "Manufactured goods exports excluding diamonds fell by 4 percent in May, due mainly to a drop in exports of the electronics industries.",
        "The decline in exports can be attributed to the lower levels of world trade in April (a nominal drop of 2.3 percent and a real drop of 3.8 percent in the triple trade index––the trade of Germany, Japan and the US) from the March level, and to the continued real appreciation of the shekel and its lagged effect.",
        "Goods imports increased again, by a rapid 7 percent in May, the rise incorporating all components.",
        "The increase in imports is based on Israel’s continued economic growth and the increase in domestic demand.",

        "At the end of the current discussions on the interest rate for June, one of them recommended that the Governor increase the interest rate by interest rate unchanged for July.",
        "As stated in previous reports of interest rate decisions, the Bank of Israel is implementing a policy consistent with the process of gradually restoring a more normal interest rate environment—a process aimed at stabilizing inflation within the target range, and supporting further growth of economic activity while maintaining financial stability.",
        "The pace of interest rate increases is not fixed, but depends on the inflation environment, growth in Israel and globally, the monetary policies of the major central banks, and the exchange rates of the shekel.",
        "Leaving the rate of interest for July unchanged at 3.25 percent is consistent with that process, and at that level, monetary policy continues to be expansionary.",
        "Several issues were discussed, the main topics being an assessment of the environment of real economic activity, including reference to developments around the world and geopolitical risks; the inflation path and inflation expectations; policy measures introduced in the last few months relating to housing and their effect on housing prices, against the background of the persistent rapid increase in housing prices; and whether was a need for the introduction of another macro-prudential measure in the housing field.",
        "In assessing the environment of real economic activity, the participants noted that the slowdown in the rate of global growth and the implications of the debt crisis in Europe raise the level of concern over a deterioration in the real economic situation around the world and the postponement or slowdown in the rate of increases in interest rates in the major economies to normal levels.",
        "Hence, it was necessary to deal with pressures for the appreciation of the shekel that are likely to increase due to the expected interest rate differentials.",
        "The effect of the slowdown around the world reflected in data showing a decline in Israel's exports in April–May compared with the first quarter increase the possibility that GDP growth will be slower in the second quarter than its rapid rate in the first.",
        "In this context it was noted that the global slowdown was likely to cause a slowdown in the rate of economic growth in Israel, which would moderate the rate of inflation.",
        "The point was also made that despite increased inflation around the world, global inflation expectations have declined growth forecasts, and reduced monetary expansion in several countries), which is expected to lower the rate of inflation in Israel too.",
        "Discussing the development of inflation and inflation expectations, participants stated that inflation over the previous twelve months, at 4.1 percent, was higher than the upper limit of the target inflation range (also after the publication of the May CPI).",
        "With regard to the fact that the rate of price increases in the last three months participants in the discussion considered this an indication that there had been a move to a lower inflation environment, and others felt that it was premature to reach that conclusion with confidence.",
        "All agreed, however, that inflation expectations had shown improvement, with a decline in expectations to all horizons, with twelve-month forward expectations, both those derived from the capital market and the average of those of forecasters, coming down slightly to below the upper limit of the target inflation range.",
        "It was stressed, however, that the inflation expectations environment was still higher than desired.",
        "It was further noted that the gap between the current Bank of Israel interest rate and the level considered “normal” granted the Bank degrees of freedom in determining the pace of increases in the rate, so that the pace of interest rate hikes could be increased should the need arise even without increasing the interest rate for July.",
        "Another central issue discussed was the effect of the policy measures relating to housing introduced so far by the Bank of Israel and the Ministry of Finance, in light of the renewed increase in house prices viewed over the twelve months to end-May.",
        "All participants in the discussion agreed that it was too soon to consider the available data as reflecting the effect of the various policy measures introduced.",
        "The effect will be reflected in the data of the next few months, at the earliest, and is expected to continue during the next two years; more time is needed before the extent of the policy measures’ effect on house prices can be assessed.",
        "Moreover, the effect of the interest rate on the share of houses for investment purposes is very slow, and is just starting.",
        "On this point the member of management who recommended increasing the interest rate this month added that in his opinion the house price problem requires action to be taken this month, either via the interest rate or via other policy measures.",
        "This led to a discussion of the need for another macro-prudential measure in housing despite the cumulative increases in the Bank of Israel interest rate and the measures introduced recently, the effect of which, as stated, is expected to be reflected in the future.",
        "This, against the background of the risks incurred by constructors who took credit to buy land at high prices in light of the possibility of a drop in asset prices in the future.",
        "Against this are aligned the risks of buyers who may have difficulty repaying their mortgages.",
        "On this point participants expressed concern that the introduction of too many policy measures in addition to increases in the interest rate could result in a sharp drop of house prices instead of a gradual decline.",
        "Taking into consideration the slowdown in the global economy and its expected negative effect on Israel's economy already in the second quarter, the differential between the interest rate in Israel and those in the major economies, and the moderation of actual and expected inflation, three members of management recommended that the Governor leave the rate of interest unchanged for July.",
        "Their intention was to leave more time to assess the effect of the increases in the interest rate so far, and the effect on housing prices and housing credit of the policy measures already introduced in the housing area.",
        "A no-change decision would be consistent with a gradual return to a normal interest rate environment in light of the increases in the last few months, and would be consistent with the efforts to return inflation gradually to within the target range, taking into account the other considerations mentioned above.",
        "The member of management who recommended a 25 basis point increase in the interest rate considered it important to adopt a firmer policy with regard to housing prices, as long as there is no clear evidence that the steps taken so far are having a significant effect.",
        "This, in light of the high price the economy would have to pay if the assessment that housing prices would moderate due to the measures taken proved to be incorrect.",
        "Taking all the above points into consideration, the Governor decided to leave the interest rate for July unchanged at 3.25 percent.",
        "In its announcement of the decision, the Bank of Israel emphasized the following points: - Inflation over the previous twelve months continues to be high, at 4.1 percent.",
        "However, inflation expectations for the next twelve months derived from the capital market and the average of the forecasters’ expectations declined over the past month, and are now slightly below the upper limit of the range.",
        "The past three CPI readings have been consistent with achieving the target inflation range.",
        "- Economic indicators published this month point to continued expansion of economic activity and expectations are that the expansion will continue in the second quarter, even if at a more moderate pace.",
        "With that, there is growing concern over slower US economic growth and the worsening risks of debt problems in Europe and their implications for Israel's economy.",
        "- The annual rate of increase in house prices continues to be high––in the last twelve months house prices increased by 15.3 percent.",
        "With that, the effect of interest rate increases, steps by the Bank of Israel in the mortgage market, and steps by the Ministry of Finance regarding real estate taxation, together with the continued growth in building starts, are expected to slow the rate of increase of housing prices over the course of the coming year.",
        "- Central bank interest rates in the major advanced economies are still low, and are expected to remain so in the next few months.",
        "Against the background of the acceleration in inflation in fast growing economies, several central banks increased their interest rates again this month.",
        "However, the concern of a slowdown in US growth and the worsening of debt risks in Europe led to expectations of a slowdown in the pace of interest rate increases in other markets.",
        "In the first half of the year the Bank of Israel raised the interest rate markedly.",
        "At the same time, steps were taken by the Bank of Israel and the Ministry of Finance in the housing market.",
        "In addition, the shekel appreciated over recent months and there was a decline in commodity prices.",
        "The impact on inflation of these items is expected to be felt in the future.",
        "In light of these factors, and the marked increase of risks in the global economy, it was decided to leave the interest rate at its current level at this time.",
        "The Bank of Israel stated that it will continue to monitor developments in Israel's economy and the global economy and in the financial markets.",
        "The Bank will use the instruments available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, including keeping a close watch on developments in the assets market, and especially in the housing market.",
        "Director of the Research Department Finance Division, Research Department Most macroeconomic data published during the month continued to indicate a slowdown in the rate of recovery of the global economy.",
        "The weakness derived mainly from the US and European economies (excluding Germany) and some East Asian economies.",
        "This led to a downward revision of the growth forecasts by the investment houses.",
        "[2] Some of the reasons for the current slowdown are temporary, such as the jump in commodity prices, chiefly in oil prices, in the first five months of the year, which impacted mainly on households.",
        "Another reason was the _tsunami in_ Japan (and other natural disasters) which had a stronger effect on the global supply chain than was originally assessed.",
        "The Japanese economy contracted by 1.3 percent in the first quarter (quarterly change), and till now has not shown signs that it is recovering from the effects of the earthquake.",
        "The effects of the _tsunami are most_ evident in the worldwide motor industry which was forced to cut activity and manpower.",
        "The huge increase in stocks in 2010 resulting from over-optimistic forecast regarding the rate of recovery in the global economy in 2011 also affected production and growth.",
        "It should be noted, however, that although most of the data came as an unpleasant surprise, they still indicate positive growth, some of which is sustainable.",
        "This is the picture that emerges from the OECD, IMF and World Bank reviews, which emphasized the temporary nature of the latest weakness,[3] and the improvement in the recovery path in the global economy in the last year.",
        "Thus, in the past year the global economy has been showing an expansionary trend based mainly on private consumption and world trade, with the central expected scenario still one of gentle acceleration in the second half of the year.",
        "Most indicators published this month again came as an unpleasant surprise, as for the first time since the beginning of the year and in contrast to the trend in the last few months data on employment were also significantly lower than the forecasts.",
        "This, together with other weak data led the Chairman of the Fed to talk of frustratingly slow job growth and weakness in the some US industries, effectively leaving the door open for a QE3 program.",
        "[4] The US labor market is still showing a deficit of some 11 million jobs (since the recovery started the US job market has created about 1.7 million posts out of some 8.7 year.",
        "mentioned last month is an indication of the deterioration of the general worldwide situation.",
        "million that were lost during the crisis).",
        "[5] In addition, the real estate market in the US, which lost about 60 percent of its value since the outbreak of the crisis in 2008, falling from a level of $15 trillion to just a little above $6 trillion, started weakening again recently.",
        "An urgent problem as yet unsolved is the debt ceiling, as it is estimated that the amount of cash in the hands of the administration is likely to run out at the beginning of August this year.",
        "The administration’s inability to reach agreement with the House of Representatives constitutes a serious threat to the credit rating of the US, and this issue was afforded increased attention this month by the rating agencies and also by China, which is the largest holder of US bonds outside the US, and which used the phrase “playing with fire” to describe the situation (the IMF concurred with this warning).",
        "The administration has not yet presented a program of cutbacks to bring the worrying path of US debt back to a reasonable level.",
        "The current gross debt is close to 100 percent of GDP, and it is expected to increase even further in the coming years the year will exceed 100 percent, three years earlier than predicted in the previous forecast).",
        "The lack of agreement between Germany and the ECB (European Central Bank) on the shares of private creditors in the Greece rescue program, combined with the political problems in Greece against the background of the adjustment measure required increased concern over a serious bank credit crisis.",
        "Reports of banks’ difficulties in raising capital in the market and the lowering of the rating of French banks by Moody’s (which also warned Italy about a possible reduction of its rating) increased the pressure in the government bond market, and pushed the yield on Greek bonds with a two-year horizon to around 30 percent (yields on Irish and Portuguese bonds also reached new record levels).",
        "The pressure eased somewhat after Germany came into line with the ECB position on private investors’ participation in the rescue program, and after the failure of the no-confidence vote in the Greek parliament.",
        "Nonetheless, the assessment in the market is that the current rescue plan will apparently not avoid the need for a future restructuring of Greece’s debt, and possibly even those of other economies (Moody’s assess the probability of a debt restructuring in Greece at about 70 percent).",

        "Most leading share indices reacted to the weak macroeconomic data, the deterioration in the European debt crisis in Europe and the ending of the QE2 program with marked falls of between 3 percent and 7 percent.",
        "[6] Nor did the continued improvement in companies’ profits and relatively low multiples (mainly in the European banking sector) succeed in overcoming the generally negative sentiment.",
        "The reduced risk appetite was also reflected in the gradual rise in the market volatility index (VIX) and the widening of the various margins around the world (emerging market bonds, EMBI, and corporate bonds indices).",
        "As stated the QE2 program ended this month.",
        "The ending of the process, instead of leading to increased yields, had the opposite effect and yields in the advanced economies continued to decline.",
        "In the US the yield on 10-year notes dropped for the first time since the end of 2010, to about 3 percent.",
        "This decline expresses the concern that the ending of the program will result in a more severe slowdown.",
        "The ending of the program of Treasuries purchases removed a key player (almost the sole player) from the US government bond market––during the period of the program the Fed bought about 85 percent of the US government bond issues.",
        "In Europe, yields in the PIG economies (Portugal, Ireland and Greece) leaped to new record levels; 2-year Greek bonds reached close to 30 percent, while yields on similar bonds in Ireland and Portugal continued upwards, with both approaching 12.5 percent.",
        "The new issues market (bonds and shares), however, continues to flourish for all ratings.",

        "The macro-economic picture developing until now is that of an economy where the use of resources – domestic and from overseas – is growing rapidly.",
        "With that, the level of GDP in the first quarter of 2011, according to the estimate of the Research Department, indicates that the output gap has nearly closed.",
        "Labor market figures show that despite the economy's nearing full employment, wage pressures are not yet seen in the business sector.",
        "An analysis of sector salary figures shows that in most sectors, the nominal wage is rising at a moderate pace.",
        "The preliminary estimate of national accounts figures for the first quarter of 2011 points to continued fast growth in economic activity: GDP grew 4.7 percent, private consumption excluding consumer durables rose 3.7 percent, investment in fixed assets increased 23.7 percent, exports grew 16 percent, and imports grew 15.9 percent.",

        "Compared with the situation a month ago, there was a marked slowdown in searches for durable goods, personal care, restaurants and tourism.",
        "In addition, despite the fact that the Purchasing Managers Index in industry rose in April, and the fact that most components of the index – including manufacturing capacity, export demand, and employment – are in an expansionary trend, the index is still below the level of 50 points, and so it points to contraction in activities.",
        "Labor market data point to continued expansion in employment, and a drop in unemployment, with a moderate increase in wages.",

        "In the previous twelve months it rose by 4 percent, above the upper limit of the target range.",
        "The April increase in the CPI was influenced, similarly to recent months, by increases in the price of food and energy, and from a continued rise in housing prices (representing rental contracts), and also by the seasonal increase in the prices of clothing and footwear.",
        "Price drops were seen only in furniture and equipment.",

        "The interest rate is expected to increase gradually to about 4.2 percent in a year’s time The main factors causing the higher inflation rate were the same as before: the housing component (rentals), which is expected to continue rising rapidly, increased demand, and the increase in energy and commodity prices.",
        "The main force acting to reduce inflation is the appreciation reflected in the effective exchange rate, and the lagged effects of recent interest rate increases.",
        "The main factors which could change the forecasts for real activity and inflation in Israel are developments in the global economy, including changes in commodity and oil prices, developments in the local housing market, the realization of geopolitical risks, and a possible increase in wage pressures in the public sector.",

        "Be that as it may, the reductions in commodity prices to date are expected to moderate the rising rate of inflation in emerging market economies.",
        "Against this background, the investment houses assess that no increase in the interest rate in the eurozone is expected before July, and as far as the US is concerned, the expected timing of increases in the interest rate was pushed back further.",

        "As stated in previous reports of interest rate decisions, the Bank of Israel is implementing a policy consistent with the process of gradually restoring a more normal interest rate environment—a process aimed at stabilizing inflation within the target range, and supporting further growth of economic activity while maintaining financial stability.",
        "The pace of interest rate increases is not fixed, but depends on the inflation environment, growth in Israel and globally, the monetary policies of the major central banks, and the exchange rates of the shekel.",
        "An increase of 25 basis points in the rate of interest for June is consistent with that process, and at that level, monetary policy continues to be expansionary.",
        "Several issues were discussed, including the expected path of inflation and inflation expectations, an assessment of the environment of real economic activity including reference to developments around the world, and geopolitical risks.",
        "The first issues discussed were inflation and inflation expectations.",
        "It was noted that the inflation environment is still above the upper limit of the target inflation range, the midpoint of which is 2 percent inflation a year.",
        "Inflation over the last twelve months was 4 percent, and although inflation, seasonally adjusted, was low in the last two months, it is too soon to conclude that this represents a turning point.",
        "Participants also noted that 12-month forward inflation expectations, both those derived from the capital market and those of forecasters, are still above the upper limit of the inflation target.",
        "This, despite the fact that various forces are acting to moderate inflation––the recent appreciation of the shekel, and the reduction in world commodity prices, essentially food and crude oil.",
        "The point was also made that according to the Research Department forecast, inflation is expected to decline to within the target range in the next twelve months, assuming that the interest rate rises gradually to 4.2 percent.",
        "The lower than forecast rate of inflation in the last two months, does not provide a strong enough reason to deviate from the upward-sloping path of the interest rate.",
        "The level of real economic activity was also discussed.",
        "The participants agreed that most indicators published this month supported the assessment that in the first quarter of 2011 and in April the rapid increase in real activity, demand and employment continued.",
        "The National Accounts data for the first quarter show more rapid growth than that in the previous Research Department forecast, and the updated data and the figures for the last twelve months highlight the increases in business sector product and in the domestic use of resources.",
        "Employment data also indicate expansion, although wage increases have been moderate.",
        "Participants in the discussion were of the view that the macroeconomic situation is that of an economy with buoyant demand, falling unemployment, an output gap that is closing, and close-to-full employment.",
        "Other issues discussed were the level of activity in the global economy and the risks– confronting the Israeli economy, and their potential economic impact.",
        "Participants also expressed concern over a slowdown in US economic activity and over its ability to handle the growing fiscal burden, and spoke of indications of a slowdown in emerging market economies, including in China.",
        "Most of the participants thought that although the level of uncertainty regarding the pace of the global recovery had risen, it was not expected to have a significant impact on domestic activity in the short term.",
        "The probability of the realization of the current geopolitical risks is unknown.",
        "Taking into account the high rate of growth and the approach to full employment, three members recommended increasing the interest rate in order to reduce the inflation rate.",
        "The member who recommended no change in the interest rate quoted the level of uncertainty regarding the continued recovery of global economic activity and the increased geopolitical risks as the main arguments supporting that recommendation.",
        "The recommendation to increase the interest rate took into consideration the fact that central bank interest rates in the advanced economies are at a low level and are not expected to increase in the near future.",
        "It was mentioned that the increasing differential between interest rates in those economies and that in Israel makes it necessary to strike a balance between the domestic factors serving to favor an increase in the rate and the effect of such an increase on shekel appreciation and hence on exports and on total economic activity.",
        "In light of the latest indicators of economic activity and the shekel depreciation since the last monetary policy discussions, the members recommending an increase in the interest rate did not expect that it would significantly disturb the balance between the above forces.",
        "In addition, it was stated in the discussion that despite the moderation in the pace of increase in house prices in the last few months, it remains high.",
        "In the last twelve months house prices rose by 13.9 percent.",
        "Taking all the above points into consideration, the Governor decided to increase the interest rate for June by 25 basis points, to 3.25 percent.",
        "In its announcement of the decision, the Bank of Israel emphasized the following points: - The inflation environment is still above the upper limit of the target inflation range.",
        "Inflation over the previous twelve months was 4 percent.",
        "Inflation expectations for the next twelve months derived from the capital market and the average of the forecasters’ expectations are still slightly above the upper limit of the range this month.",
        "This, despite several background developments that could be expected to moderate inflation, such as the appreciation of the shekel in recent months and the fall in commodity prices.",
        "- Most economic indicators published this month support the assessment that the rapid expansion of activity continued in the first quarter of 2011 and in April, specifically on the export side, but also in domestic demand and employment.",
        "National Accounts data for the first quarter are consistent with a growth rate higher than that in the most recent Research Department forecast (4.5 percent GDP growth in 2011).",
        "Employment data indicate continued expansion, with the economy approaching full employment.",
        "Nevertheless, there are several risks that imply a relatively high level of uncertainty regarding future global growth and its implications for Israel's economy.",
        "- The annual rate of increase in house prices continues to be high, although it has slowed a little––in the last twelve months house prices increased by 13.9 percent.",
        "- Central bank interest rates in the major advanced economies are still low, and are expected to remain so in the next few months.",
        "Against the background of the acceleration in inflation in emerging market economies, several central banks increased their interest rates again this month.",
        "The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in Israel's economy and the global economy and in the financial markets.",
        "The Bank will use the instruments available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, including keeping a close watch on developments in the assets market, and especially in the housing market.",
        "Finance Division, Research Department Despite a rise in morale among the American public and a strengthening of its support for the administration, following the killing of Al Qaeda's leader, there was a 10% drop in the investor optimism index with regard to the recovery of the US economy, compared with January.",
        "Macroeconomic figures continued to be mixed, and while they pointed to a lower than expected growth rate and a continued drop in home prices in the first quarter, they also showed a higher than expected number of jobs added.",
        "During the period that preceded the current interest rate decision, the US Federal Reserve updated its 2011 growth forecast from a range of 3.43-3.9 percent that had been published in January, to a range of only 3.1-3.3 percent, against the background of weak growth figures for the first quarter, as well as its forecast of the unemployment rate from 8.9 percent to 8.5 percent, while noting that it expects slow development of any sort of lowering of the unemployment rate.",
        "As far as its quantitative easing plan - QE2 – US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said that it will be completed as planned at the end of June, though with that, the Fed will continue to replace all bonds reaching maturity with new bonds, so that in effect the quantitative easing, at this stage, is not expected to influence the markets, in his assessment.",
        "It appears that the quantitative easing plan at most moderated the slowdown in growth but did not lead to its strengthening, and in addition it brought about an increase in the level of inflation which eroded the nominal gains.",
        "For example, despite a rise of 1.6% in labor productivity in the first quarter, there was a in private consumption reflects higher prices and not a real increase in demand.",
        "Aside from macro economic figures, it appears that the central problem of the US, as Federal Reserve Bank Chairman Bernanke expressed it, is the growing deficit.",
        "The International Monetary Fund noted in its Fiscal Monitor quarterly report that Japan developed economies which are increasing their fiscal deficit.",
        "It should be pointed out that since the crisis broke out, the US chose quantitative and fiscal easing in order to support growth, at a cost of a rise in the level of deficit and debt to GDP.",
        "It appears that with the large number of voices calling for fiscal and even monetary constriction, both from within (Walker, Volcker, Geithner) and from without, at the end of the day there will have to be constraints, but this time at a cost of slowdown in growth and a rise in the unemployment rate, as is happening in Greece and Portugal.",
        "For example, the fall in growth in the last quarter was very much impacted by the drop in public consumption, and additional fiscal constraints are likely to make it even more difficult.",
        "With that, against the background of the concern of the debt crisis in Europe and the dovish speech of ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet in his announcement about leaving the interest rate unchanged (despite a rise in the level of inflation to 2.7 percent in March) and the sharp drop in commodity prices, the dollar strengthened 2.1 percent against the euro since the last monetary policy meeting.",
        "A forecast rise in the US interest rate was pushed off form March-April to June.",

        "The European Union commissioner for monetary policy, Olli Rehn, said that the situation in Greece is especially serious, and that Greece's economy is expected to contract by 3.5 percent this year.",
        "In addition, rumors around Greece's desire to leave the Euro bloc (which were denied by Greece and Germany) again raised questions regarding the ability of countries on the periphery of the Euro bloc to avoid, in the end, bankruptcy.",
        "The head of the European division of the International Monetary Fund warned of an expansion of the debt crisis in Europe to its core countries and developing markets in Eastern Europe, and expressed willingness to expand the aid to Greece if that country would ask, but pointed out that Greece has the ability to raise hundreds of billions of euros through privatizing assets held by its government, a step that Greece should have already taken according to the first agreement.",
        "Market assessments are that Greece cannot allow itself to actually separate from the euro bloc, and in effect is trying to pressure the major countries in Europe to accept easings in aid – since Greece's abandonment of the euro bloc would hurt not only it but the entire bloc.",
        "According to BIS figures, European bank exposure to Greece was about €100 billion.",
        "According to investment house estimates, Greek banks hold about €50 billion in Greek bonds and their collapse would put other banks on the continent at risk, and would be liable to create a chain reaction which would jeopardize the stability of the entire banking system in Europe.",
        "In addition, a Greek bankruptcy will lead to a significant loss for the ECB, which is exposed to Greece with about €200 billion which are funded primarily by Germany and France, and would raise the cost of raising debt for the other PIGS countries, and as such would be likely to weaken and even threaten the euro and the entire bloc.",
        "In light of this, investment houses believe that the threat of Greece leaving will lead to expanding the extent of the aid by an additional €60 billion which should cover Greece's debt payments through the end of 2013.",
        "Despite the expectations of expanded aid to Greece, a lack of investor confidence in Greece's ability to rebuild is expressed in the inverted yield curve (with a two-year yield of 25 percent) and the fact that 85 percent of respondents to a Bloomberg survey believe that Greece, at one point or another, will be forced to default.",
        "In addition, the gaps between the major economies and peripheral economies of the euro bloc are widening.",
        "First quarter growth in the euro bloc surprised to the upside (2.5 percent on an annualized basis, compared with a forecast of only 2.2 percent), but this was due to Germany which surprised with annualized growth of 5.2 percent, which compensated for Greece which contracted 4.8 percent (as opposed to growth of 3.2 percent in the last quarter).",
        "The inflation rate in the euro bloc continues to rise, and in April reached 2.8 percent in annual terms.",
        "With that, Trichet's speech was seen as crucial and another interest rate hike is not expected before July.",
        "China also appears to be showing signs of a slowdown this month (relative to its terms of growth) with a drop in industrial production, in consumer sales, and its purchasing managers' index in the manufacturing sector.",
        "This slowdown did not show up in a moderation of inflation, which remained high and fell less than expected to 5.3 percent in April.",
        "This led the central bank to raise its reserve ratio this month by 50 basis points, the fifth rise this year.",
        "World stock markets were influenced by the debt crisis in Greece much more than by European growth figures which were a pleasant surprise.",
        "The falls began after the US announced the elimination of Osama bin Laden, which led to a rise in the level of risk aversion around the world, with the MSCI World Index down 2.3 percent and the emerging market EMCI Index down 6 percent since the last monetary survey.",
        "At the same time, bond markets showed a drop in yields against the background of risk aversion and investors seeking a safe haven, and US yields fell 25-30 basis points in the 5-10 year range, and in Germany there was a drop of 15-20 basis points in the same range.",

        "policy discussions show that activity in the high-tech industries and exports leveled off, due to the moderation in activity abroad.",
        "The second National Accounts estimate of the growth of GDP in the second quarter, a 3.5 percent annual rate, was slightly higher than the original estimate, the result of an upward revision of the figures of exports, private consumption, and investment.",

        "The S&P credit rating agency raised Israel's credit rating to A+ from its previous A, with a \"stable\" outlook; this was attributed to the government's policy of reducing of the debt/GDP ratio, the potential deriving from the discoveries of natural gas, and the stability of the banking system.",
        "The second National Accounts estimate for the second quarter of 2011 shows a slight improvement compared with the first estimate.",

        "The debt crisis continued to worsen this month as well: in Greece, CDS spreads indicated a growing probability of default in the near future; in the past week S&P cut its credit rating for Italy, with a negative outlook; there was growing concern of the European debt crisis spreading to the banking system, and amid that, credit ratings on large banks in the US, France, and Italy were cut.",

        "Following the current discussions on the interest rate for October, three members recommended that the Governor leave the interest rate unchanged at 3.25 percent, and two recommended that he reduce the rate by 0.25 percentage points to 3.0 percent.",
        "Participants in the discussion dealt with several issues: the inflation environment, real economic activity in Israel, the housing market, and the risks deriving from the global environment.",
        "The marked moderation in Israel's inflation environment was noted: inflation in the previous twelve months was 3.4 percent, still above the upper limit of the inflation target, but over the last six months the rate of inflation, seasonally adjusted, has been close to the lower limit of the inflation target range.",
        "It was stated that the factors contributing to inflation included the housing market (in the last year), and food and energy prices.",
        "Together with the slowdown in actual inflation, expected inflation as reflected in the markets also declined: one-year forward inflation expectations calculated from the capital market (break-even inflation) continued to fall this month too, and are currently at the center of the target range.",
        "In the discussion the point was made that the economic indicators published this month continue to show that domestic economic activity is still growing, but at a slower pace than in 2010 and in the first quarter of 2011.",
        "The slowdown was mainly the result of the easing of world demand and its effect on exports.",
        "Recently there has been increasing concern over a negative turnaround in activity in the US and the eurozone and over the geopolitical risks.",
        "House prices were also discussed: these had risen another 0.4 percent this month, bringing the increase over the last twelve months to 12.3 percent.",
        "Although the rate of increase is somewhat slower than in the last few months, it is still high.",
        "The increase in rents is also continuing at a quick pace.",
        "That said, it is assessed that the increase in housing starts, along with steps by the Bank of Israel in the mortgage market and measures taken by the Ministry of Finance in real estate taxation, will help moderate the rate of price increases.",
        "The risks arising from the global environment include primarily the intensification of the debt crisis of peripheral eurozone countries, reflected in widening CDS spreads for Greece and a credit rating cut for Italy; the concern of the crisis spreading to the banking system, seen in lowered credit ratings of large banks in the US, France, and Italy; and the lowered growth and world trade forecasts.",
        "These risks are liable to lead to a negative impact on economic activity in Israel, primarily on the exporting sector.",
        "In light of the background situation described in the discussion, three members of management recommended leaving the interest rate unchanged, while two recommended reducing the rate.",
        "The main argument in favor of cutting the interest rate by 0.25 percentage points was based on the combination of risks from the global arena.",
        "The impact of these risks, if realized, were expected to be mainly on exports, so that lowering the interest rate would reduce the effect on GDP both via the exchange rate and via domestic demand.",
        "The main considerations favoring leaving the interest rate unchanged in the meantime were concern of a continued increase in housing prices (rents) and home prices as well as the high level of economic activity.",
        "In this framework, the concern was raised that despite the increase in inventory of houses and the steps taken by the Bank of Israel and the Ministry of Finance, lowering the interest rate is liable to lead to acceleration in the rate of increase of home prices.",
        "In addition, the economy is at a high level of activity, apparently around full employment.",
        "Taking all the above into consideration, the Governor decided to cut the interest rate for October by 0.25 of a percentage point, to 3.0 percent.",
        "In announcing the decision, the Bank of Israel emphasized the following points that led to the decision to reduce the interest rate: - Assessments have firmed recently that the slowdown in global growth will be steeper than previously expected.",
        "The IMF reduced its forecast of US growth in to 1.1 percent and it is assessed that the balance of risks is negative.",
        "- The weakness of the US and European economies led policymakers in those countries to adopt more expansionary measures (Operation Twist in the US, and other steps in the eurozone to increase liquidity).",
        "There are now market expectations of a cut in the ECB interest rate.",
        "In addition, volatility has increased in capital markets around the world, and the downward trend in prices of financial assets continues.",
        "- The more severe global slowdown is reflected in slower growth of real activity in Israel, and in particular in the weakness of goods exports.",
        "The Bank of Israel has lowered its growth forecast for 2012 from 3.9 percent to 3.2 percent, and in the Israeli economy too the balance of risks is to the downside.",
        "- Inflation expectations for the next twelve months as calculated from the capital market have remained stable this month around the midpoint of the 1–3 percent target range, and those of the forecasters continued to decline towards the midpoint of the inflation target range, and are currently 2.3 percent.",
        "The cumulative change in the last six monthly CPI readings, seasonally adjusted, is consistent with the lower bound of the target inflation range.",
        "Nevertheless, inflation over the previous twelve months, 3.4 percent, is still above the target range.",
        "The Bank of Israel's staff forecast and professional forecasters' expectations of the inflation rate at the end of 2011 or the beginning of 2012, measured over the previous twelve months, are within the target range.",
        "- The rate of increase in house prices in the last twelve months continues to be high, but in the last few months some moderation has been evident, and in the twelve months to June–July the rate was 12.3 percent (compared with 12.1 percent to May–June).",
        "The effects of the measures taken by the Bank of Israel with regard to mortgages, changes in real estate taxation introduced by the Ministry of Finance, and the sustained increase in building starts are expected to continue to contribute to this moderation in the coming year.",
        "The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli economy and the global economy and in financial markets.",
        "The Bank will use the instruments available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, including keeping a close watch on developments in assets markets, including the housing market.",
        "Director of the Research Department Finance Division, Research Department Despite several economic figures for July that indicated a positive trend, including an increase in personal income and private consumption, the continued expansion of consumer credit and a decline in the trade deficit due to export growth, most of the data for August indicate a slowdown in growth.",

        "The number of jobs did not increase in the US, and the unemployment rate stayed unchanged at 9.1 percent, with those unemployed for half a year or longer accounting for 43 percent of the total number of unemployed.",
        "The number of \"involuntary\" parttime workers (i.e., those who would prefer full-time employment) also increased, and the average number of hours worked weekly dropped.",
        "Labor productivity in the nonagricultural business sector declined in the second quarter by 0.7 percent, annual rate, while in manufacturing the drop was greater, 1.5 percent.",
        "According to Moody's assessment, the US president's $447 billion employment encouragement plan, that includes expenditure on improving infrastructures, direct aid to states and municipalities, cuts in tax on labor, benefits to businesses that recruit new workers, tax benefits for small businesses, extending the period of entitlement to unemployment benefits, and increasing the number of retraining courses, will all together add about 2 percent to GDP and create 1.9 million jobs.",
        "The continued rise in the level of inflation to the 2008 level, and inflation excluding food and energy to 2 percent, the highest level since 2008, reduces the chances of an announcement of QE3 (a third quantitative easing program).",
        "The debt crisis in Europe continued to worsen this month in light of the concern that Greece was likely to reach the stage of defaulting on its payments in the near future, the lowering of Italy's credit rating by S&P to A, with a negative outlook, and concern over the spread of the European debt crisis into the banking system in Europe.",

        "Against the background of a high level of uncertainty regarding the spread of the debt crisis, there are increasing risks of a slowdown in EU member countries.",
        "Those risks resulted in the ECB leaving the interest rate at 1.5 percent, and revising its 2011 growth forecast for the eurozone downwards from 1.5– The markets in the eurozone are factoring in a reduction in the interest rate as early as the next ECB meeting.",
        "Current indicators point to a continued slowdown in the rate of activity: the eurozone PMI (purchasing managers index) dropped to 49 points; new orders in manufacturing were 0.7 percent lower in June than in May; the unemployment rate was unchanged at problems, such as Spain, Ireland, Portugal and Greece, even higher.",
        "Retail trade increased at a rate of 0.2 percent in July, but most of the growth was due to relatively rapid rises in the small Eastern Europe economies, and it is expected that the steps that many governments will have to take to reduce their debts will have a negative impact on private consumption and growth.",

        "The weakness in world trade and the process of raising interest rates in the US place the recovery in some emerging economies at risk.",
        "In China, positive data on activity were reported, and there was a moderate increase in inflation.",

        "In their discussion on inflation, the Committee members noted that although the CPI for November was similar to November CPI readings in previous years, it was lower than the forecasts formulated regarding it and than other previous CPI readings, whose figures were consistent with the inflation target’s seasonal path.",
        "Inflation over the preceding 12 months remains negative, despite the weakening of the effects of initiated price reductions and of declines in energy prices.",

        "The Committee emphasized that medium and long term expectations remained anchored within the target range.",
        "One of the Committee members noted that in his assessment, the decline in prices in recent years is an indication of a process of the price levels for some products in Israel aligning with a new level, similar to those in advanced economies in Europe.",
        "This is a long term process, rooted in the social protests of 2011, that is supported by government policy to reduce the price of imports and enhance competition, and benefits from a tailwind from low inflation in Europe, and the relative appreciation of the shekel against European currencies.",
        "Medium and long term inflation expectations indicate that the capital market assesses that this is a process that will continue for several years.",
        "However, the capital market also assesses that the Bank of Israel will maintain inflation within the bounds of the target range over the long term.",

        "The Committee members assessed that the high rate of growth of private consumption is based mostly on labor income and is not accompanied by an increase in household leverage.",
        "The Committee members emphasized the labor market’s resilience: in their assessment, it is near to full employment, which derives from a high and stable level of participation, an increase in the number of job vacancies, and continued wage increases.",
        "In the discussion on the global environment, the Committee members said that most central banks worldwide continue to adopt very accommodative monetary policy, while in the US, the Federal Reserve increased the federal funds rate and the expected path of the interest rate rose as well.",

        "The Committee members noted that in the past month, the nominal effective exchange rate continued its trend of appreciation vis-à-vis the dollar while the dollar strengthened worldwide, and they discussed the effect of the exchange rate on the development of exports.",
        "It was noted that while services exports returned to growth, the appreciation against European currencies is negatively impacting goods exports.",

        "They noted that home prices are continuing to increase at a rapid pace.",

        "One Committee member noted that in his assessment, the interest rate path indicated by the Research Department forecast that was presented to the Committee is lower than what is reasonable to assume will prevail in actuality.",
        "In his assessment, in light of the situation in the labor market and real economic activity in Israel, which indicates that the low inflation rate is not a result of weak demand, the gap between the forecast for the expected interest rates in the US and Israel is too wide, despite the assessment that the interest rate in Europe will remain negative.",
        "Following the discussion, the four members of the Monetary Committee voted on the Bank of Israel interest rate for January 2017.",
        "All members supported keeping the interest rate unchanged at 0.1 percent.",
        "The decision to keep the interest rate for January 2017 unchanged at 0.1 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel's monetary policy, which is intended to return the inflation rate to within the price stability target range of 1–3 percent a year, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability.",
        "The Monetary Committee continues to assess that in view of the inflation environment, and of developments in the global economy, in the exchange rate, as well as in monetary policies of major central banks, monetary policy will remain accommodative for a considerable time.",
        "Following are the main considerations underlying the decision: - The CPI for November declined by 0.4 percent, a greater decline than had been expected, and below the seasonal path consistent with achieving the inflation target.",
