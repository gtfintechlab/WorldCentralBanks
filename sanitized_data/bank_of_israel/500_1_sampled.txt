The recent increases in the Bank of Israel interest rate, together with the increase in building starts (compared with the equivalent period a year ago) are likely to help moderate the rise in house prices.
World financial markets exhibited a positive trend.
The Committee discussed the moderating inflation environment and expectations for inflation for the coming year, which are slightly below the midpoint of the inflation target range.
In the month between the last interest rate decision and the current one there was a marked deterioration in the global financial crisis.
After an extended discussion, three Committee members were of the opinion that the interest rate should be kept at its current level.
Orders for durable goods also fell relatively sharply.
With regard to the decision on the interest rate for March, with the intention of reducing the cost of credit and strengthening the economy's ability to handle the effects of the decline in demand, and given the assessments that a cut in the interest rate was consistent with the rapid reduction in inflation and that inflation was likely to drop below the target range in 2009, the Governor decided to reduce the interest rate for March by 25 basis points to 0.75 percent.
Most of the increase was in the public sector.
In addition, the failure to approve the Administration’s new assistance plan in the amount of $450 billion, which includes tax benefits for problematic sectors, is liable to reduce GDP by up to about 2 percent, particularly since the previous programs are coming to an end.
This is the first time that in the course of the discussions on the interest rate, the Research Department presented a quarterly forecast that combines various indicators derived from models for forecasting inflation and real developments with discretionary assessments incorporated in an expanded DSGE (dynamic stochastic general equilibrium) model that brings together the information to obtain a consistent forecast.
The interest on 10-year CPI-indexed bonds rose from an average of 3.4 percent in October to 3.5 percent in November.
The forecast was lowered due to the slowdown reflected in published data on Israel's economy, mainly National Accounts figures for the third quarter, and to the expectation of a global slowdown, against the background of the debt crises in Europe and their implications, and the forecast slowdown in major emerging markets.
Outstanding housing credit increased in the twelve months to end-April by 14.1 percent, to NIS 243 billion.
The government's focused plans to ease credit terms for real estate and improve employment, and a QE3 which will focus on mortgages are likely to contribute to noticeable improvement in these two markets which depend on each other and which have been floundering since the beginning of the crisis.
The US economy grew by 3 percent in the fourth quarter, the highest rate of increase since the second quarter of consumer confidence, retail sales, and manufacturing data in the US all indicate expansion.
As expected, the Fed left the interest rate unchanged, and repeated that it expected the near-zero rate to remain until mid-2013 at least, but it did not announce another quantitative easing program (QE3).
In addition, liquidity and credit problems are becoming increasingly serious and there is deepening concern over the further weakening of financial institutions.
On average, they predicted that inflation one year hence would be 2.3 percent (compared with forecasts of 2.7 percent the previous month).
House prices––which are presented in the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of house prices but are not included in the CPI––rose in February–March at a monthly rate of 1 percent, following their increase of 1.4 percent a month in January–February.
The significant decline in the last year in the share of new rental contracts linked to the dollar was noted––these dropped from about 85 percent of all contracts in January 2007 to about 68 percent in October.
The nominal wage per employee-post in the business sector increased by 4.6 percent in June–August, from its level in June–August 2009, and the real wage by 2.6 percent.
One of the factors contributing to growth in these markets is the increase in inter-zone trade and the increase in domestic demand.
The balance of housing debt was NIS 272 billion at the end of August, an increase of 6.9 percent since August of remained essentially unchanged, while interest rates in the unindexed variable rate segment again increased by about 0.1 percentage points, following a similar increase in August.
In addition, despite the fact that the Purchasing Managers Index in industry rose in April, and the fact that most components of the index – including manufacturing capacity, export demand, and employment – are in an expansionary trend, the index is still below the level of 50 points, and so it points to contraction in activities.
In the twelve months up to and including July 2010 the monetary base measured by the M1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 9.5 percent, reflecting a marked slowdown in the rate of increase of this aggregate, against the background of the increase in the rate of interest.
Expectations for the Bank of Israel interest rate in the coming months are stable.
New mortgages granted in January declined by 14.5 percent, after rising by 9 percent in December.
It was also noted that even at the current level of the interest rate, monetary policy is expansionary, after the reductions in recent months in response to global developments and a slowdown in growth in Israel.
Committee members discussed developments in the exchange rate.
From the previous monetary policy discussion held on December 23, 2012, through January 25, 2013, the Tel Aviv 25 Index declined by about 0.6 percent.
This figure is the result of a decline in receipts of taxes on the capital market, and an increase in receipts of indirect taxes.
The European Central Bank (ECB) assesses that eurozone growth will be and predict negative growth of 0.7 percent in 2012, and global growth of 2.9 percent, compared with the previous forecast of 3.2 percent.
Finance Division, Research Department Dr Ohad Bar-Efrat, Advisor to the Governor and Head of Information and International Affairs Division The latest real economic data on the US economy indicate considerable weakness: GDP declined by a half a percent (annual rate) in the third quarter of 2008––a continuation of the significant and widespread fall in economic activity.
The Committee discussed a number of alternatives regarding monetary steps that can be implemented at this time in view of the situation in the economy.
The main risk to the global growth forecast is that the ongoing crisis in the financial markets will continue to affect domestic demand in the advanced economies and will cause more serious harm to the emerging markets too.
In the light of developments since the previous interest rate decision on 23 July 2007, the discussion focused on participants’ assessments of the high rates of inflation in recent months, the economy’s rapid growth and its effect on inflation, an analysis of the factors affecting the shekel exchange rate, and the implications for Israel’s economy and financial markets of the shocks felt in the previous month in the international financial markets All the department directors participating in the discussion recommended raising the interest rate by 25 basis points to 4.0 percent.
The Bank will use the tools available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, and in this regard will continue to keep a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housing market.
The moderation in the rate on increase of home prices in recent months comes against the background of the continued increase in the number of building starts, the lagged effect of the increase in the interest rate, measures introduced by the Bank of Israel affecting mortgages, and steps taken by the Ministry of Finance in real estate taxation.
At that time Israel’s financial markets remained relatively stable, and the NIS behaved similarly to the currencies of the advanced economies.
Prior to the current interest rate decision, the Bank of Israel interest rate was 1.0–1.25 percentage points higher than the US federal funds rate, and 0.25 percentage points higher than the ECB rate.
With that, against the background of the concern of the debt crisis in Europe and the dovish speech of ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet in his announcement about leaving the interest rate unchanged (despite a rise in the level of inflation to 2.7 percent in March) and the sharp drop in commodity prices, the dollar strengthened 2.1 percent against the euro since the last monetary policy meeting.
Within this framework, it appears that growth rates in several countries around the world, even those outside Europe, declined.
Committee members also discussed the extent to which the recent months' increase in geopolitical risk in the region affected the underperformance of Israel's stock market relative to world stock markets, the depreciation of the shekel against the dollar, and the exit of capital from Israel.
Since the beginning of the year short-term real interest has risen by one percentage point.
The Committee members noted that the growth in imports also supports the assessment that the slowing rate of growth reflects a supply constraint, as the increase in domestic demand is satisfied by imports and less so by domestic production.
The easing of the debt crisis in Europe, the continuing improvement in the United States, and particularly the LTRO tenders, continue to be the major factors supporting the positive sentiment in capital markets worldwide.
There is an apparent slight easing in the labor shortage constraint as reported by employers in a number of industries, and the job vacancy rate remains high but is declining moderately.
Committee members discussed developments in fiscal policy as well.
The impact on home prices of the LTV ratio limitations, which were imposed by the Supervisor of Banks and went into effect at the beginning of November, was not reflected in December mortgage data, but is expected to be seen beginning in January.
The major harm on real activity will be felt through tourism.
It also announced its intention of ending its program of purchases of mortgage backed securities (MBS) at the end of March, as planned, but left itself the freedom to renew its intervention in the market if necessary.
Over the past 12 months, prices of tradable goods in the CPI declined by 2.2 percent, and the prices of nontradable items increased by 0.5 percent.
Several weak spots still persist: the marked divergence between the acceleration in global production and the sluggishness in the services sector; the continued severity of bank credit terms; and the weakness of the US labor market.
Tax revenues in the three months August–October, seasonally adjusted and allowing for changes in tax legislation and nonrecurring receipts, were 2.5 percent higher than in May–July.
That member explained that the rate of inflation for the past 12 months had been above the path consistent with price stability and that expectations of inflation as derived from the capital market for the coming year, as well as the assessments of forecasters, are above the center of the target range.
With that, after publication of the October CPI, expectations rose slightly to 1.9 percent.
Committee members discussed the vigorous activity in the housing market and the elevated volume of new mortgages extended to home buyers.
In the three months December to February the nominal wage per employee post increased by 6.4 percent compared with the average in the previous three months, and the real wage increased by 3.3 percent (seasonally adjusted, in annual terms).
The Committee also discussed the uncertainty at the current time in view of the cyclicality of waves of morbidity, and the political uncertainty in Israel. '
Forecasters' one-year inflation expectations stood at 2.2 percent in March and April, with the range of their forecasts narrowing in April to between capital market and those of forecasters have been close to the midpoint of the target range for more than a year.
They noted that the inflation registered in the local component (of the consumer price index) indicated the force of demand in the economy acting on inflation, and though these forces were currently being offset by the strengthening of the shekel, they are still in the pipeline.
The ECB interest rate is still 1 percent, and is expected to remain at that level until the first quarter of 2011 at least.
The composite state-of-the-economy index for March showed another decline, of 0.9 percent, following the declines (month-on-month) of 1.2 percent in February, 1.4 percent in January and 1.1 percent in December.
The seasonally adjusted monthly rise in the index in the last three months, particularly the index excluding owner-occupied housing, was significantly slower than that in the previous six months.
After taking all the above into consideration, the Governor decided to raise the interest rate for August by 25 basis points to 4 percent, in order to support the return of inflation and inflation expectations to around the middle of the target range.
In the current discussions on the interest rate for March, three members of management participated in the discussion, and all three recommended that the Governor increase the interest rate by 0.25 of a percentage point, to 2.5 percent.
Their assessment was that these factors do not reflect a weakness of demand.
The Bank of Israel Research Department's most recent macroeconomic forecast was formulated in June.
Of the total housing credit advanced in December, 47 percent was unindexed at floating interest rates, compared with the monthly average of 50.4 percent in the whole of 2010.
The financial markets reacted with stability to the events in the north.
Germany and France actually recorded positive growth of 0.3 percent.
Since the beginning of the year this index has climbed by 13 percent.
About half of the forecasters expected the interest rate for June to rise, and the other half expected no change in the rate.
As such, market assessments are that the US Federal Reserve is expected to begin raising the interest rate already in March, and that the ECB is also expected to raise the interest rate this year.
In addition, the Committee members noted that despite the increase in inflation in recent months, it remains relatively low, so that it is at the bottom of the distribution among OECD countries.
GDP is changing consistently with these developments, with increases in capital utilization and labor productivity.
In May, the stock of vacant homes available for sale remained stable at 21,000, after a trend of increase in the past year.
The investment houses expect, on average, growth in Europe to reach 2.6 percent in 2007.
In the second quarter the index rose by 0.7 percent, compared with an increase of 1.4 percent in the first quarter.
Nevertheless, they noted that activity was still at a low level, that the output gap was expected to continue widening, and that unemployment was expected to increase in the next few months.
The extent of uncertainty regarding the extent and duration of the fighting is high, and this has an effect on the extent of adverse impact on activity as well.
The Committee members assessed that the effects of the depreciation have not been fully expressed, and that it is expected to continue to support exports and growth, and will continue to contribute to returning inflation to the price stability target range.
As noted, there was a significant dampening of the risk-off atmosphere (risk aversion), which was also reflected in the decline of the VIX index to 31 points from about 41 points last month.
In its announcement of the decision, the Bank of Israel stressed the following conditions that led to the above decision: - Inflation in the last twelve months was close to the midpoint of the target inflation range, but inflation expectations calculated from the capital market for one year ahead and those of the private forecasters remain in the area of the upper limit of the target inflation range.
In June, the nonfinancial business sector issued bonds totaling NIS 3.6 billion, higher than the average over the past 12 months (NIS 2.8 billion), and foreign companies continued to issue bonds at a relatively high pace.
The CPIindexed bonds yield curve became steeper: long-term yields increased by between 12 b.p.
Among the contributing factors to the decline in consumer prices were the continued decline in the food and fruit and vegetables components, and the moderation in the increase in the housing component, with the latter remaining unchanged this month.
The composite state-of-the-economy index rose by 0.4 percent in February, which indicates that economic activity continued to expand, though at a slower pace than in the previous few months.
In the last twelve months the CPI rose by 3.6 percent, 0.5 percentage points of which were attributable to government actions (mainly changes in the VAT rate and the water surcharge).
These cuts, against the background of the relatively stable inflation expectations for one year forward, had reduced the short term real interest rate to a low level, thus encouraging economic activity.
The banking sector around the world, specifically in Europe, is under pressure due to its exposure to bonds of countries in difficulty.
A summary view of the economic situation available at the time of the Committee’s discussion is presented in the [notice regarding the interest rate decision, which was](https://www.boi.org.il/en/NewsAndPublications/PressReleases/Pages/28-8-19.aspx) The members of the Monetary Committee participating in the discussion decide on the appropriate rate of interest.
Despite a downward adjustment to the figure for GDP in the fourth quarter of 2009 from 1.1 percent to 0.9 percent, that is still a good figure for growth in Japan, as it is based also on consumption and not only on exports.
The Bank's assessment of growth in the third quarter of 2009 was about 2.1 percent (annual rate, compared with the previous quarter, seasonally adjusted), compared with growth of 1 percent in the second quarter of the year, and a negative 3.3 percent in the first.
Under the assumption that the state’s income from the sale of Iscar, totaling NIS 4.5 billion, will be received in the course of 2006, total government revenue is likely to exceed the budget forecast significantly.
It should be mentioned that the contractionary measures taken in some economies (raising of the interest rate and regulatory measures), which were meant to prevent overheating, together with signs of a slowdown in the developed economies, the high level of volatility in the financial markets and the outflow of capital, have increased fears of a more significant slowdown in growth in these markets.
The yield on one-year _makam increased to about 2.2 percent in April, from about 2.0 percent in_ March.
In the US, economic activity remained at a high level, and above the trend, and the labor market remained tight.
Goods exports excluding ships, airplanes and diamonds dropped by 5.7 percent in August, after falling 2.8 percent in July.
The risk of default of some European countries as reflected by the high yields on their bonds and by their CDS spreads were expressed this month in the downgrading of the sovereign credit rating of major European economies.
The World Bank slightly raised its 2010 growth forecast for the Far Eastern economies, from 8.7 percent to 8.9 percent.
The Committee members noted that the year over year inflation rate remained low, below the lower bound of the target range, but that 1-year expectations remained stable near the lower bound of the target range.
Forecasts of growth in Europe were revised downwards, and according to the Eurostat forecast, growth in the eurozone in 2009 is expected to be between minus one percent and zero, and in 2010, between 0.5 percent and 1.5 percent.
Second, the decline in goods exports from Israel was affected by temporary labor disruptions in the chemicals industry.
Tel-Bond yield gaps vis-à-vis government bonds narrowed this month.
The impact on inflation of these developments is expected to continue to be felt in the future.
The Tel-Bond indices showed only small movement: the Tel-Bond 20 index dropped by 0.2 percent, and the Tel-Bond 40 by government bonds widened just a little, by about 2 b.p, as yields on government bonds also increased.
The most important data regarding the severity of the crisis and how long it will last relate––the housing market––continue to present a bleak picture, but activity declined at a slightly slower pace.
The cumulative extent of the crisis is beginning to be felt in the labor market and is reflected in an increase in the number of people laid off due to businesses being closed.
They were of the opinion that this low interest rate level supports the recovery of economic activity and the gradual return of the inflation rate to within the target range, and in particular in view of the fact that the government bond purchase program continues and that the Committee decided on the 3 new steps.
The number of salaried posts in the economy rose in the last quarter of 2007 by 4.9 percent relative to the same period in 2006.
The surplus on balance-of-payments current account continued to grow in the first half of 2006, and reached $3.6 billion (almost 5.5 percent of mid-year GDP).
On average, the Israeli forecasters assess that the CPI for April, May and June will rise by a total 0.6 percent, and that inflation viewed retrospectively over twelve months is expected to be below the target range for most of 2007.
The UK, despite positive GDP growth in the last quarter of 2009 and a rise in the consumers' confidence index, also faces the risk of a debt crisis.
The Tel-Bond 20 Index and the Tel-Bond 40 Index increased by 1.4 percent and 1.5 percent, respectively.
Nonetheless, the disappointing figures on wages in the last two months threaten the continuation of this trend.
Eurozone inflation accelerated in February to 0.4 percent, an annual rate of 2.4 percent, the highest rate since October 2008, and the third consecutive month with inflation higher than the 2 percent ECB target.
At a more fundamental level, the prevailing estimate was that long-term players were continuing to bring considerable amounts of long-term capital into the economy.
Home prices, which are presented in the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of home prices but are not included in the CPI, increased at a monthly rate of 0.4 percent in June–July, after rising 0.2 percent in May–June (an estimate that was revised down this month).
The Committee members were of the opinion that this step will strengthen the program’s support of liquidity and of the orderly functioning of the Israeli bond markets.
Thereafter, in light of concern over a possible increase in the interest rate in China, there was a sharp correction to commodity prices.
In the discussion on the global environment, the Committee members said that most central banks worldwide continue to adopt very accommodative monetary policy, while in the US, the Federal Reserve increased the federal funds rate and the expected path of the interest rate rose as well.
Furthermore, in his opinion the current rate of interest is lower than that appropriate to equilibrium in the domestic asset markets in light of the persistent increase in house prices and the continued increase in outstanding mortgages.
During the month since the previous interest rate discussions, the shekel strengthened against the dollar, from about NIS 3.58 to the dollar (on February 25[th]) to NIS 3.52 (on March 24[th]), i.e., an appreciation of about 1.7 percent.
The shekel strengthened by about 2.2 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate.
Outstanding credit to households declined by 0.2 percent, to NIS 360 billion.
The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor worldwide economic developments and the situation in Israel closely, and will act to encourage employment and growth, to support the stability of the financial system, and to achieve price stability.
In this context it was noted that activity had actually accelerated in the last few months, as reflected in the recent rises in the composite state-of-the-economy indices.
The government's support programs and the reviving private sector continue to constitute the main engines of growth.
The Composite State of the Economy Index increased by job vacancy rate, but declines in goods exports and in industrial production were notably negative components.
They added that they did not expect the rise in commodity prices to continue to act as a major inflationary element in 2008.
The Committee discussed the impacts of the war on financial markets and the foreign exchange market.
According to data form the US Department of Transportation, the stock of vehicles held by households is approaching unprecedentedly low levels, so that the US economy may enjoy the benefit of support from a continued increase in vehicle production.
Rates of interest on indexed fixed- and floating-interest-rate mortgages continued to decline, and those on unindexed floating-rate mortgages remained stable in the last few months.
The marked decline in the unemployment rate in the second quarter, reflecting the continued narrowing of the output gap, was discussed.
As a result of the cut in the Bank of Israel interest rate for February and the rise in inflation expectations, the expected real interest rate for one year forward fell in February from a level of 3.6 percent to about 2.9 percent, its lowest level in the last year.
Though share prices fell and the NIS depreciated, these changes occurred within the first few days of fighting.
Such purchases of medium- and long-term bonds on the secondary market directly supports the lowering of interest in the economy also for longer terms, thereby helping to support economic activity.
Against this background, there were sharp declines in equity markets around the world, and yield spreads widened between distressed debt countries and the US, and between distressed debt countries and Germany.
In contrast, the Committee member who recommended leaving the interest rate unchanged felt that despite the risks to growth seen from developments abroad, growth is still stable, while there are marked risks to the stability of growth stemming from fiscal policy.
However, even under such a scenario, some harm is possible to some industries such as the construction and tourism industries.
They argued that a cut of this magnitude reflected a balance between opposing forces.
Data published since the previous interest rate discussions indicate that the expansion in real economic activity in Israel is continuing, with increased uncertainty regarding the continuation of the rapid rate of growth.
The war has significant economic ramifications, both on real activity and on the financial markets.
The rise in food and energy prices contributed to this acceleration.
Nonetheless, central banks in several countries that are already growing relatively rapidly continued with the process of increasing their interest rates last month, and are expected to continue to do so in the near future.
However, data on exports going forward remain mixed: there is a positive decline in the percentage of companies reporting a severe constraint of a shortage of export orders (based on the Business Tendency Survey), while at the same a slowing in goods exports is seen in April (based on foreign trade data).
Taking all the above points into consideration, the Governor decided to leave the interest rate for August unchanged at 3.25 percent.
The purchasing managers index rose for the tenth month in succession, and reached exports by France and Germany to Asia.
The surplus in the current account of the balance of payments totaled $2.1 billion in the second quarter of 2009, following a similar surplus ($2.3 billion) in the first quarter.
These reflect the contraction of economic activity in the last few months, with the rate of decline moderating.
The weak European growth figures in the fourth quarter of 2009 support the assessment that the recovery has lost some momentum, with the main disappointment being caused by Germany, the major eurozone engine of growth, which had zero growth in that quarter.
Domestic uses declined by 2 percent in the second quarter (annual rate, change from previous quarter).
Labor market data for the third quarter of 2010 show a continuation of the positive trend: although the rate of unemployment rose slightly in the third quarter compared with the second, this was due to a higher rate of participation on the labor market with a concurrent increase in the employment rate.
Israeli forecasters’ assessment of one-year inflation dropped in the month since the last interest rate decision to 1.5 percent, on average, below the midpoint of the target range.
In addition, the Committee discussed developments in the global economy, particularly the effects of the war in eastern Europe on oil and other commodity prices and the transmission to domestic inflation, as well as the rapid growth in advanced economies alongside high inflation and the beginning of a contractionary monetary policy process that followed it.
That would have the effect of moderating the rate of inflation in the course of 2010.
The Committee has therefore decided that conditions allow for the start of a gradual process of increasing the interest rate.
Nonetheless, the implications for the supply of energy resources are likely to be significant and long term, and are likely to impact on future growth.
The Committee members noted that certain factors can delay the return of inflation to the target at this time, including (1) the decline in oil prices—in recent days there was a decline, and if it continues it is likely to slow inflation, and (2) increased competition—competition has been enhanced, among other reasons, because online purchases of consumer goods have expanded markedly in the past decade.
In the month between the previous interest rate discussions and the current ones, concern mounted over the budget deficits and debts of several European countries, leading to sharp changes in financial markets.
The yield to maturity on unindexed government bonds increased along almost the entire curve, by up to 29 basis points The yield to maturity on one-year _makam increased over the period by 18 b.p., to_ about 2.41 percent.
Political pressures to increase budget spending both to improve defense preparedness disengagement spending will be lower in 2007 than it was in 2006. and to tackle welfare-related issues increased uncertainty about the government’s budget decision before it was approved in September.
In March the IMF published a forecast of negative world growth in 2009 of between 0.5 percent and 1 percent (annual rate), compared with its previous forecast in October 2008 of The Bank of Israel uses econometric models to test various scenarios.
Against this background, the ECB left the interest rate unchanged at one percent.
Nevertheless, the forecasters and the Fed continue with their assessment that at least part of the recent slowdown is due to temporary factors, including the severe winter weather that adversely impacted on the construction industry, the damage to the supply chain caused by the earthquake in Japan, and the increase in commodity (in particular fuel) prices to levels that affect consumption and growth, and they therefore hope that the US market will improve in the second half of the year.
There was an examination of Israel’s inflation environment, which despite the April CPI data remains low compared to most advanced economies worldwide.
Committee members are of the opinion that important factors in the increase in home prices at this time are a slowing of planning processes and the decline in the rate of marketing properties.
Mortgage volume continued to be high.
The three participants who recommended reducing the interest rate by one percentage point for January were of the opinion that the larger cut in the rate would increase the effectiveness of the policy of supporting growth, and that the risks associated with a one-percentage-point reduction in the interest rate were not high.
Manufacturing production came as a positive surprise with the sharpest increase for seven years, and various confidence indices continue to indicate expansion.
The Committee discussed the potential for declines in financial markets and the lack of stability seen in them in recent weeks to impact on the domestic economy.
The Committee members discussed the moderation of global economic activity, the downward revision of global growth forecasts, and the change in expectations regarding the path of global interest rates and monetary policy.
While the relatively high growth rate in the fourth quarter was impacted by volatility in vehicle imports, growth was still 3.7 percent in the second half of the year as a whole.
The members assessed that the slowdown in the second and third quarters apparently derived partly from the growth rate declining from the high rate of recent years, to its potential environment, and partly from transitory factors— the volatility in vehicle imports.
At the same time, inflation expectations from various sources for the next 12 months show stability after the increase they registered last month.
Taking into consideration the high degree of uncertainty regarding the debt crises in the US and in Europe; the slowdown in the global economy and its expected negative effect of Israel's growth already in the second quarter; the interest rate differentials between Israel and the major economies; the moderation of actual inflation, the stable inflation expectations and inflation forecasts; the assessment that the interest rate increases and the measures introduced in the real estate sector will soon start to have an effect, three members of the narrow forum recommended leaving the interest rate unchanged for August.
Although the markets have been calm in the past few days with the fall in share prices moderating, it is not clear if the rise in risk aversion will continue or if it is only temporary.
In contrast, public services[1] registered a drop of 3.1 percent in number of people employed In contrast to the preceding quarter, the expansion in total employment in this quarter was entirely – and more – due to a rise in full-time jobs.
Reports from companies participating in the Bank of Israel’s Companies Survey for the third quarter of 2008 (preliminary results based on reports from about half of the participating companies) indicate that the rate of expansion of business activity was slower than in the previous quarter.
In the last twelve months the housing price index increased by 6.5 percent, compared with increases of 5.9 percent in January and 4.5 percent in December.
Alongside that, the Committee members noted that several other indicators could point to expected moderation in the market: the number of home purchase transactions continues to decline and new mortgage volume in November is approaching the preCOVID-19-crisis average level.
The data presented on real activity indicated that the economy was recovering rapidly from the impact of the fighting in the north.
According to one of the Bank of Israel’s econometric models, the inflation rate of the domestic component of the CPI was 4 percent (2007:Q1 compared with 2006:Q1), while the component of the CPI directly affected by the exchange rate fell by 4.6 percent in the same period.
[3] This was due mainly to the appreciation of the shekel against the euro by about 2.8 percent, and by about 1.7 percent against the dollar.
They also emphasized that the Committee has a variety of tools to expand monetary accommodation if necessary.
The very modest increase in exports (excluding diamonds) was also noted.
In contrast, there has been an increase in new mortgage volume and in borrowers’ LTV ratios while the mortgage interest rate has remained stable.
The output gap and the ending in due course of the effects of the non-recurring price increases that resulted from government actions - The continued gradual recovery in economic activity suggests that the current environment is one of recovery from the recession but there is uncertainty regarding the strength of the recovery in Israel, in part because of the uncertainty about the recovery in the global economy.
The average rate of unemployment is expected to be 6.1 percent in 2008.
That would be consistent with the gradual return to a normal interest rate environment in light of the cumulative increases since the beginning of the year, and is also consistent with the efforts to gradually attain the inflation target, taking into account the other considerations described above.
In this context it should be noted that the transmission between a reduction in the Bank of Israel interest rate and a reduction in the interest changed to borrower by banks is weakened at such low rates of interest.
The December Consumer Price Index (CPI) was unchanged, lower than the Bank of Israel's assessment that it would rise by about 0.4 percent, and the average of that of the private forecasters, of a rise of about 0.3 percent.
However, the (continued) decline in goods exports and in industrial production were notably negative aspects among the components.
The path of the interest rate in the future depends on developments in the inflation environment, growth in Israel and in the global economy, the monetary policies of major central banks, and developments in the exchange rate of the shekel.
It seems that the markets brought forward by a few months their forecast of the timing of an increase in the interest rate in the US.
The forecasters predict that twelve months hence the interest rate will be 2.8 percent.
The nominal yield on unindexed 5-year government bonds rose during the last month by about 0.2 percentage points to an average of 5.4 percent.
National Accounts data indicated high growth and that the level of GDP moved closer to around the level that would have been expected if not for the COVID-19 crisis.

The data also indicate a rise in demand for workers with low earning capacity.
Japan’s economy is showing signs of slowing: industrial production contracted in May and retail sales grew moderately.
The Committee members said that on a seasonally adjusted basis, the recent CPI readings were relatively high, but they noted that certain factors continue to delay the return of inflation at this time, including the government’s activities to reduce the cost of living and to enhance competition, and online purchases of consumer goods having expanded markedly in the past decade.
The main increase occurred in CPI-indexed, fixed interest mortgages, although unindexed floating interest mortgages still constitute the major part of the mortgage market.

The forecast also gave a derived gradual increase in the Bank of Israel interest rate to an average of 2.8 percent in a year's time (the average in the third quarter of 2011).
Despite this, the risk of a sharp correction in the markets remains high, against the backdrop of the high volatility in the various investment channels, and the sensitivity to economic developments worldwide, particularly Europe.
In contrast, following the decline in prices of the imported components of the index over the past year, the fall continued in the first quarter of of the domestic component of the CPI was 4 percent (2007:Q1 compared with Inflation expectations for one year ahead derived from the capital market––breakeven inflation––declined by 0.8 percentage points to 0.5 percent, significantly below than the lower limit of the target range.

The four participants recommending no change stressed the fact that inflation, currently 5 percent measured over the previous twelve months, was significantly above the target range.
For example, preliminary data from the Companies Survey indicate that the second quarter growth rate is around the potential rate.
Based on developments to date and on the assumption of almost complete expenditure of the budget, and assuming the upward trend in tax revenues will persist until the end of the year, the total deficit (excluding credit) in 2010 is expected to amount to less than 4 percent of GDP (compared with the ceiling of 5.5 percent of GDP).
Inflation expectations for the next year as derived from the capital market––breakeven inflation––have been close to the midpoint of the inflation target range for the past three months, and stood at 1.8 percent in August.

With that, Committee members assessed that there is a strong commitment to finding a solution to the crisis, an assessment reflected as well in the positive returns in financial markets around the world during the recent period.
Inflation expectations twelve months forward and beyond, as derived from the capital market, are in the upper part of the target inflation range, despite the expected increase in the interest rate.
Nevertheless, a decline in the private sector leverage ratio and an increase in the saving rate to levels that do not justify a further increase may indicate a chance that a recovery in consumption lies ahead.
Macroeconomic figures published this month in the US were relatively favorable, and were generally better than expected.
A summary view of the economic situation available at the time of the Committee’s discussion is presented in the [notice regarding the interest rate decision, which was](https://www.boi.org.il/en/NewsAndPublications/PressReleases/Pages/25-2-19.aspx) The members of the Monetary Committee participating in the discussion decide on the appropriate rate of interest.
Employment data show that the number of employees fell by about 530,000 in November, and the data for previous months were revised sharply downwards.

The investment houses expect, on average, that the Bank will keep the interest rate unchanged at 0.5 percent till the end of the first quarter of 2009.
With that, the continued decline in investment in residential construction, and the decline in goods and services exports in the second quarter were noted.
- Interest rates of the central banks of the major advanced economies are at very low levels, and in light of recent developments are expected to remain so for some considerable time.
The Central Bureau of Statistics Survey of Business Trends indicates a decline in activity and in new orders in the industry.
Strong global growth, the rise in inflationary pressures and the more hawkish tone from the Federal Reserve, have increased expectations that the central banks will raise their interest rates by more than had been factored into the markets up to now.

The agencies’ rating reductions emphasize the impact of the geopolitical reality, but also reflect the impact of fiscal policy management with an emphasis on the importance of the future policy framework.
The Chinese New Year may account for part of the decline, but it appears that the contractionary policy also played a part.
This is an indication that the recession in the housing market evident for a long time has started to spread to other economic spheres.
Some of the forecasters even expect that the first increase will not be before some time in 2012.

In addition, the nontradable components also moderated.
the low June CPI and the reductions in commodity and energy prices in the last few weeks; the CPI excluding energy, food, and fruit and vegetables in the last twelve months rose by 1.9 percent, i.e., close to the midpoint of the target range; inflation expectations derived from the capital market fell sharply following the publication of the June price index; those members of the committee thought there was a good probability that inflation would return to the target range in the first half of 2009 without raising the interest rate for August; the probability of a rise in the interest rate of the Fed, the ECB or the Bank of England had declined; and the worsening of the global financial crisis in July had increased both the level of uncertainty in the financial markets and concern over a more serious and longer slowdown than expected previously.
A continuation of this trend will delay the return of inflation to the target range.
Others were of the view that interest rate considerations were not the dominant factor in capital flows in the last few months, and they did not expect them to become dominant in the current interest rate environment, even if there was another rate increase.

No significant slowdown was seen, despite a sharp decline in the volume of transactions.
The nominal wage per employee post rose in the business sector fell by 1.3 percent in July, and that in the public sector by 0.7 percent.

Despite this, the Committee members emphasized that the average wage in the economy has not increased at a pace that is in line with the strong demand for employees.
Prior to the current interest rate decision, the Bank of Israel interest rate was 1.25– points higher than the ECB rate.
This step is in line with the drive to gradually return inflation to within the target range, taking into account the other issues noted.
With that, the relatively strong position of Israel's economy currently will allow it to absorb these shocks with a relatively moderate impact.
In light of the background conditions presented, all the members of management supported an increase in the interest rate, and the discussion focused on the amount of the increase, and whether it should be accompanied by a macro-prudential step relating to mortgages.
He was of the opinion that an interest rate lower than 0.1 percent is more appropriate due to the magnitude of the crisis and the adverse impact, anomalous in its magnitude, on the employment level.
The average real wage per employee post increased by 0.4 percent in the third quarter compared with the second, and the nominal wage by 0.7 percent (both seasonally adjusted).
The CBS revised its forecast of growth in 2006 to about 4.5 percent, and the Bank of Israel’s forecast of growth in 2007 is about 4 percent.

Completions in the twelve months to April totaled 33,941, a 7.9 percent increase compared with the number in the twelve months to April 2010.
Despite the improvement in the labor market, most of those joining the labor force are earning low salaries, so that salaries increased at a moderate pace and continue to weigh on a recovery in personal consumption.
