        "All members underlined the decline in the international prices of some commodities, volatility.",
        "They pointed out that disruptions in supply chains have also moderated.",
        "Most pressures on headline inflation have started to diminish.",
        "One member indicated that price-related pressures have decreased due to the effects of the favorable dynamics of the pandemic and to the restrictive stance adopted by various governments and central banks, which has led to a moderation of global spending.",
        "He/she considered that inflation expectations drawn from surveys and those implicit in market instruments have started to decrease at the margin in different countries.",

        "They pointed out that stock markets exhibited a negative performance.",
        "They mentioned that the dollar continued gaining strength, reaching its highest level in 20 years.",

        "Most members expect growth of economic activity during the third quarter of 2022 to slow down with respect to that observed in the first half of the year.",
        "However, they pointed out that after having remained weak in May and June, economic activity recovered in July.",
        "One member stated that said result was supported by the three main economic sectors.",
        "Nevertheless, he/she warned that almost 35% of sectoral activity remains below pre-pandemic levels.",
        "Another member added that economic activity still has not been able to surpass the level reached in April, and that, if timely figures for August are confirmed, economic activity will have remained on a flat trajectory for four consecutive months.",
        "Some members noted that the economy is expected to continue recovering gradually, although at a lower rate, and facing a complex global economic environment that maintains the balance of risks for growth biased to the downside.",
        "On the supply side, most members stated that supported by the sound performance of the manufacturing sector.",

        "Some members highlighted that in August contractual wage revisions in the private sector and those of IMSS-insured workers continued trending upwards, with adjustments close to 7 and 12%, respectively.",
        "One member considered that, although the implementation of pending adjustments in wages is good news, the global indicator of labor productivity has accumulated eight consecutive quarters of contraction and is at levels previously observed in 2009, and that for this reason unit labor costs have increased considerably.",
        "Another member stated that the National Survey of Occupation and Employment (ENOE, for its acronym in Spanish), which includes both formal and informal workers, suggests that wages have not increased significantly in real terms.",
        "In contrast, he/she pointed out that inflation might be having a greater incidence on certain sectors, which would be associated with a heterogeneous recovery.",
        "He/she pointed out that wage revisions have concentrated in the subgroup of formal IMSS-insured workers, where the sectors of construction, agriculture and business-support services stand out.",
        "In contrast, he/she stated that real wages in other sectors are lagging behind.",
        "He/she mentioned that recent studies which decompose wage dynamics of IMSS-insured workers by type of worker, suggest that wage increases can be largely attributed to the 2021 labor outsourcing reform.",
        "He/she deemed it important to assess if such increases will be observed in the future once the effects of said reform dissipate.",
        "Most members pointed out that slack conditions in the economy are expected to continue decreasing.",
        "One member warned that, on the demand side, the negative output gap could be inexistent or even positive if potential GDP turns out to be lower than estimated, or if the negative effects of the labor outsourcing reform are excluded.",
        "Another member argued that economic activity continues showing considerable slack, given that in the second quarter of the year, GDP remained well below its medium-term trajectory and slightly below its pre-pandemic level.",
        "All members emphasized the high inflation levels.",
        "Most members indicated that in the first fortnight of September headline and core inflation registered annual rates of 8.76 and 8.27%, respectively.",

        "One member stated that such upward trajectory has been observed for over 20 months for headline inflation, and for over 18 months for core inflation.",
        "Some members mentioned that inflation has repeatedly been at higher-than-expected levels since early 2021.",
        "One member pointed out that headline inflation does not show signs of reaching its peak.",
        "Nonetheless, another member stated that pressures at the margin on monthly inflation have trended downwards since March.",
        "One member added that both headline and core inflation remain at levels unseen in two decades.",
        "Another member mentioned that even CPI items with more price rigidity register inflation levels above 4%, which indicates generalized pressures.",
        "Most members stated that the high levels of inflation in Mexico are partly attributed to a global phenomenon.",
        "They indicated that although less disruptions references of some commodities have been observed, there are still imbalances between supply and demand in different markets.",
        "Some members pointed out that production costs remain affected by increases in various input prices.",
        "One member mentioned that world inflation, particularly in the United States, needs to show a change of trend for inflation in Mexico to begin decreasing.",
        "However, he/she warned that this would not be sufficient, given that increasing pressures are also being faced at a domestic level.",
        "Most members mentioned that core inflation continued registering high levels.",
        "One member pointed out that this was observed in practically all of its components.",
        "Another member noted that, at the margin, there were lower pressures on monthly core inflation, particularly in food merchandise and services.",
        "Some members highlighted that merchandise inflation is at double-digit levels.",
        "Most members pointed out that food merchandise inflation reached 13.27% in the first half of September.",
        "One member pointed out that this figure is nearly double the one registered a year ago, and that its annual increase in August was more pronounced than that of previous months.",
        "He/she added that this reflects the high levels of international food commodity prices.",
        "Another member mentioned that food merchandise prices have been increasing at double-digit rates for months.",
        "He/she added that in addition to negatively affecting the CPI and the purchasing power of lower-income households, this situation is worrying because consumers perceive these increases as the level of inflation in the economy in general.",
        "Some members pointed out that non-food merchandise inflation continues facing pressures.",
        "Some members noted that it has consolidated at very high levels and one member warned that it has trended upwards this year.",
        "Most members mentioned that services inflation has highlighted that it is at very high levels.",
        "Some members pointed out that this is due to the inflation in tourism and food services.",
        "One member added the inflation in education services as a cause.",
        "Another member deemed that services prices are responding to pressures on input costs and to an increase in demand due to greater mobility.",
        "All members noted that non-core inflation remains at high levels.",
        "Some members mentioned that this is mainly explained by the prices of agricultural and livestock products.",
        "One member highlighted that the non-core component remains at high levels despite government efforts to contain energy inflation.",
        "He/she added that it is not expected to decrease easily.",
        "Another member mentioned that this component registered monthly rates in line with its historical average for three consecutive months.",
        "He/she added that this favorable behavior was observed in energy and in agriculture and livestock products.",
        "One member highlighted that inflation of agricultural and livestock products reached double digits.",
        "He/she pointed out that despite the decrease in international references, energy prices in Mexico have not declined proportionally.",
        "However, another member mentioned that energy prices registered relatively low annual inflation levels.",
        "Most members stated that expectations for headline and core inflation for 2022 and 2023 rose again.",
        "Some members pointed out that this has been in line with the observed increase in inflation.",
        "Most members indicated that medium-term expectations increased slightly at the margin and remained stable, although above the target.",
        "However, some members highlighted that their distribution shows a greater dispersion.",
        "Regarding expectations for core inflation, one member stated that long-term ones decreased at the margin.",
        "In this context, another member mentioned that although medium- and long-term inflation expectations have begun to stabilize, they are still at high levels.",
        "instruments, most members noted that these have continued to deteriorate.",
        "Some members mentioned that those related to the long-term remain slightly above 3%.",
        "Some members noted that breakeven inflation registered generalized increases in all maturities.",
        "Most members stated that, in view of greater- than-anticipated inflationary shocks and an outlook for their effects lasting longer than anticipated, forecasts for headline and core inflation were revised upwards for the entire forecast horizon.",
        "They pointed out that, in the foreseen to converge to the 3% target in the third quarter of 2024.",
        "One member mentioned that pointwise convergence is in line with the time frame in which monetary policy operates and coincides with the anticipated convergence of inflation in several economies.",
        "However, he/she noted that the fact that inflationary shocks could worsen or that new pressures could materialize cannot be ruled out.",
        "Another member highlighted that convergence to the target will take time because lower levels of external inflation do not automatically translate into a decline in domestic inflation, and because of the lag with which the restrictive stance will have an impact.",
        "He/she stated that convergence will be fragile given the continuous emergence of unanticipated shocks.",
        "He/she mentioned that convergence will be difficult to achieve, as it implies that by the second half of is usually observed.",
        "He/she indicated that, in addition to the fact that it has not followed a downward trend, it has a very strong seasonality, and it is volatile.",
        "Likewise, he/she pointed out that there is a divergence for the end of 2023 between our forecasts and analyst expectations, which calls into question the credibility of the trajectory presented, and could contribute to the deterioration of medium- and longterm expectations.",
        "Among upward risks to inflation, most members mentioned the persistence of core inflation at pressures associated with the pandemic and the geopolitical conflict.",
        "One member considered that international reference prices of various commodities have shown a strong correlation with domestic prices and have generated an important pass-through onto domestic inflation, and for that reason it may be a risk if such pass-through shows an asymmetric effect onto the decline in inflation as the price of these commodities declines.",
        "Therefore, he/she stated that, looking ahead, the process of convergence could face significant challenges.",
        "As for wage revisions, another member estimated that these could intensify due to additional increases in the minimum wage, which could rise by more than 20% in the next two years.",
        "One member highlighted that the high levels of inflation seem to have started to affect wage revisions, which could imply the risk of a price-wage spiral.",
        "Another member pointed out that salaries, including those of both formal and informal workers, have not increased significantly in real terms, and therefore it is difficult to argue that there are generalized wage pressures.",
        "One member added the risk of an exchange rate depreciation in light of prospects of tighter global financial conditions.",
        "Another member added that the economy faces increasing domestic pressures.",
        "He/she noted that the output gap could be smaller than currently estimated and pointed out that services prices have increased considerably, even though they are generally non-tradable.",
        "He/she added that weatherrelated factors could exert upward pressure on prices.",
        "He/she stated that various risks are taking place in an environment of low competitiveness in multiple sectors, which could favor price increases.",
        "One member mentioned two risks to public finances that could exert pressure on monetary policy.",
        "First, that the growth levels foreseen in the 2023 Economic Package do not materialize.",
        "Second, that a larger fiscal deficit with greater levels of public spending are observed.",
        "Regarding downward risks, another member highlighted a greater-than-anticipated slowdown in world economic activity, as well as a reduction in the effects of the pandemic and the military conflict on production and distribution chains.",
        "In this context, most members mentioned that the balance of risks for the trajectory of inflation within the forecast horizon remains biased Most members pointed out that domestic financial markets reflected the global dynamics of lower risk appetite and a generalized strength of the US dollar.",
        "They stated that the stock However, they pointed out that the peso remained stable.",
        "They noted a favorable behavior compared to the currencies of most emerging economies.",
        "One member noted that this positive result was also observed with respect to the currencies of advanced economies.",
        "Another member stated that the peso has been more volatile in recent days due to external factors.",
        "Some members highlighted that the sound macroeconomic fundamentals have contributed to the relatively favorable performance of domestic financial markets, particularly of the foreign exchange market.",
        "One member added that exchange rate stability has not only prevented further capital outflows, but also reduced inflationary pressures stemming from imported goods.",
        "Another member indicated that fiscal discipline has also contributed to preserve the credit ratings of public debt.",
        "He/she noted that capital flows to the debt market by non-residents have been negatively affected by the global component, and positively by the idiosyncratic factor.",
        "He/she stated that this explains the better performance of Mexican debt securities relative to those of other emerging economies.",
        "One member pondered that monetary policy actions implemented by Banco de México have led to an attractive volatility-adjusted interest rate spread relative to the United States.",
        "Most members highlighted that interest rates of government bonds increased throughout the entire yield curve.",
        "Some members pointed out that short-term interest rates increased close to 120 basis points.",
        "One member added that medium- and longterm interest rates increased by up to 110 basis points.",
        "Some members highlighted that the yield curve of real interest rate instruments also increased in all its maturities.",
        "Some members considered that this implies a tightening of financial conditions and reflects expectations of a more restrictive monetary policy stance.",
        "One member pointed out that the sovereign default premia rose significantly.",
        "One member highlighted that credit to the productive sector continued recovering.",
        "He/she added that despite an environment of higher interest rates, domestic financing to firms increased in July due to the gradual improvement in credit from commercial banks.",
        "He/she added that consumer credit continues increasing and that banks’ loan portfolio delinquency rates continue declining.",
        "Another member considered that, although it improved at the margin, credit to the productive sectors remained weak and below its pre-pandemic level and its long-term trend.",
        "The Governing Board evaluated the magnitude and diversity of the shocks that have affected inflation and its determinants, along with the evolution of medium- and long-term inflation expectations and the price formation process.",
        "It also considered the increasing challenges for monetary policy stemming from the ongoing tightening of global financial conditions, the environment of significant uncertainty, the inflationary pressures accumulated as a result of the pandemic and the geopolitical conflict, as inflation.",
        "Based on these considerations, and with the presence of all its members, the Board decided unanimously to raise the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 75 basis points to 9.25%.",
        "The Board added that with this action, the monetary policy stance adjusts to the trajectory required for inflation to converge to its The Board will thoroughly monitor inflationary pressures as well as all factors that have an incidence on the foreseen path for inflation and its expectations.",
        "This, in order to set a policy rate that is consistent at all times with both the orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to the 3% target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates as well as with an adequate adjustment of the economy and financial markets.",
        "The Board will assess the magnitude of the upward adjustments in the reference rate for its next policy decisions based One member stated that the environment for conducting monetary policy has become more complicated, in view of inflationary pressures that still show no clear signs of dissipating, and tighter international financial conditions.",
        "He/she argued that since June of last year, throughout the entire inflationary episode associated with the pandemic and the military conflict in Ukraine, Banco de México has increased the reference rate in a timely and decisive manner, including increases of 75 basis points in the latest decisions.",
        "He/she highlighted that this reflects the commitment to the central bank’s primary mandate.",
        "As for the ex-ante real interest rate, he/she mentioned that it is now around the upper bound of the range estimated as neutral, and should be brought into clearly restrictive territory.",
        "He/she pointed out that a 75 basis-point increase would achieve this objective and would reflect the central bank's commitment to its primary mandate, in a context of significant inflationary pressures.",
        "He/she stated that such reinforcement is also necessary to anchor inflation expectations, mainly longer-term ones.",
        "He/she underlined two challenges.",
        "First, that although adjustments in medium- and long-term inflation expectations during the year have been moderate, it is essential to act decisively to avoid an unanchoring process.",
        "He/she warned that, if this process were to materialize, it would affect price formation and significantly jeopardize the convergence of inflation to its target.",
        "Second, that monetary policy actions contributed to an orderly adjustment of financial markets, including the foreign exchange market, and prevented an impact on long term expectations.",
        "However, he/she warned that episodes of greater risk aversion and exchange rate volatility cannot be ruled out, and thus a prudent monetary policy is required to avoid possible negative effects on financial markets.",
        "He/she added that, looking ahead, the hiking cycle must continue and pointed out that the magnitude of subsequent increases should be discussed based on the evolution of inflation and its determinants.",
        "He/she highlighted that inflationary episodes have a regressive impact, affecting lower-income households the most, since they have less access to the formal financial system and, consequently, have fewer alternatives to protect themselves from generalized price increases.",
        "He/she recalled that food prices have risen in greater magnitude, intensifying the regressive effects, since lowerincome households tend to allocate a greater proportion of their spending to these products.",
        "He/she noted that it is essential for the central bank to prevent high inflation from becoming entrenched, as it would have persistent adverse repercussions on poverty, income distribution and, in general, on the well-being of Mexican families.",
        "He/she stated that this is why it is key for the Board to explicitly manifest its commitment to achieving the central bank’s primary mandate.",
        "Another member pointed out that, since the previous monetary policy decision, inflationary pressures, the factors that influence the forecasted trajectory for inflation, as well as its expectations, have deteriorated.",
        "He/she stated that additional factors are added to the deteriorated inflationary environment, at a global and local level, including a juncture of lower liquidity, high exchange rate volatility, greater risk aversion, as well as a deterioration in economic activity, and the possibility of new shocks stemming from the continuation or escalation of geopolitical conflicts.",
        "In his/her opinion, this environment implies that it will be necessary to continue increasing the reference rate, and that it should remain in a more restrictive level throughout the entire horizon in which monetary policy operates.",
        "He/she added that this would contribute to mitigate the deterioration of the price formation process and stop inflationary expectations from increasing, allowing inflation to converge to the target.",
        "He/she pointed out that although the unanchoring process seems to have started, adjustments at the margin in long-term expectations could indicate that pressures are somewhat contained.",
        "He/she considered it convenient to maintain the pace of monetary tightening that has been implemented given that, since the beginning of the hiking cycle, taking into consideration a 75 basis-point increase in the current decision, 525 basis points of increases would have been accumulated and the ex-ante real interest rate would finally be brought to restrictive territory.",
        "He/she added that a 75 basis-point increase would be consistent with the expected trajectory of inflation and would allow it to converge to the 3% target within the forecast horizon.",
        "However, he/she underlined that more adverse global conditions, in an environment of greater uncertainty, could lead the Governing Board to consider modifying the pace of adjustment.",
        "He/she warned that no scenario can be ruled out, and therefore it is fundamental to clearly communicate that: i) the reference rate will continue increasing; ii) the magnitude of the increases will depend on the conditions prevailing at the time of each decision; and iii) it will be necessary for the monetary policy stance to remain restrictive within the forecast horizon, to guarantee the convergence of inflation to the target.",
        "One member considered it necessary to adjust the monetary policy stance in light of the inflation levels and to avoid second-round effects.",
        "He/she underlined that it is essential to continue adopting a restrictive monetary policy stance.",
        "He/she mentioned that with an increase of 75 basis points, the target rate would decidedly lay in restrictive territory and that it is time to evaluate up to when and to what extent the policy stance will be tightened, and what will be the response to additional hikes by the Federal Reserve.",
        "He/she stated that the terminal rate of the cycle would need to be determined based on the ex-ante real interest rate rather than on the nominal interest rate.",
        "He/she stated that the maximum level for the ex-ante real interest rate in recent years was 4.4%, reached in 2018.",
        "Thus, he/she estimated that a possible terminal level of such rate in this cycle could be between 4.5 and 5%.",
        "He/she added that such level would have a significant restrictive effect on economic activity and an impact on economic agents' expectations.",
        "He/she mentioned that, given the level of inflation expectations, said real interest rate level would be reached with a nominal interest rate of between 9.75 and 10%, and thus a higher rate would be unnecessarily restrictive.",
        "He/she warned that this would imply having excessively high levels of real interest rates in the short term that might turn out to be even higher in the future, to the extent that the monetary policy stance affects inflation expectations.",
        "He/she considered it desirable for the hiking cycle to conclude by the end of 2022 and that the restrictive monetary policy stance is maintained throughout He/she pointed out that it is imperative to consider the lag with which monetary policy works and avoid an excessive tightening.",
        "He/she indicated that the restrictive policy would have just begun affecting credit, consumption and investment, and noted that the effect of this stance, along with the decline in international prices of commodities, makes it possible to foresee that inflationary pressures will begin to diminish.",
        "He/she warned that, if ending 2022 with an ex-ante real interest rate close to 5% is to be achieved, the pace of adjustments would need to be reduced, regardless of what the Federal Reserve may do.",
        "He/she expressed that decoupling from the pace of said institution’s interest rate hikes could be feasible as of the next policy decision since: i) Banco de México began its hiking cycle earlier and, considering the proposed hike, it would accumulate points in the federal funds rate are anticipated and Banco de México requires a smaller adjustment; iii) Mexico's ex-ante real interest rate is in restrictive territory, unlike that of the United States; iv) Mexico does not face demand-related or labor market pressures; v) the interest rate spread relative to the United States is close to historical highs and far above the spread calculated with the estimated neutral interest rates for both countries; and vi) Mexico maintains solid macroeconomic fundamentals.",
        "Another member highlighted the importance of having a restrictive monetary policy stance consistent with a complex inflationary landscape.",
        "He/she pointed out that the conditions are not suitable for slowing the pace of interest rate increases and that it could even be debated whether such pace should be accelerated.",
        "Although an increase of 100 basis points would send a strong signal and contribute to contain the deterioration of expectations, it is not advisable since: i) it would lead to an unnecessary increase in the relative stance; ii) an increase that is greater-than that anticipated by the consensus of analysts and market operators would generate uncertainty about future adjustments; iii) there would be the risk of reaching a very high terminal rate, with a pace of adjustment difficult to maintain that would require subsequent reductions, for which there would be no conditions in the coming months; and iv) it would be difficult to justify a strategy of front loading, bringing forward the interest rate hikes, given the uncertainty about the terminal level of the interest rate.",
        "He/she stated that although a significantly restrictive absolute monetary stance would not eliminate the inflation outbreak, it would prevent second-round effects from taking place and the risk of expectations becoming unanchored.",
        "He/she added that an increase of 75 basis points is barely enough to bring the ex-ante real interest rate further into restrictive territory, and thus any fears about reaching an excessively restrictive monetary policy stance, which affects the rate of growth of economic activity, may be ruled out.",
        "He/she highlighted that cyclical conditions become a secondary priority until inflation is brought under control.",
        "He/she argued that with the aforementioned adjustment, the ex-ante real interest rate would be at the maximum level reached during the restrictive cycles of 2008 and 2019.",
        "He/she added that in view of a more complex inflationary outlook, the terminal real interest rate should be higher, even more so than that anticipated by markets, and at a level near 6%, as his/her own models anticipate.",
        "Moreover, he/she argued that it is not possible to implement a hike lower than that of the Federal Reserve not because an automatic rule is followed, but because: i) synchronizing inflationary pressures between both economies demands a similar tightening; ii) a solid relative stance is necessary given expectations of additional increases by the Federal Reserve; iii) a premature decoupling could generate exchange rate volatility and be perceived as a sign of complacency; and iv) an interest rate spread of at least 600 basis points should be maintained at least until the end of the year to support the good performance of the Mexican peso in view of the appreciation of the dollar and the higher volatility.",
        "He/she stated that it should be communicated that it is very likely that the same pace of adjustment will continue in the next decision, adding that higher increases should not be ruled out if the inflationary outlook deteriorates even further.",
        "He/she pointed out that it must be highlighted that the magnitude of the increases will depend on the latest information, especially regarding observed inflation and its expectations, as well as forward-looking inflation indicators, such as producer prices and international price benchmarks for commodities.",
        "He/she emphasized that in order to avoid higher costs in the future, the commitment to the constitutional mandate must be strengthened until the inflation trend has moved past its inflection point, inflation expectations have stabilized, and inflation forecasts are no longer revised upwards.",
        "One member stated that, in line with the monetary policy regime, the stance should be adjusted so that the central bank inflation forecast reflects a more neutral and symmetric balance of risks.",
        "He/she stated that during this hiking cycle, Banco de México has acted in a committed manner, with timely and gradual increases in the reference rate, as well as robust and forceful hikes when conditions have so required.",
        "He/she argued that a restrictive monetary stance has already been achieved.",
        "He/she added that, although medium- and long-term inflation expectations have started to stabilize, they are still at high levels and within them they exhibit a bimodal distribution between 3.5 and 4%, which represents a significant challenge for monetary policy.",
        "He/she considered it necessary to maintain such expectations anchored.",
        "He/she pointed out that by increasing the pace of adjustments of the monetary policy rate, the ex-ante real interest rate was raised beyond the range estimated as neutral.",
        "He/she noted that an increase of 75 basis points would strengthen the absolute monetary stance and ensure that the nominal interest rate lies above the level of observed inflation, which is a necessary condition to achieve its convergence to the target.",
        "He/she emphasized that the nominal interest rate would also be above the expected levels of inflation within the forecast horizon, which is consistent with a downward trajectory of inflation.",
        "Regarding the relative monetary stance, he/she stated that inflation expectations in the United States have declined faster than in Mexico, and thus the ex-ante real interest rate spread between both countries has narrowed.",
        "He/she highlighted that the greater monetary tightening in the United States and the intensification of geopolitical tensions led to an increase in risk aversion and to greater volatility.",
        "He/she argued that the proposed interest rate increase would provide certainty that markets and the financial system will adjust in an orderly manner and avoid affecting the economy's price formation process.",
        "He/she stated that, looking ahead, each decision must be carefully calibrated, determining the appropriate monetary stance to guarantee price stability and ensure the convergence of inflation to the target.",
        "He/she underlined that all available information must be considered when determining the monetary policy stance.",
        "The Governing Board evaluated the magnitude and diversity of the shocks that have affected inflation and its determinants, along with the evolution of medium- and long-term inflation expectations and the price formation process.",
        "It also considered the increasing challenges for monetary policy stemming from the ongoing tightening of global financial conditions, the environment of significant uncertainty, the inflationary pressures accumulated as a result of the pandemic and the geopolitical conflict, as well as the possibility of greater effects on inflation.",
        "Based on these considerations, and with the presence of all its members, it decided unanimously to raise the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 75 basis points to 9.25%.",
        "With this action, the monetary policy stance adjusts to the trajectory required for inflation to converge to its 3% target within the forecast horizon.",
        "The Board will thoroughly monitor inflationary pressures as well as all factors that have an incidence on the foreseen path for inflation and its expectations.",
        "This, in order to set a policy rate that is consistent at all times, with both the orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to the policy operates as well as with an adequate adjustment of the economy and financial markets.",
        "The Board will assess the magnitude of the upward adjustments in the reference rate for its next policy decisions based on the prevailing conditions.",
        "Victoria Rodríguez, Galia Borja, Irene Espinosa, Gerardo Esquivel and Jonathan Heath voted in favor of increasing the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 75 basis points to 9.25%.",
        "The main reason behind my dissenting opinion regarding the monetary policy statement is that, in view of the deteriorating outlook for inflation and financial conditions, the significant correction in our inflation forecasts, and a balance of risks biased significantly to the upside, I consider it appropriate to provide an explicit guide that allows an alignment of expectations on the future path of the reference rate within the horizon in which monetary policy operates.",
        "As I have mentioned on previous occasions, communication is a key aspect of monetary policy.",
        "Following this premise, I believe that, in addition to mentioning that the reference rate will continue to be adjusted upwards, and that the magnitude of said adjustments will be evaluated by the Governing Board based on the conditions prevailing at the time each policy decision is made, on this ocassion, the monetary policy statement should mention explicitly and clearly that, in order to converge to the 3% target, the monetary policy stance must remain restrictive during the entire forecast horizon.",
        "Although a high level of uncertainty prevails, providing a guide on the future stance of monetary policy is necessary to enable the formation of expectations consistent with inflation’s convergence to the target.",
        "Most members mentioned that a moderate recovery of the global economy is expected during the third quarter.",
        "They noted that this is partly due to the reopening of activities in China.",
        "Some members mentioned, as an additional factor, the rebound in the US economy.",
        "One member attributed this rebound to an increase in exports, and pointed out that domestic demand continued to decelerate.",
        "Nevertheless, most members highlighted the weakening of the European economies.",
        "Regarding labor markets, they stated that in advanced economies they continued showing strength.",

        "Most members noted that in certain economies headline inflation decreased.",
        "One member mentioned that in some countries the inflation peak may have already been observed.",
        "However, most members warned that world inflation remains high and above the central pressures on core inflation persist.",
        "In this regard, one member pointed out the divergence across regions.",
        "He/she noted that there are economies where domestic inflationary processes have remained isolated from global pressures, some others where inflation continues rising, and others where it has started to decline.",
        "He/she considered that, although the declines in headline inflation have not yet passed through to the core component, they are relevant, as the level of headline inflation matters for secondround effects and the persistence of the inflation index components.",
        "He/she added that producer price indices, which usually precede core inflation dynamics, have improved in various economies.",
        "He/she concluded that, looking ahead, lower inflationary pressures are expected.",
        "Some members stated that convergence towards the central banks’ targets is still anticipated to take place between the end of 2023 and 2024.",
        "Nevertheless, one member warned that upside risks and uncertainty about the future evolution of global inflation persist.",
        "Most members stated that a large number of central banks continued raising their reference rates, some of them in a smaller-than-expected magnitude.",

        "Some members noted that certain central banks continued making large adjustments to their interest rates.",
        "Some members pointed out that certain Latin American central banks announced the end of their hiking cycles or are expected to reach it soon.",
        "In this context, one member reflected on the assessment of risks that central banks are facing: on the one hand, the risk of prematurely halting the tightening process, causing inflation to become more entrenched and more difficult to fight against, and, on the other hand, the risk that an excessive tightening will significantly affect economic activity or generate financial instability.",
        "Most members mentioned that reference rates are expected to remain elevated Regarding the Federal Reserve, all members stated that, in its most recent decision, it raised the federal funds rate by 75 basis points.",
        "Most members considered that said institution could slow down its pace of adjustments in the near future.",
        "Some members stated that it announced that future increases will depend on the accumulated monetary tightening, the lags through which monetary policy operates, and on the evolution of the economy and financial markets.",

        "Another member pointed out that, in his/her opinion, there are no widespread wagerelated pressures, and that they are rather circumscribed and reflect the heterogeneous economic recovery.",
        "He/she considered that, so far, no wage-price spiral is observed, given that, contrary to historical records, growth of real wages has currently been lower than price increases.",
        "He/she pointed out that some studies of international institutions suggest that wage-price dynamics, such as the currently observed, have not necessarily led to a wage-price spiral, but rather to the recovery of real wages once inflation starts to decline.",
        "He/she added that the largest wage increases are currently observed in sectors where salaries are more linked to the minimum wage, therefore said increments correspond to factors unrelated to the formation of inflation expectations.",
        "He/she concluded that, although there is no conclusive evidence that this type of pressures are being faced, it is important to continue monitoring the dynamics between inflation and wages.",
        "Regarding risks to the downside, one member mentioned the lower inflationary pressures that could derive from a greater-than-anticipated deceleration of the global economy and from the resolution of disruptions in production and distribution chains.",
        "Most members pointed out that the balance of risks for the foreseen inflation trajectory remains biased to the upside.",
        "One member mentioned that the balance remains considerably biased to the upside, as no change in trend has occurred.",

        "Most members highlighted that the Mexican peso has appreciated and showed more resilience than other currencies.",
        "They emphasized its orderly behavior in an uncertain and volatile international aversion.",
        "They pointed out that the resilience of the Mexican peso has been associated with the country’s sound macroeconomic fundamentals.",
        "Some members mentioned as additional factors the relatively high levels of the volatility-adjusted interest rate spread between Mexico and the United States.",
        "One member stated that this spread reflects the monetary policy actions implemented by Banco de México.",
        "He/she added that the above does not mean that there is a target for the exchange rate level.",
        "He/she pointed out that an economy with free capital mobility cannot simultaneously have an exchange rate target and an independent monetary policy.",
        "He/she emphasized that, by following a monetary policy focused on price stability, operating under a flexible exchange rate regime, the exchange rate must continue to work as a shock absorber for the economy.",
        "Most members pointed out that short-term interest rates of government bonds increased, while medium- and long-term rates registered limited adjustments.",
        "One member stated that the short-term increases respond to the reference rate’s hiking cycle, while medium- and long-term rates showed some volatility, in line with the dynamics of rates at the global level.",
        "Another member mentioned that the yield curve of real interest rate instruments registered significant increases, especially for shortterm nodes.",
        "He/she highlighted that Mexico’s financial conditions index continues reflecting tightness, due to persistent pressures in the debt market, sovereign risk, inflation, and economic growth.",
        "One member added that default risk premia decreased, in contrast to what was observed in other emerging economies.",
        "Some members highlighted the stock market gains, generated by the positive quarterly data reported by firms.",
        "Regarding commercial bank credit to firms, one member pointed out that it continued recovering gradually during the third quarter, with an improvement in firms’ demand, although lending conditions remained tight.",
        "He/she added that consumer credit continues with a positive trend in real terms, although a slower pace is anticipated in view of the foreseen economic slowdown.",
        "He/she underlined that banks’ loan delinquency rates have been declining.",
        "The Governing Board evaluated the magnitude and diversity of the shocks that have affected inflation and its determinants, along with the evolution of medium- and long-term inflation expectations and the price formation process.",
        "It also considered the increasing challenges for monetary policy stemming from the ongoing tightening of global financial conditions, the inflationary pressures accumulated as a result of the pandemic and the geopolitical conflict, the possibility of greater effects on inflation, and the monetary policy stance already attained in this hiking cycle.",
        "Based on these considerations, the Governing Board decided by majority to raise the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 75 basis points to 10.00%.",
        "The Governing Board members added that, with this action, the monetary policy stance adjusts to the trajectory required for inflation to converge to its 3% target The Board will thoroughly monitor inflationary pressures as well as all factors that have an incidence on the foreseen path for inflation and its expectations.",
        "This, in order to set a policy rate that is consistent at all times with both the orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to the 3% target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates as well as with an adequate adjustment of the economy and financial markets.",
        "In its next meetings, the Board will assess the magnitude of upward adjustments to the reference rate based on the prevailing One member stated that, since the last monetary policy meeting, the Mexican economy has continued facing a complex and uncertain environment, characterized by deep, generalized, and persistent inflationary pressures, as well as by tight monetary and financial conditions at the global level.",
        "He/she highlighted that, given the deep and persistent inflationary shocks, a tight monetary policy stance is required in order to contain inflation and to help it begin decreasing towards the central bank’s target.",
        "He/she pointed out that, in terms of the absolute monetary policy stance, a 75 basis-point increase in the reference rate would allow the ex-ante real interest rate to reach a level that is unequivocally in restrictive territory.",
        "He/she noted that it would send a clear message regarding the central bank’s commitment to fulfill its primary mandate of price stability.",
        "He/she added that, since core inflation has not started to decrease yet and the balance of risks for inflation is biased to the upside, monetary policy needs to be tightened further than it already has been.",
        "In terms of the relative monetary policy stance, he/she pointed out that a 75 basis-point increase would maintain the reference rate spread between Mexico and the United States at 600 basis points.",
        "In this regard, he/she stated that Mexico is a small and open economy with a high level of financial and commercial integration with the United States and, therefore, it is normal for the Federal Reserve’s actions to have repercussions on the Mexican economy.",
        "In this regard, he/she stated that the central bank conducts its monetary policy considering all inflation determinants and its expectations, including the actions taken by the Federal Reserve.",
        "He/she argued that both Mexico and the United States face significant inflationary pressures and are undergoing a cycle of monetary tightening, which does not imply that Banco de México mechanically follows the steps taken by the Federal Reserve.",
        "He/she considered that, although increases in long-term inflation expectations have been moderate, it is important to monitor that these do not continue being revised upwards, as it would make it difficult to achieve the primary mandate.",
        "Looking ahead, he/she considered that it would be important to further increase the reference rate in order to maintain inflation expectations anchored and to enable the reduction of inflation to its target.",
        "He/she added that the magnitude of future upward adjustments to the reference rate will depend on the prevailing economic conditions, considering the increases that have already been implemented in this hiking cycle and that the monetary policy stance is already in restrictive territory.",
        "Another member stated that the upward trend in the core sub-index and the increasing pressures it faces make the monetary policy outlook more complex.",
        "He/she mentioned that, despite the significant adjustments in the monetary policy stance, no inflection point has been observed in the inflation trend yet.",
        "He/she argued that, on the one hand, there are high and persistent inflation levels with a balance of risks biased to the upside, and, on the other hand, economic activity registers more dynamism than expected, with an output gap that continues narrowing.",
        "He/she added that inflationary pressures related to the labor market are observed as well.",
        "He/she underlined that all of the above occurs in an international context that has become significantly more adverse.",
        "With regard to the deterioration of inflation expectations, he/she expressed concern that they are above the inflation target, given that this can pose risks to Banco de México’s credibility.",
        "He/she considered that it is essential to communicate that the reference rate will continue increasing and that the magnitude of the upward adjustments will be determined based on available information, in order to achieve the convergence of inflation to its target.",
        "He/she stated that this would not limit the room for maneuver in the next monetary policy decisions, and could contribute to monetary policy effectiveness and, therefore, to minimize the disinflationary adjustment costs.",
        "He/she argued that sending a timely, clear and forceful signal is the only path to reducing the risk of an unanchoring of inflation expectations and to prevent the inertia of the inflationary process from becoming entrenched.",
        "He/she cautioned that, if this type of scenario were to materialize, it would be extremely costly in the medium and long terms.",
        "He/she expressed that all of the above more than ever requires adherence to the primary mandate and doing what is needed to enable the convergence of inflation to its target in the foreseen time frame, and to mitigate the deterioration of the price formation process and the upward revisions in expectations.",
        "He/she added that easing the conditions will not be possible until inflation starts to follow a clear and sustained downward trajectory and expectations return to levels close to the 3% target.",
        "He/she highlighted that, based on available information, it will be necessary to maintain a restrictive monetary policy stance throughout the planning horizon, which, in his/her opinion, should be communicated explicitly.",
        "One member considered it important to reduce the pace of upward adjustments given the balance of risks associated with monetary policy decisions, and to signal that the terminal interest rate level may soon be reached.",
        "He/she estimated that the recently observed strength of the Mexican peso provides an opportunity to do so.",
        "He/she expressed that, on the one hand, there is a risk that the implemented monetary tightening is insufficient, which would lead to a more persistent inflationary process that would be costly to revert, and, on the other hand, there is a risk of implementing an excessive tightening, which would affect financial and macroeconomic stability.",
        "He/she added that a high financial cost can affect firms, financial institutions and governments with high leverage, and would deteriorate the economic and employment growth outlook, which could increase risk premia.",
        "In this regard, he/she noted that different institutions have warned about the risks associated with an excessive tightening of global financial conditions.",
        "He/she cautioned that, considering the increases that have been implemented, the risk of an excessive tightening has increased, given that: i) the ex-ante real interest rate, at 4%, is in a clearly restrictive territory; and ii) if an ex-ante real interest rate between 5 and 5.5% were to be attained, it would be well above the estimated neutral interest rate, which would affect consumption, investment and credit.",
        "In contrast, he/she considered that the risk of an insufficient tightening has diminished, as a result of the reduction in different inflationary pressures worldwide, the recent decrease in producer price inflation, and the interest rate increases implemented during this cycle.",
        "He/she argued that, considering the described disjunctive, although the hiking cycle has to continue, it is necessary to reduce the pace of adjustment, calibrate adequately the next policy decisions, and lower the probability of the described risks materializing.",
        "He/she added that, even if the pace of upward adjustments is reduced, it could be possible to shorten or lengthen the cycle, if necessary.",
        "However, in his/her opinion, maintaining the current pace would considerably increase the risk of an excessive tightening, with a final interest rate that would be too high.",
        "He/she added that this decision would signal that the end of the cycle is still distant, which could negatively affect inflation expectations.",
        "He/she stated that monetary policy operates with a lag, and thus its effects will be more evident over the following months.",
        "Therefore, he/she considered that the upward cycle should end even before a significant reduction in inflation is observed.",
        "He/she argued that, to the extent that the central bank communicates that the policy stance is now restrictive enough, inflation expectations should begin to decrease, leading to additional increases in the exante real interest rate and to a greater tightening of financial conditions.",
        "Another member considered it necessary to continue consolidating a restrictive monetary policy, at the same rate as in the previous decision, in view of: i) the upward trend in core inflation; ii) the deterioration of inflation expectations; iii) a balance of risks for inflation that is considerably biased to the upside; and iv) an inflation forecast that anticipates a distant convergence to the target.",
        "He/she argued that reducing the pace of upward adjustments should only be considered if the inflationary outlook improves, specifically for its core component.",
        "He/she mentioned that the economy’s cyclical conditions do not justify relaxing the efforts to control inflation.",
        "He/she considered the deterioration of inflation expectations worrying, given that it suggests their possible unanchoring, which would weaken the main mechanism of monetary policy transmission.",
        "He/she stated that further increases in inflation expectations require greater efforts in adjusting the ex-ante real interest rate.",
        "He/she mentioned that a level of 6% or higher for said interest rate would be desirable as its final level, conditional on the evolution of data, particularly long-term inflation expectations.",
        "He/she pointed out that, to determine the final interest rate, previous monetary cycles should not be taken as a reference, as the inflation level is currently higher and its dynamics are more complex.",
        "He/she mentioned that the final interest rate should be determined with caution, as it could be the reference that would prevail over a long period of time.",
        "He/she stated that the interest rate spread should be maintained at least at and thus the adjustments to the federal funds rate must continue to be the floor.",
        "He/she argued that this is a well-founded decision and not an automatic reaction.",
        "He/she highlighted that said spread is justified, not by the behavior of economic cycles of México and the United States, which do not coincide, but by the synchronization of the inflationary cycles across both countries, characterized by a significant upward trend of the core component.",
        "He/she added that it will only be possible to decouple from the Federal Reserve when the inflationary dynamics diverge or when there is certainty regarding the Federal Reserve’s final interest rate.",
        "He/she added that a high spread would help to address: i) the increasing external uncertainty; ii) the risk of recession; iii) the tightening of global financial conditions; iv) the risk of an idiosyncratic shock derived from trade negotiations with the United States; and v) external inflationary pressures, which have been mitigated by the favorable performance of the Mexican peso.",
        "He/she pointed out that the inflationary outlook reveals mixed signals, and for said reason it is important to have clarity as to how these will be incorporated in the reaction function and in the monetary cycle outlook.",
        "He/she added that the forward guidance should be as explicit as possible, and should be carefully communicated and emphasize that this does not imply a commitment.",
        "He/she stated that, considering the available information, it should be communicated that the upward cycle has not ended yet, although there is the possibility of reducing the pace of adjustment.",
        "He/she warned that when the interest rate reaches its final point, it will remain at that level for some time, until inflation begins following a clear downward trend and the balance of risks improves.",
        "He/she pointed out that communicating this forward guidance message decisively would reinforce the central bank’s credibility.",
        "One member considered it necessary to continue tightening monetary policy for the following reasons: i) headline inflation remains high and its convergence to the target poses significant challenges; ii) core inflation maintains an upward trend and must be contained to allow headline inflation to converge to its target; iii) inflation expectations have continued to deteriorate, which has made it difficult for the real interest rate to increase proportionally to the implemented nominal interest rate adjustments; and iv) it is necessary to consolidate a more equilibrated balance of risks for inflation.",
        "He/she mentioned that a process from becoming entrenched and from affecting the price formation process in the medium term.",
        "In this regard, he/she noted that the recent increases in the reference rate have been greater than those observed in previous upward cycles, in both nominal and real terms.",
        "He/she indicated that, despite the shocks that have been observed, this has allowed the ex-ante real interest rate to achieve clearly restrictive levels and the nominal rate to reach levels above both observed and expected inflation, which will contribute to the process of convergence of inflation.",
        "He/she added that monetary conditions that affect the Mexican economy via the real interest rate and the real exchange rate overall show greater astringency as compared to other similar economies, which would also suggest that the monetary policy stance is consistent with the convergence of inflation to its target.",
        "As to the relative monetary policy stance, he/she underlined that a synchronization of the monetary cycles between Mexico and the United States is conditional to the type of shocks being confronted, and thus is not mechanical, nor and end in and of itself.",
        "Looking ahead, he/she considered it important to monitor the evolution of the cyclical conditions of both economies.",
        "As for the next monetary policy decisions, he/she sustained that, given the high uncertainty regarding the inflationary shocks, it is necessary to maintain the required flexibility in each decision.",
        "Therefore, he/she argued that, at this moment, rather than providing a specific guide about the terminal level of the rate, a monetary policy stance that is consistent with a decrease in inflationary pressures, with an improvement in inflation expectations, and with inflation’s convergence, must be consolidated.",
        "He/she pointed out that these elements will be key to determine the adequate absolute, and consequently, relative, monetary policy stances.",
        "The Governing Board evaluated the magnitude and diversity of the shocks that have affected inflation and its determinants, along with the evolution of mediumand long-term inflation expectations and the price formation process.",
        "It also considered the increasing challenges for monetary policy stemming from the ongoing tightening of global financial conditions, the environment of significant uncertainty, the inflationary pressures accumulated as a result of the pandemic and the geopolitical conflict, the possibility of greater effects on inflation, and the monetary policy stance already attained in this hiking cycle.",
        "Based on these considerations, the Board decided by majority to raise the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by monetary policy stance adjusts to the trajectory required for inflation to converge to its 3% target within the forecast horizon.",
        "The Board will thoroughly monitor inflationary pressures as well as all factors that have an incidence on the foreseen path for inflation and its expectations.",
        "This, in order to set a policy rate that is consistent at all times with both the orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to the 3% target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates as well as with an adequate adjustment of the economy and financial markets.",
        "In its next meetings, the Board will assess the magnitude of the upward adjustments to the reference rate based on the prevailing conditions.",
        "Victoria Rodríguez, Galia Borja, Irene Espinosa, and Jonathan Heath voted in favor of increasing the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 75 basis points to 10.00%.",
        "Gerardo Esquivel voted in favor of increasing the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 50 basis points to 9.75%.",
        "I consider it necessary to start reducing the pace of the hiking cycle.",
        "This would signal that we are nearing the cycle’s terminal rate and would also be consistent with the current balance of risks.",
        "We are facing two possible risks: an insufficient tightening (which could translate into persistent, costly-to-revert inflation) and an excessive tightening that would affect macroeconomic and financial stability.",
        "As the reference rate has been raised, the former risk has decreased, while the latter one has increased.",
        "The former, because external inflationary pressures have started to subside and because the ex-ante real interest rate already exceeds its neutral level considerably.",
        "It does not seem necessary to tighten much more.",
        "What is required is to allow the restrictive monetary policy stance that has been attained, and which works with a lagged effect, to continue operating.",
        "It is important to point out that the proposed increase would imply a decoupling from the Federal Reserve and a reduction of the interest rate spread with the United States.",
        "It is argued that, in order to prevent foreign exchange and financial instability, the abovementioned must be avoided.",
        "However, recently, the Mexican peso has appreciated significantly against the US dollar and other currencies.",
        "This represents an ideal opportunity to implement the referred adjustment with a minimal risk.",

        "He/she pointed out that back orders, delivery times and sea freight costs remain higher than they were prior to the pandemic.",
        "He/she added that, as control of the pandemic improves, supply restrictions will decline and inflationary pressures will ease, although he/she also acknowledged that said process will be gradual and is not exempt from facing interruptions.",
        "Some members noted that mobility indicators have recovered, particularly in emerging economies.",
        "One member mentioned the improvement in indicators related to manufacturing and services purchases, which points to a lower intensity and duration of the effects caused by the Omicron variant, compared with previous waves of contagion.",
        "Most members pointed out that the Russia- Ukraine conflict has generated an environment of deterioration in the outlook for growth at a global level.",
        "One member mentioned that, measured through the foreign trade flows of these economies, their direct ties and the destination of their products, the impact could concentrate mostly in Eastern Europe and euro area countries, as well as in China, although he/she considered that, given the importance of the economies involved, as suppliers of metals and commodities and as producers of fertilizers, global economic activity could be affected.",
        "Some members stated that the economic sanctions imposed on Russia could affect financial markets, international trade, and supply chains.",

        "He/she added that commodity prices have surpassed those registered during the pandemic and other stress episodes.",
        "However, some members noted that said increases have partially reversed recently.",
        "One member added that, in the future, the conflict could lead to a reconfiguration of global value chains, with ensuing cost-related pressures.",

        "On the downside: i) a greater-than-expected persistence of the pandemic; ii) prolongation or intensification of bottleneck problems in supply chains, or higher costs of inputs and production in various sectors of the economy; iii) additional episodes of volatility in international financial markets; and iv) lower-thanexpected or insufficient investment to support economic recovery and long-term growth.",
        "On the upside, he/she highlighted: i) a greater control of the pandemic; ii) that national and international stimuli continue to support consumption and investment; iii) Mexico being an attractive destination for investment in view of a reconfiguration of global production processes within the framework of the USMCA; and iv) the maintenance of global financial conditions to enable a faster economic recovery.",
        "He/she highlighted that some of the downside risks have been accentuated by the conflict in Eastern Europe.",
        "Some members mentioned that the balance of risks for growth remains biased to the downside while one member stated that it has deteriorated at the margin.",
        "Most members mentioned that during the first fortnight of March, headline and core inflation registered annual variations of 7.29 and 6.68%, respectively.",
        "Some members noted that this was attributed to the performance of the core component, which was partially offset by a marginal reduction in the non-core component.",
        "One member noted that, after two consecutive months in which monthly headline inflation was close to its historical average, it accelerated again in February.",
        "He/she added that the annual rate is far above its target.",
        "Some members expressed their concern about price dynamics, which have followed a marked upward trend for a long period.",
        "One member added that price growth is accelerating even faster than in 2017, which is most noticeable in the core component.",
        "Most members argued that inflation remains associated with the pandemic.",
        "One member pointed out that this has been reflected mainly in the merchandise component.",
        "Another member said that these effects are largely transmitted through tradable goods, including final goods, intermediate goods, and raw materials.",
        "He/she highlighted that the annual inflation of the National Producer Price Index (INPP, for its Spanish acronym) of intermediate inputs excluding oil reached a peak last December, that in February it continued declining, and that its current level is lower than the all-time high reached during the inflationary episode of 2017.",
        "One member highlighted that inflation is a generalized problem and that inflationary pressures are not only imported, but also domestic and are affecting non-tradable goods.",
        "He/she stated that domestic pressures are the result of idiosyncratic factors, such as public insecurity, adverse weather conditions, lack of specific inputs and wage pressures, in a context where there are doubts about the traditional estimations of the output gap and potential GDP.",
        "Another member noted that in Mexico food products have a higher weight in the CPI as compared to advanced and some emerging economies, and thus increases in food prices at the global level have generated a negative bias on Mexico’s inflation.",
        "He/she highlighted that, nevertheless, Mexico does not stand out for being the country with the highest levels of headline inflation among other countries that registered similar levels of inflation prior to the pandemic.",
        "One member pointed out that inflation of practically all CPI food items is growing at annual rates higher than 4% and around half of them are registering variations higher than 10%.",

        "He/she underlined that, during this period, convergence to the target was deferred from the second quarter of 2022 in December’s 2020 decision, to the first quarter of 2024 in the current decision.",
        "He/she warned that the systematic underestimation of inflation forecasts has generated an inflationary inertia that has already affected medium-term expectations and, if this continues, could lead to a de-anchoring of long-term expectations.",
        "One member noted that the factors associated with the pandemic are expected to continue having an influence on the inflation outlook worldwide.",
        "Another member mentioned that the current outlook is even more challenging as it is optimistic to believe that the effect of the accumulation of supply and demand shocks on inflation will dissipate immediately.",
        "He/she added that inflation will likely remain at high levels for a long period before decelerating.",

        "Another member mentioned that persistent supply and demand imbalances have also been due to production rigidities.",
        "He/she noted the risk of contractual wage revisions becoming contaminated given the high levels of observed and expected inflation, and in the presence of mechanical, aboveinflation wage revisions.",
        "He/she indicated that greater unforeseen adjustments to the reference rate in the United States could increase the risk of an exchange rate depreciation.",
        "One member considered that the risk of energy prices being subject to pressures is limited due to the domestic fuel price policy.",
        "He/she added that some estimates show that, even if the aforementioned policy is considered, increases in oil prices do not imply a deterioration in public finances.",
        "Among downside risks to inflation, another member included: i) a decline in the intensity of the military conflict; ii) that given the slack conditions, cost-related pressures and wage revisions do not exert pressure on prices; iii) that energy prices are lower than those anticipated; and iv) an exchange rate appreciation.",
        "One member noted that the decline in annual inflation of INPP intermediate inputs excluding oil could imply lower future pressures for core inflation.",
        "Most members stated that the balance of risks for the trajectory of inflation over the forecast horizon has deteriorated again and remains biased to the upside.",

        "He/she stated that, looking ahead, episodes of depreciation and high volatility in financial markets are not ruled out due to the environment of global uncertainty that persists.",
        "One member highlighted that consumer credit has recovered at a faster rate than during the 2008 crisis, while financing to firms has reactivated more slowly.",
        "Another member pointed out that credit to individuals with business activity decreased around first quarter of 2017.",
        "He/she added that credit to Small- and Medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) remains more than 10% below its pre-pandemic levels, including in those sectors that did not experience a recession, thus suggesting that the lack of credit can be partially attributed to the supply side.",
        "He/she said that as long as credit to businesses remains deteriorated, it will be very difficult to see a substantial improvement in private investment.",
        "One member pointed out that the lack of private investment is due to a deterioration in the business climate originated by external and idiosyncratic internal factors that were present way before the beginning of the tightening cycle, and therefore the weakness of investment can hardly be attributed to the adjustment of the monetary policy stance.",
        "Another member highlighted that during January resources due to a reduction in investment funds’ balances, while the strong demand for highly liquid instruments persisted.",
        "He/she added that markets have still not incorporated the risk of possible increases in the cost of corporate financing derived from the balance sheet reduction by the Federal Reserve.",
        "The Governing Board evaluated the magnitude and diversity of the shocks that have affected inflation and the factors that determine it, along with the risk of medium- and long-term inflation expectations and price formation becoming contaminated.",

        "However, he/she mentioned that, in Mexico, the current interest rate is relatively high, as little monetary stimulus was granted during 2020 and began to be withdrawn early in 2021.",
        "In this regard, he/she noted that it is not convenient to overreact to the expected rate increases in the United States.",
        "He/she highlighted that domestic inflation will decrease along with world inflation, as the number of infections decline, as vaccination coverage improves at a global level, and as monetary and fiscal policies in systemically important economies are adjusted.",
        "He/she added that inflationary risks stemming from the geopolitical conflict are limited due to Mexico’s fuel price policy.",
        "Given the aforementioned balance of risks, looking ahead, the policy response should be moderate and gradual, avoiding taking the reference rate to an excessively restrictive level.",
        "He/she pointed out that the interest rate levels anticipated by both private sector analysts and market traders are too high, considering the level of deviation of inflation from its target, and the slack conditions in Mexico relative to other economies.",
        "He/she warned that the Mexican economy shows weakness precisely where monetary policy has a direct influence, such as the deterioration of credit for productive purposes, the stagnation of investment, the lack of dynamism in construction, the fall in consumer credit, and the reduction in domestic sales of new automobiles.",
        "He/she stated that, in contrast, consumption of nondurables, which responds more to other determinants, has performed better.",
        "He/she added that continuing to raise the reference rate at an excessively elevated pace could affect the country's growth outlook, which would reduce its attractiveness to capital flows seeking high yields in emerging market equities.",
        "He/she warned that a recession would translate into macroeconomic and financial instability, exerting pressures on both risk premium and the exchange rate, which eventually could affect inflation.",
        "Another member mentioned that Mexico is one of the few economies with a positive ex-ante real interest rate close to its neutral level, which has maintained solid macroeconomic fundamentals, and still has a widely negative output gap.",
        "He/she stated that geopolitical tensions constitute a new source of uncertainty for the behavior of Mexico’s nominal, real and financial variables, and that their potential effects will depend on the duration and intensity of said tensions.",
        "He/she added that, up to now, the impact on economic activity is uncertain, while regarding inflation, the risks are several.",
        "He/she pointed out that inflation in Mexico continues being subject to pressures related mainly to the effects of the pandemic and whose global factors may continue to influence the inflation outlook.",
        "As a result, Banco de México's forecasts were significantly revised and convergence to the inflation target was also adjusted accordingly to the horizon in which monetary policy operates.",
        "He/she stated that the rapid increase in inflation could affect the anchoring of inflation expectations if sufficient measures are not implemented.",
        "He/she mentioned that the monetary policy stance must remain robust so that the balance of risks regarding the medium-term inflation forecast acquires a more neutral character.",
        "He/she added that under an inflation forecast targeting framework, it is fundamental to guarantee that long-term expectations remain anchored and that shorter-term expectations return to the target.",
        "Thus, looking ahead, if the ex-ante real interest rate needs to be above the range estimated as neutral, a balanced relative monetary policy stance must be maintained.",
        "He/she pointed out that commitment to the constitutional mandate requires monetary policy stance be such that it ensures convergence to the inflation target, maintaining a proper balance in light of the imminent cycle of upward adjustments in the United States, and also foster the proper functioning of the financial system and an orderly adjustment in markets.",
        "He/she considered that, looking ahead, Banco de México must continue monitoring the observed and expected determinants of inflation.",
        "One member stated that inflationary pressures continue increasing and their persistence is not expected to diminish for a long period.",
        "He/she noted that it is necessary to induce a downward trajectory of inflation towards its long-term target.",
        "He/she argued that, at least in the short term, it is necessary to respond to the Federal Reserve's cycle of interest rate increases with proportional ones in order not to relax the relative monetary policy stance, for which there is no room for maneuver.",
        "He/she also pointed out that Banco de México must remain attentive to any possible effects of the Federal Reserve's monetary tightening on financial markets, but without acting mechanically.",
        "He/she pointed out that a greater tightening than that of the Federal Reserve could be required when the outlook for domestic inflation so demands, but without introducing excessive monetary restriction.",
        "He/she stated that given the possibility of inflation reaching its peak in the next quarter and then begin declining, decisions should be taken cautiously.",
        "He/she argued that a balance should be sought when assessing inflation persistence, the cyclical conditions, and the Federal Reserve’s cycle of interest rate increases, keeping in mind inflation as the most important issue to tackle.",
        "He/she noted that the ex-ante real interest rate is still at the bottom of the neutral interest rate range, which implies that monetary policy must continue to be adjusted at the current pace until exiting the neutral stance and reaching one that is consistent with the current situation.",
        "He/she pointed out that inflation expectations and the price formation process have continued to deteriorate and that, without the expectations channel functioning properly, monetary policy’s transmission mechanisms will be limited.",
        "He/she added that the expectations channel should not be minimized by arguing that a rate increase only mitigates the effect of inflationary shocks of a certain nature.",
        "He/she argued that, instead, acting decisively should make expectations adjust downwards.",
        "Thus, understanding the causality of the expectations channel and the lag with which it operates is crucial to avoid narratives incompatible with its functioning.",
        "He/she also highlighted that the credit channel is the least effective in the Mexican economy due to the low levels of depth, inclusion, and competitiveness of the financial system, and the high levels of labor informality.",
        "He/she mentioned that being in favor of an insufficient monetary policy response, based on the possible negative effects on economic activity, could be counterproductive, as it would contribute to higher levels of inflation, which in turn could hinder economic growth.",
        "Therefore, he/she pointed out that sending distorted signals that might undermine the credibility regarding the central bank’s primary mandate should be avoided.",
        "He/she noted that, according to the latest Regional Economic Report, around 30% of business agents surveyed consider inflation as one of the main obstacles to growth.",
        "He/she stated that the fact that high inflation has a greater negative effect on low-income population should also be taken into consideration.",
        "Another member mentioned that the outlook for inflation has deteriorated in light of the geopolitical conflict, in addition to the negative implications of the pandemic.",
        "He/she warned about the risk of high and persistent inflation affecting the price formation process and inflation expectations, especially longerterm ones.",
        "He/she recalled that the expectations channel is one of the most important for monetary policy transmission in Mexico, and that being complacent in light of the observed levels of inflation could lead to their unanchoring, which would imply a high cost for society.",
        "He/she pointed out that monetary policy faces a greater dilemma because the recovery of economic activity is still incomplete.",
        "He/she mentioned that the fundamental role of monetary policy is to stop the inflationary inertia that has developed over the last year, and that it is therefore necessary to act in a timely and decisive manner.",
        "He/she argued that the desired effect on the real interest rate has not been achieved because forecasts have systematically underestimated inflation, leading to lower real interest rates than necessary.",
        "He/she stated that central banks that have acted more rapidly have been able to reduce their monetary stimulus more effectively.",
        "He/she added that it is necessary to analyze more extensively whether front loading the pace of adjustment of the reference rate would curb inflationary inertia more firmly, shorten the expected duration of the upward cycle, and achieve a final interest rate of lower magnitude.",
        "He/she noted that markets expect an elevated trajectory for the reference rate.",
        "He/she added that failure to act rapidly and decisively may imply having higher and longer-lasting real interest rates in the future, which would increase the cost in terms of domestic production and employment.",
        "He/she underlined that the action brought forward maintains consistency between communication about the primary objective and the actions that are being implemented, and that it seeks to strengthen medium- and long-term expectations.",
        "He/she considered that, given the balance of risks for inflation, the risk of a greater monetary tightening at a global level, and the possible impact of the current geopolitical conflict on markets, it may be necessary to modify the pace of adjustment of the reference rate, for which the Governing Board is prepared to make the appropriate decisions.",
        "One member mentioned that monetary policy faces an unprecedented environment, because in addition to the challenges to fulfill the primary mandate derived from the pandemic, which have not been fully resolved, there is a geopolitical conflict that has generated strong additional inflationary pressures and significantly higher levels of uncertainty.",
        "He/she argued that given the greater possibility of Mexico’s price formation process becoming contaminated, it is important to adjust the monetary policy stance to keep inflation expectations anchored.",
        "He/she warned that if the necessary measures are not taken, inflation expectations could be affected given the high levels of inflation that have been observed for an extended period, which could in turn jeopardize convergence to the inflation target.",
        "He/she pointed out that the global inflationary environment would also lead to tighter monetary conditions.",
        "He/she argued that given Mexico's high degree of financial and trade integration with the rest of the world and its exposure to various types of external shocks, it is necessary to maintain a solid macroeconomic stance at all times.",
        "He/she underlined that, within Banco de México's attributions, this implies procuring a low and stable inflation and safeguarding the financial system’s strength.",
        "He/she warned about the social and economic costs of current inflation, which affect the lower-income population to a greater extent.",
        "He/she considered it imperative that, given the aforementioned challenges, the monetary policy response be clearly consistent with the convergence of inflation to the target within the forecast horizon, and seek to maintain inflation expectations anchored.",
        "He/she highlighted that future decisions should consider the evolution of the different shocks that have exerted pressure on inflation throughout the economic recovery, after the initial shock of the pandemic, and of those associated with the conflict in Eastern Europe, so that Banco de México fulfills its constitutional mandate.",
        "The Governing Board evaluated the magnitude and diversity of the shocks that have affected inflation and the factors that determine it, along with the risk of medium- and long-term inflation expectations and price formation becoming contaminated.",

        "Most members stated that the balance of risks for the trajectory of inflation within the forecast horizon remains biased Regarding domestic financial markets, most members highlighted the resilience of the exchange rate, although it exhibited episodes of volatility.",
        "They highlighted that the resilience of the Mexican peso in relation to other currencies was partly due to the wide volatility-adjusted interest rate spread relative to the United States.",
        "One member noted that the Mexican peso stood out as the second-best performing currency during the period, only slightly behind the Brazilian real.",
        "Most members pointed out that short-term interest rates increased and longer-term ones decreased.",
        "One member mentioned that the flattening of yield curves was supported by inflows into Udibonos and marginally into M-Bonos.",

        "Another member added that the premia reflected by credit default swaps at different maturities shifted downwards.",

        "In this regard, one member pointed out that there are factors of domestic pressure that could increase the idiosyncratic risk premium.",
        "Some members noted that financing conditions for the private sector have improved at the margin.",
        "They highlighted that during the second quarter of 2022, domestic financing to firms continued moderating its rate of contraction in annual terms.",
        "They pointed out that commercial bank credit to firms continued recovering.",
        "They indicated that this occurred in a context of increased demand from firms and in spite of the tighter monetary conditions.",
        "One member noted that lending conditions for smaller firms have become less restrictive since the second half of firms were at levels similar to those observed prior to the pandemic and that delinquency rates continued to decrease.",
        "In contrast, he/she warned about the banks’ financing to firms, as compared to an expansion of 2.1% by commercial banks.",
        "Regarding household financing, another member mentioned that mortgage lending continued growing moderately at a real annual rate.",
        "He/she added that consumer credit continued increasing in real annual terms, mainly as a result of the sustained dynamism of payroll credit and the credit-card portfolio, as well as the recent recovery in the personal-loan portfolio.",

        "It monetary policy stemming from the ongoing tightening of global financial conditions, the environment of significant uncertainty, and inflationary pressures accumulated as a result of the pandemic and the geopolitical conflict, as well as the possibility of greater effects on inflation.",
        "Based on these considerations, all members voted to raise the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 75 basis points to 8.50%.",
        "They highlighted that, with this action, the monetary policy stance adjusts to the trajectory required for inflation to converge to its The Governing Board will thoroughly monitor inflationary pressures as well as all factors that have an incidence on the foreseen path for inflation and its expectations.",
        "This, in order to set a policy rate that is consistent at all times, with both the orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation within the time frame in which monetary policy operates as well as with an adequate adjustment of the economy and financial markets.",
        "The Board added that it will assess the magnitude of the upward adjustments in the reference rate for its next policy decisions One member stated that, like most economies, Mexico has faced a highly complex and uncertain environment due to the concurrence of shocks that have caused widespread and large-scale inflationary pressures.",
        "In this context, it has been imperative to focus on establishing a monetary policy stance conducive to an adequate adjustment of relative prices and domestic financial markets.",
        "He/she pointed out that Banco de México has acted timely and decisively considering: i) the negative impact that a prolonged period of inflation well above the target could have on longer-term inflation expectations; ii) the high social and economic costs derived from inflation; and iii) the risk of a disorderly behavior in financial markets, including the foreign exchange market.",
        "He/she recalled that, although from June 2021 to June 2022 the reference rate has been raised by 375 basis points, until early 2022, the impact on the ex-ante real interest rate had been partially offset by the increase in inflation expectations due to the additional and unexpected shocks that were observed.",
        "However, he/she estimated that, given the 75 basis points increase of the previous decision, an additional 75 basis points increase in the current decision would allow the exante real interest rate to be in restrictive territory.",
        "He/she considered that a smaller increase would be insufficient for the real interest rate to exceed the estimated range for the neutral interest rate.",
        "He/she highlighted that it is essential for Banco de México to act decisively in order to avoid a deterioration in the price formation process.",
        "He/she added that, given the complexity of the environment, characterized by tighter global financial conditions and high uncertainty, it is the central bank's responsibility to take the necessary measures to comply with its constitutional mandate, which increases the importance of decisively raising the reference rate in the present decision.",
        "He/she warned that in order to guarantee the convergence of inflation to its target, additional upward adjustments in the reference rate will be required, the magnitude of which must be assessed according to the available information.",
        "Another member stated that the inflationary landscape confirms that a process of unanchoring of inflation expectations is beginning to take place.",
        "He/she underlined that, in his/her opinion, it is evident that the adjustments implemented in the monetary policy stance have been insufficient to counteract the deterioration in the price formation process and the increase in inflation expectations, and therefore he/she considered it absolutely necessary to bring the real interest rate to restrictive territory.",
        "He/she pointed out that only through firm and decisive actions it will be possible to rebuild the confidence in the central bank's commitment to the convergence of inflation to the target within the forecast horizon.",
        "He/she added that the deterioration in the global economic environment, geopolitical conflicts, uncertainty about the reestablishment of supply chains, and the future path of world inflation, result in an even greater challenge for the conduction of monetary policy, and that the start of a period of elevated interest rates and economic weakness may be witnessed.",
        "He/she highlighted that in addition to figuring out the adequate pace of adjustment, the duration of the restrictive stance must also be defined.",
        "He/she considered that, currently, the main risk is the possibility of unforeseen changes in monetary policy in the United States.",
        "He/she argued that given the complex outlook, it is crucial to maintain a risk management approach, maintain the pace of monetary tightening, eliminate inflationary inertia, strengthen confidence and anchor inflation expectations at around 3%, as well as to promote an orderly adjustment of markets in light of tighter financial conditions.",
        "He/she added that the monetary policy statement should allow to anticipate more restrictive monetary conditions in the future.",
        "He/she pointed out that given the high uncertainty prevailing in the economic environment, such forward guidance should guarantee flexibility and reiterate that Banco de México will act decisively when required.",
        "He/she mentioned that the number of shocks the economy has faced, as well as their intensity and duration, have persistently accelerated inflationary dynamics.",
        "He/she warned that, in accordance with the central bank’s constitutional mandate, it is the Governing Board's duty to implement an active monetary policy that curbs the aforementioned inflationary dynamics and seeks the stability of prices and of inflation expectations around the target, thus strengthening monetary policy’s main transmission channels.",
        "One member stated that the proposed adjustment of the reference rate is appropriate for reasons of financial stability and to avoid second-round effects on the price formation process.",
        "He/she indicated that these effects occur in view of high and persistent inflation and consist of prices increasing simply because they rose yesterday and are expected to do so tomorrow.",
        "To avoid this, and considering the nature of the shocks, it is necessary to transit to a moderately restrictive monetary policy stance.",
        "However, he/she warned that an excessive tightening could imply a high cost in terms of employment, purchasing power, and economic activity, and even be counterproductive for macroeconomic and financial stability.",
        "He/she considered that since the consequences of the pandemic and the intensification of geopolitical conflicts are still being experienced, there is high uncertainty about the effect of the monetary adjustments on inflation and economic activity, however, there are signs that an unnecessarily high level of monetary tightening is soon to be reached.",
        "He/she mentioned that the variables most sensitive to the monetary policy stance, such as investment, construction, consumer durables sales and business credit, have remained weak since before the pandemic, and that further tightening could affect their performance even more.",
        "He/she added that the incipient deceleration of production in various sectors, of private consumption and of investment suggests that the monetary policy stance might have already started to have an impact on these variables.",
        "He/she stated that inflationary pressures stem mainly from external factors, and thus a moderation in domestic spending would not necessarily translate in an improvement in the country’s price formation process.",
        "He/she argued that, in the current environment, the use of monetary policy could be relatively inefficient.",
        "He/she mentioned that there are signs that global pressures have started to ease, and therefore inflation in Mexico might decline regardless of the monetary policy stance.",
        "He/she indicated that avoiding an excessively restrictive monetary policy would imply the possibility of decoupling from the pace of the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes relatively soon.",
        "He/she expressed that this is feasible since: i) the volatility-adjusted interest rate spread relative to the United States is one of the highest among emerging economies; ii) the Mexican peso stands out for its good performance and low volatility; iii) the Federal Reserve's policy stance is an important factor to consider, but Mexico’s monetary policy stance should rely more on the evolution of domestic variables and on the absolute policy stance; iv) Mexico started the hiking cycle earlier, and with a 75-basis point increase the policy stance would be situated in restrictive territory; v) unlike the United States, Mexico does not seem to face inflationary pressures from demand or the labor market; and vi) inflation in Mexico is closer to its target than the United States and other countries.",
        "For said reasons, he/she stated that there is room for a less restrictive monetary policy than in other emerging countries.",
        "Another member considered that, given the inflationary outlook, the hiking cycle must continue and a restrictive policy stance must be consolidated to contain inflation in the short-term and have a policy stance consistent with a downward path of inflation, even if this occurs in the medium term.",
        "He/she added that adjustments in the policy rate will not eliminate global pressures, but will help to avoid second-round effects.",
        "He/she pointed out that there are also domestic pressures.",
        "He/she indicated that there are no clear signs of deceleration, and that a lower slack allows for a more restrictive monetary policy stance.",
        "He/she stated that in view of the continuous deterioration of observed inflation and its expectations, during this hiking cycle it has been necessary to increase the pace of tightening two times.",
        "Even so, the ex-ante real interest rate remained in expansionary territory for almost a year, and after the last decision it finally reached a neutral stance.",
        "He/she estimated that an increase of 75 basis points would allow to barely reach a restrictive level, so there should be no concern that the real interest rate is too high or harmful for economic activity.",
        "He/she highlighted that cyclical conditions become less important, until inflation is under control.",
        "He/she stated that an interest rate increase lower than that of the Federal Reserve is not feasible because: i) the interest rate spread of 600 basis points relative to the United States has been sufficient to enable a good performance of the Mexican peso under episodes of volatility and a generalized appreciation of the dollar, and maintaining a relative policy stance would contribute to avoid episodes of exchange rate volatility; ii) there is still a sentiment of global risk aversion; and iii) there are idiosyncratic factors that could increase the risk premium.",
        "He/she pointed out that a change of direction in the monetary cycle remains distant since: i) there is no guarantee that the inflationary cycle has reached a peak; ii) even if it is reached, the reference rate cannot be lowered too early without being sure that inflation is clearly trending downwards; and iii) the deterioration of inflation expectations, especially long-term ones, might suggest the presence of negative effects on the price formation process.",
        "He/she stated that it is crucial to provide guidance on the path of the policy rate, to communicate explicitly that the hiking cycle is not over yet, to emphasize that the central bank will act decisively as needed, and that the Governing Board will monitor the evolution of the inflationary outlook and the external monetary conditions to determine whether the pace of increases in the reference rate will be maintained or if there is a space that can be used to ameliorate this pace.",
        "He/she stated that the central bank’s reaction function must be communicated with a clear and explicit forward guidance.",
        "For this purpose, the qualitative references about the future actions that have been made in previous communications must be complemented.",
        "He/she mentioned that the favorable reception of these changes by the public suggests that communication with forward guidance in which the path of the reference rate consistent with the inflation forecast is published should be analyzed.",
        "With such an addition, there would be greater certainty about the outlook for the current hiking cycle in order to counterbalance the uncertainty in the inflationary scenario.",
        "He/she indicated that this exercise of transparency and accountability would reinforce the credibility on the central bank's commitment to its mandate.",
        "One member highlighted that the international monetary conditions showed greater tightness and that geopolitical tensions increased and are an important source of uncertainty and volatility.",
        "He/she added that inflation continued increasing and that its expectations are still affected.",
        "He/she argued that an increase of 75 basis points in this decision would strengthen the absolute monetary policy stance in two dimensions: i) the ex-ante real interest rate would exceed the upper threshold of the estimated range for the neutral rate, which, in his/her opinion, is a key element for the monetary policy stance to be effective and decisively support the process of inflation convergence to its target.",
        "He/she also added that it would allow to send a clear signal so that inflation expectations remain anchored and return to their previous levels; and ii) the nominal interest rate would reach the level of headline inflation and exceed that of core inflation, a circumstance that has been observed in other monetary cycles before achieving inflation convergence.",
        "He/she added that, at the global level, during the current monetary cycle, this situation has been observed in very few economies.",
        "He/she mentioned that, as for the relative monetary policy stance, the interest rate spread relative to the United States is above both its historical average and the average observed during previous hiking cycles.",
        "He/she argued that there are two elements that indicate that the current relative monetary policy stance is competitive: i) when the interest rate spread relative to the United States is measured through ex-ante real interest rates, a much more solid policy stance in terms of level, speed and celerity can be noted, highlighting that said soundness has even been transmitted along the yield curve, where medium and long-term interest rate spreads are at high levels; and ii) since Mexico is an economy that complements its sources of financing with foreign savings, it is important to note that the interest rate spread has been complemented by favorable expectations on the performance of the Mexican peso with respect to other emerging economies' currencies, even when such indicators are adjusted for volatility.",
        "He/she argued that the current environment of high uncertainty worldwide, with domestic inflation at high levels, and with the policy stance that would be achieved with the proposed increase, would require, in the future, to carefully assess the available space so that the next decisions are consistent with the convergence of inflation to the target as well as with an orderly adjustment of the economy and financial markets, prioritizing the safeguarding of the central bank’s credibility.",
        "The Governing Board evaluated the magnitude and diversity of the shocks that have affected inflation and its determinants, along with the evolution of medium- and long-term inflation expectations and the price formation process.",
        "It also considered the increasing challenges for monetary policy stemming from the ongoing tightening of global financial conditions, the environment of significant uncertainty, and inflationary pressures accumulated as a result of the pandemic and the geopolitical conflict, as well as the possibility of greater effects on inflation.",
        "Based on these considerations, and with the presence of all its members, the Board decided unanimously to raise the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 75 basis points to 8.50%.",
        "With this action, the monetary policy stance adjusts to the trajectory required for inflation to converge to its 3% target within the forecast horizon.",
        "The Board will thoroughly monitor inflationary pressures as well as all factors that have an incidence on the foreseen path for inflation and its expectations.",
        "This, in order to set a policy rate that is consistent at all times, with both the orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to the policy operates as well as with an adequate adjustment of the economy and financial markets.",
        "The Board will assess the magnitude of the upward adjustments in the reference rate for its next policy decisions based on the prevailing conditions.",
        "Victoria Rodríguez, Galia Borja, Irene Espinosa, Gerardo Esquivel, and Jonathan Heath voted in favor of increasing the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 75 basis points to 8.50%.",
        "information shows that world economic growth has increased moderately during the fourth depending on the evolution of the pandemic and the actions implemented by their public health, monetary and fiscal authorities.",
        "In particular, the new variant of the virus and the adoption of mobility restrictions, mainly in Europe, were highlighted.",
        "Some members pointed out that supply constraints continue to affect industrial production and noted that global employment has not been able to return to its pre-pandemic levels.",
        "One member stated that this is due to an incomplete recovery in demand.",
        "Some members indicated that the weakness in employment is also due to individuals’ labor supply decisions in light of health risks.",
        "One member stated that the pandemic led to the early exit of older generations from the labor force and a lower participation of women and young people.",
        "He/she added that there has been a change in relative wages, associated to the risks of contagion, and to wage-related pressures, which has worsened as a result of the recent inflation dynamics.",
        "Some members mentioned that forecasts for 2022 remained stable, although they continue to be subject to a high degree of uncertainty.",
        "One member highlighted that the evolution of the pandemic and its new variants continues being the greatest risk factor for the global economic recovery.",
        "Another member pointed out the effects that the pandemic has had on the global economy: i) the shutdown of various sectors of productive activity; ii) the adoption of substantial spending stimuli in advanced economies; iii) a reallocation of spending; and iv) profound effects on the labor market.",
        "He/she stated that this series of unprecedented shocks has led to considerable forecast errors for economic activity and inflation.",
        "He/she highlighted that in 2021 fiscal support and transfers to households increased considerably in the United States, generating an increase in the demand for consumer durables worldwide, thus exerting pressure on their prices and generating bottlenecks.",
        "He/she also highlighted the rigidity and lack of resilience in supply chains.",
        "All members mentioned that world inflation originated by bottlenecks in production, the reallocation of spending towards merchandise, the elevated food and energy prices, and the recovery of some services.",
        "In the case of emerging economies, most members pointed out the impact of exchange rate depreciation on price increases.",
        "One member stated that the increase in inflationary pressures has coincided with the decline in the number of infections and the subsequent increase in mobility and spending.",
        "Some stressed that producer prices have been subject to significant pressures.",
        "One member pointed out that consumer durables have also been subject to pressures, registering an annual change of 14.9% in November of the previous year, when it registered -0.6%.",
        "He/she stated that inflation has been heterogeneous in advanced economies, highlighting the case of the United States, where it has been associated with its greater spending support programs.",
        "He/she detailed that, in this country, the annual variation of the personal consumption expenditure price deflator in October and that of the consumer price index in November, registered their highest values in 31 and nevertheless, that the latest data related to the manufacturing sector's purchasing managers' index, such as outstanding orders, delivery times, and sea freight rates, have shown an improvement at the margin.",
        "Some members pointed out that inflation dynamics have affected inflation expectations in the main advanced economies.",
        "One member said that inflationary pressures could last longer than expected, given that headline and core inflation have been above their central banks' targets for several consecutive months.",
        "He/she stated that in the main advanced economies, expectations for the next 12 months have reached historic highs, although longterm expectations have remained stable.",
        "Another member stated that in the United States, short- and medium-term inflation expectations of businessmen, consumers, and those implicit in fixed-income markets have increased.",
        "One member mentioned that inflation in that country will remain high during continue in emerging economies as well.",
        "Another member pointed out that the forecasts of central banks and international organizations anticipate a significant decline in inflation during the second half of 2022.",
        "He/she pointed out that commodity prices decreased in the last month, particularly those of basic energy commodities.",
        "He/she stated that as the sanitary problem continues to be resolved and uncertainty lessens, supply restrictions and price pressures will begin to ease.",
        "One member considered that this environment poses considerable challenges for inflation in the face of: i) disruptions and lack of flexibility in the supply of multiple products; ii) the concentration of spending on consumption of goods; iii) transfers to households; and iv) the increase in financial savings that may sustain high spending patterns going forward.",
        "He/she added that this makes it more complex to anticipate the duration of pressures on global inflation.",
        "He/she expressed that the risks for price formation at a global level, and their possible influence on our country, are considerable and rising.",
        "He/she highlighted that Mexico has one of the largest gaps in headline and core inflation among emerging economies.",
        "All members stated that the Federal Reserve announced an acceleration of the removal of monetary stimulus, doubling the pace of reduction of its net asset purchases.",
        "One member mentioned that this purchase program is expected to end in March 2022.",
        "All members noted that FOMC's projections for the federal funds rate point to larger increases than previously incorporate up to three increases by 2022.",
        "Some members noted the Fed's change in discourse towards a more restrictive policy stance, as it no longer considers the increase in inflation to be a transitory phenomenon.",
        "One member added that the Fed pointed out that supply-related issues and the reopening of the economy have exerted pressure on prices.",
        "Another member mentioned that it is still expected that a negative real interest rate will be maintained until 2024.",
        "He/she noted that the Fed's gradual and clear communication has avoided abrupt fluctuations in financial markets, and that it has been careful not to withdraw its monetary stimulus prematurely.",
        "The majority agreed that at a global level central banks are expected to adopt progressively less accommodative policy stances.",
        "One member added that while most central banks maintain an accommodative stance, their narrative has started to become more restrictive.",
        "Another member mentioned that a large number of emerging economies have accelerated their interest rate raising cycles.",
        "One member detailed, however, that the vast majority continue providing significant stimulus despite headline inflation being above their targets.",
        "He/she highlighted the cases of Chile, Colombia, Peru, Hungary, and Poland.",
        "Another member reflected upon the fact that, while advanced economies, which for many years have had inflation and its expectations below their targets, have more room for maneuver, in emerging economies, particularly in Mexico, price formation can be more easily contaminated.",
        "He/she emphasized that emerging economies face two considerable challenges: i) the significant inflationary pressures to which they have been subject for months; and ii) the expectation of tighter global financial conditions in the near future.",
        "He/she pointed out that for economies that are already facing significant inflationary pressures, deferring their monetary policy response to synchronize it with that of the Federal Reserve would imply the risk of contaminating inflation expectations, eroding the credibility of monetary authorities, and would require greater adjustments in the future.",
        "He/she added that, on the contrary, inducing more restrictive monetary conditions in a timely manner would avoid a greater impact on price formation and would favor a more orderly adjustment in the economy as a whole, which would lead to better conditions to face episodes of volatility.",
        "He/she stated that this reflection applies to the case of the Mexican economy.",
        "financial markets exhibited greater volatility, associated with the new variant of the virus, the normalization of monetary policy by the main central banks, and the increase in world inflation.",
        "They highlighted the increase in interest rates of short-term government bonds, particularly in the United States, which contributed to a generalized appreciation of the US dollar.",
        "Some members highlighted the increase in risk aversion in equity markets.",
        "One member stated that stock markets in advanced economies fluctuated markedly, although he/she pointed out that in the United States, gains were reported given the Federal Reserve's decision.",
        "Some members mentioned that, in this context, financial markets of emerging economies exhibited a negative bias.",
        "One member noted that stock markets fell, interest rates increased, and currencies depreciated against the US dollar, although these last ones registered a favorable behavior after the Federal Reserve's announcement.",
        "Another member stated that capital flows channeled to fixed-income instruments registered outflows, while those destined to equity showed positive movements.",
        "The majority mentioned that looking ahead, global financial conditions are expected to tighten in light of the expected earlier withdrawal of monetary stimulus by the Federal Reserve.",
        "One member stated that this will be a risk factor for capital flows in emerging economies.",
        "The majority mentioned that information up to October shows a recovery of economic activity, after the contraction observed during the third quarter.",
        "However, they noted that the recovery remains fragile, incomplete and heterogeneous across sectors.",
        "One member noted that activity will close the year below pre-pandemic levels.",
        "Another member noted that the pandemic remains the main risk to economic activity.",
        "He/she added that the new variant of the virus could represent a setback to the recovery.",
        "On the demand side, most members highlighted remained at high levels in October.",
        "However, they mentioned that disruptions in supply chains that month, said exports were 9.04% lower than in February 2020.",
        "Another member noted that after having driven the economic recovery, exports have lost momentum.",
        "The majority underlined that consumption showed a certain recovery in September, although some members pointed out that its recovery remains weak.",
        "Some members stated that consumption could continue recovering during the fourth quarter and one indicated that it would be supported by the increase in the wage bill and in remittances.",
        "The majority mentioned that dynamism as it registered a contraction in September.",
        "One member highlighted that the fall in investment, both in construction and in machinery and equipment, places it as one of the most lagging variables, which shows the need to foster conditions conducive to investing.",
        "Another member pointed out that it remains stagnant since March and 16% below its highest level reached in 2018.",
        "He/she stated that timely indicators suggest that its lack of dynamism will continue during the fourth quarter.",
        "On the supply side, some members mentioned that industrial production improved in October, mainly driven by manufacturing, particularly of transport equipment.",
        "One member highlighted that construction contracted once again in October.",
        "Looking ahead, another member pointed out that a rebound in industrial production is anticipated, especially in non-automotive manufacturing, driven by external demand.",
        "One member mentioned that the performance of services remains heterogeneous across subsectors.",
        "He/she indicated that, within business-support services, those related to employment fell sharply in September, as a reflection of the labor outsourcing reform.",
        "He/she mentioned that the services sector is expected to slightly rebound in October.",
        "The majority noted that the labor market affected relative to pre-pandemic levels.",
        "One member highlighted that in October the levels of labor participation and employment improved.",
        "Another member noted the recovery in formal employment, which has already exceeded the level observed in February 2020.",
        "He/she added that separations and hires caused by the new labor outsourcing reform appear to have compensated each other, thus maintaining employment at stable levels.",
        "One member pointed out that, although the level of alternative unemployment declined slightly in October, it remains above pre-pandemic levels.",
        "Another member pointed out that both national and urban unemployment rates are above pre-pandemic levels, and that the underemployment rate is above the labor market remains uneven in terms of gender.",
        "One member added that inequality is also observed by age groups.",
        "Most members noted that the recent increase in the minimum wage could exert pressures on labor costs.",
        "One member stated that the increase in the unit labor cost indicates an upward trend, as a result of an increase in mean real wages and a decline in productivity.",
        "All members agreed that slack conditions have persisted.",
        "Most members pointed out that significant differences are still observed across sectors.",
        "One member noted that output gap estimations indicate that slack conditions remained wide during the fourth quarter.",
        "Another member mentioned that the deviation of economic activity from the trend that would have been observed in the absence of the pandemic is of around 10%.",
        "One member considered that slack conditions remain sensitive to both direct and indirect factors associated with the pandemic, and, to a lesser extent, to monetary conditions.",
        "Some members highlighted the problems to measure slack conditions in the economy.",
        "One member underlined that underestimating the amount of slack could lead to equivocal decisions, as it could contribute to overestimate the magnitude of demand-related inflationary pressures and to underestimate the costs associated with a less accommodative policy stance.",
        "Another member warned that the negative output gap is probably being overestimated in view of a lower potential GDP, given that supercore inflation has continued following an upward trend despite the ample slack conditions.",
        "All members stated that global and domestic inflationary pressures continue affecting annual headline and core inflation.",
        "Most members mentioned that in November annual headline inflation reached its highest level since January 2001.",
        "They highlighted that the prices of more than half of the generic items that comprise the CPI are growing at rates above 5%.",
        "One member noted that the monthly inflation rate exhibited an increase unseen for the month of November since it once again exceeded the projections of both private sector economic analysts and Banco de México.",
        "He/she considered that the fact that the annual growth rates of multiple components are above the inflation target reflect not only problems associated with products affected by bottlenecks, but rather a generalized problem.",
        "One member pointed out that the inflation rates of all CPI components show clear upward trends, which suggests that the peak has not been reached.",
        "Some members underlined that different inflation indicators, such as the trimmed mean indicator and supercore inflation point to a steady upward trend.",
        "One member added that the trimmed mean indicator of headline inflation was in 2003.",
        "Most members stated that, due to the deep economic integration with the United States, the higher levels of inflation in that country have contributed to the rebound in inflation in Mexico.",
        "One member highlighted that in the United States the producer price index reached 9.6%, while in Mexico it registered an annual change of 9.9% in November.",
        "Another member underlined that, considering the high levels of inflation that will persist in the United States in 2022, there could be more imported inflation.",
        "Some members pointed out that headline inflation is currently influenced by an adverse base effect, as a result of an extension in the number of days that comprise the “Buen Fin” discount sales campaign during 2020.",
        "One member mentioned that, considering the aforementioned, in November last year, annualized monthly inflation was exceptionally low and close to zero, and core inflation registered deflation.",
        "He/she added that, even if in November this year monthly inflation would have been in line with its historic average, the annual rate would have exceeded 7% in either case, given that 67% of the increase in annual inflation between October and November is attributed to the base effect.",
        "He/she pointed out that the rest of the increase in inflation was due to additional pressures.",
        "However, these occurred in a context of higher mobility and spending, due to an improvement in the indicators of contagion, and thus there is no reason for the sudden increase in demand to repeat itself.",
        "All members mentioned that core inflation faced pressures in merchandise prices and a rebound in services prices.",
        "Some members highlighted that the core component accumulated 12 consecutive monthly increases in November.",
        "Some members noted that in said month annual core inflation was the highest in 20 years.",
        "One member pointed out that it has been above 4% since March, and that supercore inflation is increasingly close to surpassing it.",
        "Another member considered core inflation dynamics a cause of concern, as, after having shown a resistance to decline until 2019, it has been clearly following an upward trend, indicating that there has been a pass-through of second-round effects to the rest of the economy.",
        "One member pointed out that the increase of annual core inflation in October and November is largely explained by the base effect related to greater number of days comprising last year’s “Buen Fin” sales campaign.",
        "Most members mentioned that merchandise prices have reacted to the increase in international prices and to disruptions in productive processes.",
        "Some members mentioned that pressures have continued to intensify both on food and non-food merchandise.",
        "One member highlighted that the above occurred despite the “Buen Fin” sales.",
        "Another member pointed out that over 70% of merchandise components registered annual changes above 5%.",
        "He/she added that the increase in merchandise prices is higher than that registered in 2009, when the peso depreciation exceeded 35% at some point.",
        "Some members pointed out that the variation in services prices continues to rebound, reaching levels close to 4%, pressured by components different from education and housing.",
        "One member mentioned that, despite the recent increase in annual inflation, the biennial annualized inflation of services remains around 3%, which indicates that pressures on this component remain limited.",
        "Most members stated that pressures on non-core inflation increased.",
        "They highlighted the annual rates of change of agricultural and livestock product prices, and government-authorized prices are accumulating cost pressures that could cause an increase in inflation next year.",
        "Another member stated that non-core inflation has almost reached its highest level in twenty years.",
        "All members mentioned that headline and core inflation expectations for 2021, 2022 and for the next 12 months increased again, along with expectations have remained stable at levels above the target.",
        "Most members pointed out that expectations corresponding to the end of 2022 are already above the upper limit of the target range.",
        "One member mentioned that more than half of the private sector economic analysts interviewed believe that inflation will be above 4% in the next 12 months and in 2022, and that the probability that it will be above 5% has started to increase.",
        "Another member stated that the deterioration in short-term expectations is estimated to extend until 2023, given that monthly inflation expectations have consistently been below observed figures.",
        "However, one member mentioned that the National Survey on Consumer Confidence (ENCO, for its acronym in Spanish) shows a more favorable outlook for expectations for the next 12 months, given that these do not show a significant upward trend, have not reached their worst level since the beginning of the pandemic, and are far below the levels reached during the 2017 inflationary episode.",
        "Another member noted that analysts do not expect inflation to decrease as fast as estimated by the central bank and that there is a significant discrepancy regarding the rate of decrease of the core component.",
        "He/she pointed out that the increase in medium-term headline inflation expectations is worrying, as these are at 3.68% despite the fact that the ones corresponding to the following two years are at 3.5%.",
        "He/she noted that this indicates the presence of doubts regarding the convergence of inflation to its target in the medium term.",
        "One member stated that, if the deterioration in medium-term expectations is not addressed, these could contaminate long-term expectations.",
        "Some members highlighted that inflation expectations drawn from market instruments remain high.",
        "One member pointed out that they are above those drawn from surveys.",
        "Another member added that said expectations have continued following an upward trend, particularly those of 1- to 5-year expectations.",
        "One member mentioned that the average of 6- to 10- year expectations is at 3% and that they show a lower variability than short-term ones.",
        "Another member stated that inflationary risk premia decreased during last month.",
        "One member considered the high levels of the breakeven inflation rate implicit in medium- and long-term bonds as worrisome.",
        "Some members warned that de-anchoring of inflation expectations is one of the most important challenges faced by monetary policy.",
        "All members stated that the forecasts for headline and core inflation were once again revised upwards, especially those for 2022.",
        "The majority of members mentioned that it is expected that, in its annual measurement, they will decrease to a larger extent after one year and that they will converge to the 3% target by the end of the forecast horizon.",
        "Some members noted that the upward revisions reflect an exchange rate depreciation and additional inflationary pressures.",
        "One member mentioned that the systematic revisions to the inflation forecast show how difficult it has been to determine the duration of bottlenecks, how long high transportation and freight costs will be maintained, and the unusual variations in commodities.",
        "Some members pointed out that the pressures originate from the core component.",
        "One member added the effects registered in non-core inflation and a higher-than-expected increase in minimum wages.",
        "He/she stated that upward revisions to forecasts have been made for over six months and that the most recent one was of considerable magnitude.",
        "Another member noted that the core component shows a strong upward adjustment, especially for the first quarter of 2022, although it is expected to decline from the second quarter of that year.",
        "One member considered that supply chain disruptions and input shortages are likely to remain until mid-2022, and that their effects could be exacerbated by the new variant of the virus.",
        "He/she noted that it cannot be expected that an economic slowdown will contain the increase in prices.",
        "He/she added that the emergence of new shocks and a more adverse behavior of the non-core component could prevent the convergence to the target within the forecast horizon.",
        "Another member stated that providing the annualized seasonally adjusted quarterly inflation forecasts in each monetary policy decision will give the public greater elements for evaluating and monitoring the current inflationary environment, which will contribute to better price formation.",
        "Some members mentioned that the phenomenon of readjustment in relative prices and the arguments about the transitory nature of inflationary pressures no longer seem appropriate to explain the current situation, since the increase in inflation has been persistent and widespread.",
        "One member highlighted that headline inflation and its components show an upward trend under different methodologies.",
        "He/she added that this phenomenon has begun to contaminate inflation expectations and that the prolonged duration of price increases is not only a reflection of bottlenecks, but also of global demand pressures.",
        "Another member noted that the debate on the transitory nature of the pressures has been left behind given the accumulation of inflationary shocks that will last for a longer period of time and whose effects will outlast the pandemic.",
        "He/she said that the high breakeven inflation rate implicit in medium- and long-term bonds reflects the fact that investors perceive inflationary pressures to be more permanent.",
        "One member noted that a large part of the inflationary shocks has been associated with the pandemic and that these have coincided with other shocks whose origins precede the pandemic.",
        "He/she added that the slow fading and uncertain duration of these shocks could lead to a scenario where high inflation synchronizes with new shocks that prevent the convergence of inflation and de-anchor expectations.",
        "Another member mentioned that longterm expectations drawn from market instruments are close to 3%, which is consistent with the perception that pressures are transitory.",
        "He/she stated that, although the shocks have been prolonged, it is important to remember that their origin was due to the change in consumption patterns and supply restrictions that have generated an increase in the prices of goods at a global level; to the increase in international commodity prices; and to a reversion in the trend of prices of services and some goods, which means that their inflation levels will be high for some more months, without this implying a lack of control in the price formation process.",
        "He/she pointed out that the first two factors are affecting domestic prices despite the domestic slack conditions.",
        "He/she estimated that pressures will tend to fade insofar as the world economy continues evolving towards a more homogeneous recovery, with more control of the pandemic, which will favor the mitigation of the abovementioned supply restrictions.",
        "He/she noted that signals in this direction are already beginning to be observed, such as food and industrial inputs price stability and improvements in transportation indicators.",
        "Among upward risks to inflation, the majority of pressures.",
        "Some members mentioned cost-related pressures, an exchange rate depreciation and energy price increases.",
        "One member added the persistence of core inflation at high levels.",
        "Some members mentioned the effects of the recent increase in the minimum wage.",
        "One member stated that this could be observed as a result of the growing proportion of workers with a salary close to this new reference value.",
        "Another member stated that this wage policy, together with the deterioration of labor productivity, is an internal factor that could reinforce inflationary pressures and trigger a wage-price spiral, eroding workers' purchasing power.",
        "One member added as a risk the pressures that are still being observed in the prices of commodities, food, and in producer prices, in addition to the volatility of the exchange rate.",
        "He/she highlighted that those core inflation items that are more susceptible to the exchange rate and energy prices could continue registering larger increases.",
        "Among downward risks, another member pointed out: i) the widening of the negative output gap, ii) social distancing measures, and iii) exchange rate appreciation.",
        "The majority of members mentioned that the balance of risks with respect to the expected trajectory of inflation over the forecast horizon deteriorated Most members noted that domestic financial markets have recently registered volatility.",
        "Some members mentioned that this was due to both international and idiosyncratic factors.",
        "In this regard, succession process.",
        "He/she mentioned that risks to financial markets increased moderately.",
        "The majority of members noted that the peso depreciated.",
        "One member noted that this was a result of the Federal Reserve's less accommodative policy stance, the deterioration of the trade balance, and the greater local uncertainty.",
        "Another member explained that the national currency proved to be highly sensitive to fluctuations in global financial markets, especially in relation to other emerging market currencies.",
        "In this context, some members warned about the negative variation in the holdings of foreign investors in peso-denominated assets.",
        "One member added that, recently, long-term bond holdings, which had been relatively stable, have also been affected, despite the fact that Mexico keeps a better relative position as compared to other emerging market economies.",
        "Another member stated that foreign holdings of government securities as a percentage of the total amount outstanding reached their lowest level in a decade.",
        "He/she mentioned that capital flows are more sensitive to interest rate spreads.",
        "Some members mentioned that medium- and long-term interest rates registered upward adjustments, influenced by external conditions.",
        "They noted that the Mexican stock market performed negatively.",
        "One member mentioned that sovereign risk indicators increased and another member noted that there is an increase in risk aversion by the private sector, which is showing a preference for highly liquid assets over term instruments.",
        "He/she mentioned that net corporate debt placements in the domestic and foreign markets exhibited low dynamism, reflecting a cautious behavior.",
        "One member mentioned that credit to firms and households remains deteriorated, and that financing to Small- and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) is still more than 12% below pre-pandemic levels.",
        "Another member noted that the contraction in domestic credit is due to factors that are beyond the reach of monetary policy, such as business agents’ reluctance to invest.",
        "One member noted that the corporate credit portfolio increased slightly in October, which contributed to mitigate its annual contraction.",
        "He/she added that monetary aggregates continue registering a slowdown compared to last year, although they remain at high levels.",
        "The Governing Board evaluated the magnitude and diversity of the shocks that have affected inflation and the factors that determine it, along contaminated, and the challenges posed by the ongoing tightening of monetary and financial considerations, on this occasion, the majority of the Board decided to increase the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 50 basis points to 5.50%.",
        "The Board highlighted that, with this action, the monetary policy stance adjusts to the trajectory required for inflation to converge to its target.",
        "For the next monetary policy decisions, the Board will monitor pressures as well as of all factors that have an incidence on the foreseen path for inflation and its expectations.",
        "The latter, in order to determine a policy rate that is consistent at all times with the trajectory needed to facilitate the orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to the 3% target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates as well as an adequate adjustment of the economy and One member stated that in the absence of other factors contributing to dissipate pressures on financial markets and the exchange rate, a moderate tightening of the monetary policy stance is necessary.",
        "However, he/she warned that this should be done with caution, given that an overly restrictive policy stance could affect economic growth and, eventually, capital flows and the exchange rate, thereby going against the original objective of the aforementioned policy.",
        "He/she noted that several emerging market economies were able to provide greater monetary stimuli in 2020 and 2021 than Mexico despite having less strong macroeconomic fundamentals.",
        "He/she argued that, if a more gradual tightening policy had been chosen during 2021, or more stimulus measures provided during 2020, there would be more room today to pursue financial stability and maintain an accommodative policy, as other emerging economies have done.",
        "He/she mentioned that continuous interest rate increases in necessary to sacrifice this stance to achieve such stability.",
        "He/she added that moving too far ahead of the Fed's rate normalization process puts the economy at risk of falling into a trap of low growth and financial instability.",
        "He/she highlighted the importance of analyzing and communicating the nature of the current inflationary phenomenon, related to exogenous and global factors, which will begin to fade in the following months, and added that monetary policy can do very little to contain such pressures.",
        "He/she recalled that continuous rate increases have failed to prevent inflation in Mexico from rising to levels not seen in two decades.",
        "He/she stated that, instead, interest rate increases do imply a high cost for economic activity in Mexico, affecting credit, investment, consumption, financial markets and public finances.",
        "He/she considered that the argument of controlling expectations seems insufficient to justify the continuous increases, since short-term expectations have continued to rise despite the interest rate increases.",
        "He/she pointed out that, on the one hand, not all measurements of medium-term expectations have been affected, while long-term expectations are stable, which is consistent with the transitory nature of inflationary pressures.",
        "Another member pointed out that, in light of the Federal Reserve's accelerated removal of its asset purchases, the data regarding inflation, and the deterioration of its expectations, decisive actions are essential to promote the anchoring of inflation expectations.",
        "He/she pointed out that monetary policy reinforcing initiated this year was intended to act preemptively to avoid possible second-round effects, a de-anchoring of inflation expectations, and the contamination of price formation in Mexico, and that, with this objective, the interest rate had been raised by 100 basis points.",
        "He/she noted that, despite these increases, the ex-ante real interest rate has been adjusted by less than a quarter of a percentage point since June so far, given that inflation expectations have continued to deteriorate, which suggests that monetary policy has to be more decisive in view of the level of observed inflation and the uncertainty about the duration of the shocks that are being faced.",
        "He/she recalled than in an inflation forecast targeting regime, the monetary policy stance must insure that the projected inflation trajectory tends to converge to the target and that, if monetary policy adjustments are perceived as highly credible, then the shocks will not manage to divert inflation from its target in a sustained manner, expectations will remain anchored, and there will be gains in the efficiency of inflation convergence, and thus he/she considered that maintaining a framework of credible actions is currently an imperative task.",
        "He/she pointed out that his/her vote seeks to propitiate an adequate formation of inflation expectations and their firm anchoring.",
        "He/she stated that, given the macroeconomic fundamentals of the Mexican economy, the monetary strengthening should not require increases similar to those observed in other economies.",
        "However, he/she stated that, given the current uncertain environment, it is necessary to show an unequivocal commitment to Banco de México’s constitutional mandate and to take on a more robust monetary policy approach.",
        "One member noted that since the previous monetary policy decision, inflation has reached very high levels, with an outlook for longer external and internal pressures.",
        "He/she warned that the contamination of the price formation process demands a faster, firm and proactive pace of adjustment that considers all the factors, not mechanically, but rather upon adequate consideration.",
        "This, in order to maintain an inflation trajectory convergent to the target, which allows for the anchoring of expectations and the synchronization of local and global monetary cycles.",
        "He/she pointed out that a balance must be found between a weak economic recovery, persistent inflationary pressures, and the beginning of the new monetary tightening cycle by the Federal Reserve.",
        "He/she stated that Banco de México’s autonomy, the impossibility of financing the government, and the good performance of public finances have prevented falling into a situation of fiscal dominance.",
        "However, he/she pointed out that the argument of not raising the rate because it would have an effect on public spending through an increase in financial costs, may introduce elements of fiscal dominance that would harm the proper functioning of monetary policy.",
        "He/she highlighted that it is essential to send clear signals of commitment to the primary mandate in order to preserve the institution’s credibility.",
        "To this end, he/she was of the opinion that the inflation forecast targeting regime, which relies on the transmission channel of expectations, should be strengthened.",
        "He/she pointed out that considering that an increase in the monetary policy rate sends the opposite signal by increasing inflation expectations, is not consistent with the current monetary strategy and leads to the danger of inflation that is higher and difficult to control, similar to what Turkey is currently undergoing.",
        "He/she argued that a proactive attitude prevents a further deterioration of expectations.",
        "Therefore, he/she emphasized that the monetary policy response should be proportional to the inflationary outlook in order to preserve credibility and the long-term anchoring of expectations.",
        "He/she stated that, looking ahead, the Governing Board will continue to work together to find the best strategy to meet Banco de México's primary mandate in the current complex environment.",
        "Another member considered that, in view of inflation risks and of the adjustments to forecasts, and in order to serve responsibly the central bank's primary mandate, it is essential to increase the pace of removal of monetary stimulus.",
        "He/she emphasized that, in the absence of a more decisive and forceful action that ratifies the commitment to the primary objective, there is a risk of losing credibility and of a de-anchoring of inflation expectations, which would imply exceedingly costly measures for the population, especially for those of lower incomes.",
        "He/she argued that in view of the results obtained so far, the monetary policy strategy should be reconsidered.",
        "He/she noted that the inflationary outlook has deteriorated during the year to levels not seen in two decades, while the response has remained gradual, cautious and data-dependent.",
        "He/she stated that this was made feasible by a policy stance in June 2021 that allowed some margin to adopt a gradualist approach.",
        "He/she stated that the continuous upward revisions to the inflation forecasts show that the strategy has not been effective in containing inflation and its expectations.",
        "He/she pointed out that this strategy poses a risk for Banco de México’s expectations and credibility, in the event that there is a perceived lack of consistency between the monetary policy statements and the actions taken.",
        "He/she noted that the monetary policy statement should emphasize the deterioration of the inflation outlook and the upward bias of the balance of risks.",
        "He/she added that the statement should endorse the commitment that the necessary actions will be taken to ensure the convergence of inflation to the target and the firm anchoring of expectations.",
        "He/she highlighted that inflationary pressures from abroad and due to supply shocks will remain even with the monetary policy stance adjustment; nevertheless, the latter mainly seeks to strengthen the expectations channel and limit demand-related pressures.",
        "He/she added that this adjustment places Banco de México strategically to face the tighter global financial conditions that will be observed during 2022, especially considering that the Mexican peso is strongly exposed to external shocks, and above all given the upcoming shift in advanced economies’ monetary stimuli, mainly in the United States.",
        "He/she estimated that risks will be faced that must be addressed in a timely and decisive manner.",
        "One member highlighted that although the monetary policy target rate has increased by 100 basis points throughout the year, with the increase of more than practically unchanged between May and November.",
        "He/she argued that the monetary policy stance should consider: i) the magnitude and diversity of the shocks that have driven headline and core inflation to levels unseen in two decades; ii) the persistent uncertainty about global price dynamics; iii) the high risk of price formation and inflation expectations becoming contaminated; and iv) the challenges faced by a small emerging economy that is highly integrated to world financial markets, in view of the tightening of global monetary and financial conditions that may imply capital outflows and exchange raterelated pressures.",
        "He/she added that these economies, which supplement their internal savings with external sources, must maintain sustainable public finances, a monetary policy focused on low and stable inflation, and a strong financial system.",
        "He/she stated that monetary policy should keep inflation expectations anchored, bring about orderly conditions in the exchange market, contain risk premia along the yield curve, and enable the convergence of headline inflation to its 3% target.",
        "He/she added that in the current context, the trajectory of monetary policy implies exceeding the upper limit of the interval for the neutral rate in real terms within the forecast horizon.",
        "He/she pointed out that the role of monetary policy is to maintain inflation around its target, ensuring that the high levels it has reached are transitory, and avoiding the contamination of price formation.",
        "He/she considered that tolerating high inflation levels, well above the target, without making the necessary adjustments, would affect price formation and lead to a significant deterioration of domestic financial markets.",
        "He/she underlined that this would represent hindering the convergence of inflation to its target and would erode the hard-earned credibility of Banco de México.",
        "He/she emphasized that in the current context, the central bank’s commitment to its constitutional mandate of protecting the peso’s purchasing power must be reinforced.",
        "The Governing Board evaluated the magnitude and diversity of the shocks that have affected inflation and the factors that determine it, along with the risk of price formation becoming contaminated, and the challenges posed by the ongoing tightening of monetary and financial global conditions.",
        "Based on these considerations, on this occasion, the Board decided to increase the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 50 basis points to 5.50%.",
        "With this action, the monetary policy stance adjusts to the trajectory required for inflation to converge to its 3% target within the forecast horizon.",
        "For the next monetary policy decisions, the Board will monitor thoroughly the behavior of inflationary pressures as well as of all factors that have an incidence on the foreseen path for inflation and its expectations.",
        "The latter, in order to determine a policy rate that is consistent at all times with the trajectory needed to facilitate the orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to the policy operates as well as an adequate adjustment of the economy and financial markets.",
        "Alejandro Díaz de León, Galia Borja, Irene Espinosa, and Jonathan Heath voted in favor of increasing the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 50 basis points to 5.50%.",
        "Gerardo Esquivel voted in favor of increasing the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 25 basis points to 5.25%.",
        "Expectations of a less accommodative policy stance by the Federal Reserve affected global financial conditions.",
        "This, along with idiosyncratic factors, has generated greater uncertainty and volatility in local markets.",
        "For this reason, I believe the monetary policy stance must be reinforced.",
        "This process should be moderate, as an overly restrictive policy stance could have several negative implications.",
        "A short-term vision that reacts mechanically with rate increases before any shock should be avoided.",
        "Understanding and properly communicating the nature of the current inflationary phenomenon is crucial.",
        "This phenomenon is explained by exogenous factors that will begin to fade in subsequent months without the need for prematurely tightening local monetary conditions excessively.",
        "Continued rate increases did not prevent inflation from rising to levels unseen in two decades.",
        "The reason is that the origin of this episode is predominantly external.",
        "The argument of controlling expectations, which has justified said increases, has been disproved by the facts, since short-term expectations have not stopped rising despite such increases.",
        "In perspective, it should be considered that getting too far ahead of the Fed's normalization process puts the economy at risk of falling into a trap of low growth and financial instability.",
        "Most members stated that, during the first quarter of the year, global economic activity grew at a lower-than-anticipated rate.",
        "They considered that the lower dynamism was mainly caused by disruptions in supply chains, partly as a result of recent mobility restrictions in China, and by the economic repercussions resulting from the Ukraine.",
        "One member added the lower economic stimuli compared to the previous year.",
        "He/she stated that the degree of heterogeneity in the recovery between advanced and emerging economies has increased.",
        "He/she indicated that the United States, despite undergoing a slowdown, shows a strong domestic demand, with a favorable performance in industrial production.",

        "One member warned that the high levels of public and private debt reduce the global economy's room for maneuver against new shocks.",
        "Another member stated that the balance of risks for global economic growth is biased to the downside and subject to unusually high uncertainty.",
        "All members highlighted the impact of the geopolitical conflict on world inflation.",

        "They noted that, in some cases, inflation reached its highest level in decades.",
        "One member pointed out that the conflict has involved disruptions in global trade that have reduced the supply of various commodities, with several countries implementing export restrictions on certain food products.",
        "Another member stated that its effect on commodity prices is detrimental to households' incomes, undermines investors' confidence, and increases uncertainty in general.",

        "One member stated that, if the pace of adjustments anticipated by markets materializes, in 2023 the United States would have a rate above the level estimated as neutral.",
        "Another member indicated that given expectations of a further monetary tightening, shortterm interest rates in the United States increased, with a flattening of the yield curve.",
        "Regarding emerging economies, one member mentioned that, although they have started to reduce the stimulus, the pace of normalization has been heterogeneous due to differences in economic recovery and inflation dynamics.",
        "He/she noted that Chile and Brazil, which have undergone a stronger economic recovery, have had to rapidly implement tighter monetary policy stances than their peers, while Mexico has made more moderate adjustments because it provided less monetary stimulus during the pandemic.",
        "Another member noted that, given the elevated inflation levels and the risk of expectations becoming unanchored, emerging economies central banks’ decision to accelerate monetary tightening reflects their priority to control inflation.",

        "One member pointed out that this was partly the result of a faster normalization of the monetary policy stance in the United States.",
        "He/she added that the latter, together with the uncertainty associated with the military conflict, was reflected in an increase in practically all nodes of the US yield curve and in a correction of more than 11% in its main stock market index.",

        "One member added that inflation expectations drawn from market instruments have increased and that the inflation risk premium registered its highest level in April, although it remains at levels similar to those observed during other stress periods.",
        "Another member pointed out that inflation expectations drawn from market instruments for the 6- to 10-year average remain at Most members stated that, in view of greater- forecasts for headline and core inflation were revised upwards up to the second and the third convergence to the 3% target during the first quarter of 2024 is maintained.",
        "One member highlighted that the upward revision took place even after incorporating the impact of the Policy Program to Fight Inflation and High Prices.",
        "Another member noted that, considering the recent dynamics of core inflation, it can be inferred that it is about to reach its peak and that it could soon begin a downward trend.",
        "One member underlined that, so far, there have been eleven consecutive monetary policy decisions in which the central bank has revised the inflation forecast upwards, either for a particular time frame or for the entire forecast horizon.",
        "He/she highlighted that this is not exclusive to the central bank’s projections.",
        "He/she pointed out that monetary authorities in other countries and market analysts have also adjusted their forecasts to the upside, which reflects the high degree of uncertainty that has prevailed.",
        "Another member stated that the convergence of inflation to its target faces significant risks.",
        "Among upward risks to inflation, all members mentioned the greater pressures on agricultural and livestock product prices and energy prices, due to the geopolitical conflict.",
        "Most members mentioned the persistence of core inflation at high levels and external inflationary pressures associated with the pandemic.",
        "Some members added the cost-related pressures associated with wage revisions, which could be passed through to consumer prices.",
        "One member added an exchange rate depreciation, due to possible bouts of volatility in international financial markets.",
        "He/she mentioned that, although the military conflict has already started to exert pressure on inflation, the scope, duration and magnitude of possible shocks derived from it are still unknown.",
        "He/she also indicated that there is no certainty as to the time required to regularize supply chains.",
        "Another member pointed out the possible continuation of droughts, which would affect agricultural products’ prices.",
        "He/she considered that the pressures caused by the conflict in Ukraine could potentially affect the formation of inflation expectations due to their greater effect on households and families.",
        "One member stated that, although the shock to commodity prices associated with the military conflict poses a significant risk, historically it tends to be solved through higher supply when global markets operate adequately.",
        "He/she stated that uncertainty in measuring economic slack makes it difficult to anticipate possible price pressures in certain sectors that are recovering.",
        "One member pointed out that a high and persistent inflation could contaminate the price formation process.",
        "He/she added that different indicators, such as the upward revision in analysts and markets’ expectations, and minimum wage revisions that exceed labor productivity growth, suggest that this is already happening.",
        "He/she added that the fact that inflation has not stopped accelerating and is affecting an increasing number of goods and services is a cause for concern.",
        "Regarding downside risks to inflation, some members mentioned a better functioning of supply chains, as a result of the control of the pandemic.",
        "One member added: i) a decline in the intensity of the military conflict; ii) that, given the slack conditions in the economy, cost-related pressures and hiring conditions do not exert pressure on prices; and iii) a higher-than-expected effect of the Policy Program to Fight Inflation and High Prices.",
        "Some members considered that said program will have moderate effects on inflation.",
        "One member stated that the different measures included in the program go in the right direction as they seek to improve conditions on the supply side, and that they have the potential to affect the price formation process and inflation expectations.",
        "He/she estimated that the program could contribute to reduce inflationary pressures at the margin.",
        "On the other hand, he/she argued that a number of factors point to a moderation of world inflation in 2022, such as less expansionary policy stances by most governments and central banks worldwide, as well as signs of a mitigation of pressures on supply chains.",
        "Most members stated that the balance of risks for the trajectory of inflation within the forecast horizon remains biased to the upside and has continued deteriorating.",
        "One member pointed out that this is due to the possibility that the effects of the geopolitical conflict are greater or longer-lasting than previously estimated.",
        "Some members highlighted an environment of greater uncertainty for inflation.",
        "Regarding domestic financial markets, most members highlighted that the exchange rate remained relatively stable.",
        "They underlined the performance of the Mexican peso despite the conditions.",
        "They emphasized that the Mexican peso remains the second currency with the highest volatility-adjusted interest rate spread relative to the United States.",
        "Some members considered that the favorable performance of the currency is attributed to the sound macroeconomic fundamentals, such as fiscal discipline and a prudent monetary policy.",
        "One member added that it is also due to the moderate deficit in the current account.",
        "He/she stated that, from a medium-term perspective, the performance and the relative low volatility of the Mexican peso sets it apart from other emerging economy currencies.",
        "Another member pointed out that, in this favorable context, analysts kept their exchange rate outlook practically unchanged.",
        "Most members mentioned that interest rates increased in line with global trends.",
        "Some members noted that practically all nodes of the yield curve increased, with up to 100 basis points increments in the longer-term ones.",
        "Meanwhile, one member stated that the real yield curve also registered generalized increases, albeit of a lower magnitude, given the greater demand for instruments that offer protection against inflation.",
        "He/she mentioned that there was an outflow of M-Bonos held by foreign investors and an inflow of resources channeled to Udibonos seeking to mitigate the risk of higher inflation.",
        "Some members pointed out that the stock market fell by 11%.",
        "One member mentioned that default premia increased by over 40 basis points.",
        "Regarding the evolution of credit, another member stated that commercial banks’ financing to businesses continued performing poorly.",
        "He/she mentioned that, while businesses’ demand for credit has started to reactivate, lending standards have somewhat deteriorated, as a reflection of supplyrelated constraints.",
        "Some members warned that the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy stance represents a significant challenge as well for the stability of the financial system.",
        "One member indicated that, if the risk of the Federal Reserve undergoing a faster tightening cycle materializes, the Mexican peso will follow a more depreciated trajectory.",
        "Another member warned that Mexico, like other economies facing high risks and with a high degree of financial and commercial integration to the external sector, must maintain a solid macroeconomic policy stance at all times.",
        "The Governing Board evaluated the magnitude and diversity of the shocks that have affected inflation and its determinants, along with the risk and price formation becoming contaminated.",
        "Most members also considered the increasing challenges posed by the ongoing tightening of global monetary and financial conditions, the environment of significant uncertainty, and greater inflationary pressures associated with the geopolitical conflict, the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in China, and the possibility of inflation being affected by additional pressures.",
        "Based on these considerations, the majority voted for raising the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 50 basis points to 7.00%.",
        "The Board highlighted that, with this action, the monetary policy stance adjusts to the trajectory required for inflation to converge to its The Governing Board stated that for the next monetary policy decisions, it will monitor inflationary pressures thoroughly as well as all factors that have an incidence on the foreseen path for inflation and its expectations.",
        "The latter, in order to set a policy rate that is consistent at all times with the orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to the 3% target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates as well as with an adequate adjustment of the economy and financial markets.",
        "Most members added that, given the growing complexity in the environment for inflation and its expectations, taking more forceful measures to attain the inflation target One member pointed out that the strengthening of monetary policy contributes to: i) preventing secondround effects given the new supply-related shocks; ii) maintaining financial stability, considering the increase in the Federal Reserve’s federal funds rate; and iii) helping the interest rate move closer to a level considered as neutral.",
        "He/she warned that inflation is high and thus it is critical to make adequate decisions to lower it.",
        "He/she also stated that said actions should be taken efficiently, with the least possible costs for society.",
        "He/she listed the factors that should be considered when defining an adequate trajectory for the interest rate under the current upward cycle.",
        "He/she pointed out that, above all, inflation is a global phenomenon, and that for this reason inflation in Mexico will decrease insofar as world inflation also declines.",
        "He/she noted that the second factor is that there was little monetary stimulus granted in 2020 and it began to be withdrawn in advance in 2021, and, therefore, unlike other countries, Mexico does not have a problem of excess demand.",
        "He/she mentioned that the recovery could continue without generating further inflationary pressures, while the monetary policy stance transitions to a neutral level.",
        "He/she underlined that, at the beginning of 2022, the ex-ante real interest rate was among the highest in the world, which has already started to affect credit, durable goods consumption, and investment.",
        "He/she considered that the room to raise the policy rate without affecting economic activity is rather limited.",
        "Therefore, he/she stated that it is important to continue the cycle of increases prudently and avoiding an excessive tightening.",
        "He/she mentioned that a third factor is that excessive monetary tightening entails higher financial costs for the economy as a whole.",
        "He/she warned that an increase in default risk premia is already being observed in emerging economies, which would indicate the limits of a restrictive monetary policy in consolidating macroeconomic stability.",
        "Finally, he/she considered it not advisable to raise the reference rate at a faster pace than the Federal Reserve.",
        "He/she highlighted that the volatilityadjusted interest rate spread relative to the United States is among the highest in emerging economies.",
        "He/she pointed out that both economies are subject to the same global shocks and that Mexico has already made progress in normalizing its monetary policy stance.",
        "In addition, Mexico did not adopt an expansionary fiscal policy stance during the pandemic.",
        "For all of the above, he/she stated that it is unnecessary and even imprudent to adopt a pace of rate increases above that of the Federal Reserve.",
        "He/she mentioned that, looking ahead, conditions might emerge to even start reducing such spread, given the solid macroeconomic fundamentals, the favorable evolution of the Mexican peso, and the relative monetary policy stance.",
        "Another member highlighted that headline inflation is still at high levels and considered highly worrisome that core inflation, the component that most reacts to monetary policy actions, continues trending upwards.",
        "He/she warned about: i) the Federal Reserve's more restrictive monetary policy tightening affecting price formation and financial system stability; ii) uncertainty regarding the continuation of the geopolitical conflict; and iii) mobility restrictions in China and their impact on global supply chains.",
        "He/she warned that although the reference rate has increased by 250 basis points since the beginning of the current cycle, the real ex-ante rate has increased in a smaller proportion, and currently stands around the lower limit of the neutral range.",
        "He/she highlighted that, in past monetary cycles with nominal interest rate levels similar to the current ones, the exante real interest rate increased in a similar magnitude as the nominal interest rate and stood slightly above the neutral interest rate.",
        "However, he/she mentioned that, in the current cycle, the reference rate increases have only been able to compensate for the upward adjustment in inflation expectations and have been less effective in making the ex-ante real interest rate increase to at least its neutral level.",
        "He/she underlined that even considering the unprecedented context, in which the duration and magnitude of the shocks are different from other inflationary episodes, it is imperative to act decisively to ensure that inflation returns to its target within the forecast horizon.",
        "He/she emphasized the importance of monetary policy operating with predictability in order to influence an orderly formation of expectations, and therefore the central bank’s communication should clearly convey that it will consider taking more forceful measures in the next monetary policy decisions, and that it might be necessary for the ex-ante real interest rate to reach a level higher than the neutral rate.",
        "He/she also pointed out that it is essential to consolidate a robust approach that provides absolute certainty about the central bank’s commitment to its constitutional mandate, which mitigates the risk of possible second-round effects on prices, while also ensures the anchoring of inflation expectations to avoid longer-term expectations from becoming contaminated.",
        "One member mentioned that despite accumulating an increase of 250 basis points in the reference rate, the real ex-ante short-term rate stands at 1.7%, slightly below the lower threshold of the estimated range for the neutral rate.",
        "He/she noted that if inflation expectations for the next 12 months stand at estimated to be 3.4% in real terms, the reference rate would need to be above 8% and possibly at levels above 9%.",
        "The challenge is to establish an ideal trajectory, in terms of timing and pace of adjustment, to be able to attain such level.",
        "He/she stated that, since the adoption of the interbank interest rate as an operational target in 2008, only in 9 out of 25 occasions, the target rate has been raised by 50 basis points, and never by 75 basis points, although there has never been such a complex outlook for inflation as the current one.",
        "He/she pointed out that raising the rate by 75 basis points would send a stronger message of commitment to the central bank’s primary objective.",
        "This measure would further dissipate any doubts regarding central bank autonomy, and would restate the institution’s moral obligation with the most vulnerable population.",
        "Moreover, this would imply reaching the neutral zone more rapidly, would help to offset the deterioration of medium-term expectations, would have a greater effect on anchoring long-term expectations, and would provide a stronger relative monetary policy stance to face increases in risk aversion.",
        "However, he/she noted that it would surprise both markets and analysts, making it difficult to forecast the reference rate’s trajectory and distorting the interpretation of the reaction function.",
        "He/she added that such an increase would suggest lower sensibility regarding cyclical conditions in the economy.",
        "It could also mark a new pace of adjustment, difficult to reduce in the context of high inflation, a very restrictive cycle by the Federal Reserve, and cycle of monetary adjustments in Mexico that will last for quite some time.",
        "A faster pace of adjustment might result in an excessively high terminal rate for the sound development of the economy and financial markets.",
        "Meanwhile, he/she noted that a 50 basis-point increase is discounted by markets and analysts, sends a message of commitment to the primary mandate, and is consistent with the narrative of gradual adjustments.",
        "It also allows time to communicate the possibility of increases in the pace of monetary tightening.",
        "He/she added that, with this decision, the nominal rate curve would maintain its current structure, confirming markets’ expectations, while a 75 basis-point increase would lead to a flattening of the yield curve.",
        "He/she mentioned that the current spread of 600 basis points has so far favored the exchange rate.",
        "However, he/she considered that an increase of 50 basis points could be perceived as an insufficient increase in the ex-ante real interest rate in the short term, given the lagged effect with which monetary policy operates and the difficult inflationary context currently faced.",
        "Furthermore, it does not provide the relative monetary policy stance with additional space to face a disruption in financial markets.",
        "This decision also does not hasten the transition of the absolute policy stance to a more restrictive range, given the deterioration of inflation expectations.",
        "He/she pointed out that the current decision should be communicated with a more restrictive tone, categorically signaling the willingness to act more forcefully in the future if forecasts of convergence to the target do not materialize.",
        "Another member stated that since the previous monetary policy decision, inflation has continued accelerating.",
        "He/she pointed out that in addition to further surprises and shocks, monetary policy adjustments have been insufficient to counter the deterioration of price formation and have had a limited impact on the real interest rate, which remains below the required level.",
        "He/she considered that monetary policy has fallen \"behind the curve\" and that, in the current situation, a 50 basis-point increase is insufficient to guarantee the convergence of inflation within the forecast horizon.",
        "Also, the key role of monetary policy is to act decisively and in a timely manner to curb inflationary inertia and avoid more severe rate increases in the future, and for this reason he/she pointed out that it is time to raise the rate of adjustment of monetary policy by 75 basis points.",
        "He/she stated that this action is consistent with the commitment to make the necessary adjustments to comply with the central bank’s primary mandate.",
        "He/she added that given the high uncertainty surrounding the ongoing various shocks, the most prudent course of action is to act sooner rather than later.",
        "He/she highlighted that the expectation that markets have internalized about the current and subsequent monetary policy decisions should be assessed.",
        "He/she stated that although most analysts expect an increase of 50 basis points, three analysts consider the possibility of 75 basis points, and expectations derived from market instruments indicate a higher implicit rate by the end of the year.",
        "He/she mentioned that a surprise on the side of prudence -with a larger increase- is not necessarily bad news, but shows a central bank whose priority is to control inflation.",
        "He/she mentioned that the decision should strengthen both the exchange rate and the expectations channels.",
        "He/she recalled that the latter is one of the most important and that complacency in the face of the observed adjustments warns about the possibility of them starting to become unanchored, which would imply high costs for society.",
        "He/she indicated that a more rapid monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve could affect the exchange rate and impose challenges for monetary policy.",
        "Therefore, he/she added that it is also essential to maintain conditions for a resilient exchange rate.",
        "He/she argued that this decision should validate the Governing Board’s commitment to taking appropriate decisions and should clearly communicate the deterioration of the economic conditions.",
        "One member stated that monetary policy in Mexico faces a significantly complex environment.",
        "He/she mentioned that given the social and economic costs generated by inflation, which affect to a greater extent the lower-income population, it is essential for monetary policy to foster an environment of low and stable inflation.",
        "He/she highlighted that the high levels of inflation, the persistence of the effects of the shocks derived from the pandemic, and the difficulties arising from the military conflict in Ukraine, imply an environment that poses a high risk of contamination of the price formation process.",
        "He/she recalled that inflation expectations continue increasing, and although the output gap is estimated to be wide, the labor market has continued recovering and various cost-related pressures are observed.",
        "He/she added that the outlook for international monetary and financial conditions faces circumstances unseen in decades, which could have a significant impact on domestic financial markets, including the foreign exchange market.",
        "He/she argued that it is thus essential to continue adjusting the monetary policy stance in Mexico, in order for inflation expectations to remain anchored and, therefore, the price formation process to be consistent with the primary objective.",
        "He/she added that the central bank needs to consider more decisive actions, because, if it does not take the necessary measures, longer-term inflation expectations could be affected by both the high levels of inflation and the duration of the shocks that have affected them, as well as by the continuous revisions to the forecasts.",
        "He/she warned that an un-anchoring of expectations must be avoided by taking forceful actions.",
        "He/she stated that the willingness to make full use of the tools to make inflation converge to its target should be restated in the central bank’s communication.",
        "He/she considered it necessary to acknowledge the profound change in global economic and geopolitical conditions, and that an appropriate monetary policy stance could be significantly more astringent than in other circumstances.",
        "He/she pointed out that extraordinary conditions, such as those being faced, may require extraordinary actions.",
        "He/she argued that it is imperative to communicate the central bank's determination to attain convergence of inflation to the target within the forecast horizon, and the willingness to redouble efforts if necessary.",
        "All of the above will contribute to induce orderly conditions in the foreign exchange and fixed income markets in the prevailing environment of higher inflation at a global level.",
        "The Governing Board evaluated the magnitude and diversity of the shocks that have affected inflation and its determinants, along with the risk of mediumand long-term inflation expectations and price formation becoming contaminated.",
        "It also considered the increasing challenges posed by the ongoing tightening of global monetary and financial conditions, the environment of significant uncertainty, and greater inflationary pressures associated with the geopolitical conflict and with the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in China, as well as the possibility of inflation being affected by additional pressures.",
        "Based on these considerations, the Board decided by majority to raise the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 50 basis points to adjusts to the trajectory required for inflation to converge to its 3% target within the forecast horizon.",
        "For the next monetary policy decisions, the Governing Board will monitor thoroughly inflationary pressures as well as all factors that have an incidence on the foreseen path for inflation and its expectations.",
        "The latter, in order to set a policy rate that is consistent at all times with the trajectory needed to facilitate the orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to the 3% target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates as well as an adequate adjustment of the economy and financial markets.",
        "Given the growing complexity in the environment for inflation and its expectations, taking more forceful measures to attain the inflation target may be considered.",
        "Victoria Rodríguez, Galia Borja, Gerardo Esquivel, and Jonathan Heath voted in favor of increasing the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 50 basis points to 7.00%.",
        "Irene Espinosa voted in favor of increasing the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 75 basis points to 7.25%.",
        "Given the intensification of inflationary pressures, our forecasts for headline inflation have been revised upwards for the next five quarters, thus accumulating eleven consecutive decisions in which forecasts have been adjusted to the upside for either part or the entire forecast horizon.",
        "Long-term inflation expectations have also been adjusted marginally above 3.5% for the first time since they began to be estimated.",
        "The faster-than-expected increase in inflation has limited the effect of the monetary policy adjustments implemented in recent months on the real interest rate, which remains below the level required to attain convergence to the 3% target.",
        "In light of these results, an environment of greater uncertainty, highly adverse external conditions, and a balance of risks for inflation that has worsened and is biased upwards, it is essential to act decisively, forcefully, and in a timely manner.",
        "Increasing the pace of monetary tightening to 75 basis points is necessary to attain convergence to the target within the forecast horizon and to reinforce credibility in the central bank's commitment to its primary mandate of maintaining price stability.",
        "Most members mentioned that world economic activity continued recovering during the fourth quarter of 2021, although at a slower rate and heterogeneously across countries and sectors, due to the evolution of the pandemic and the actions implemented by their health, monetary and fiscal authorities.",
        "The majority of members stated that the resurgence of infections led to new restrictions in several countries and that global supply chains remain affected.",
        "One member recalled that in 2021 the global economy shifted from a partial shutdown of activities to a scenario of expansion, with disruptions in the production processes.",
        "Another member pointed out that some leading indicators suggest that, at the beginning of 2022, tertiary activities moderated, while industrial activities recovered gradually, although in emerging economies said sector stopped expanding.",
        "He/she stated that, according to the latest projections of the International Monetary Fund, weakness of economic activity at the beginning of the year might be attenuated starting from the second quarter, once the Omicron wave loses strength and economic activity starts to normalize.",
        "He/she noted that some indices related to back orders, new orders and delivery times have improved at the margin.",
        "The majority of members highlighted that the world growth outlook for 2022 has been revised downwards.",
        "Some members stated that this was due to the expectation of lower fiscal and monetary stimuli, especially in the United States.",
        "One member added the higher number of infections and the persistence of disruptions in supply chains.",
        "Another member indicated that these disruptions will possibly dissipate by the end of the year.",
        "Some members considered that the main risks to the global economy are those associated with the pandemic.",
        "One member underlined the high inflation levels and their persistence.",
        "Another member noted that, in economies with a fragile and incomplete recovery, the tightening of monetary conditions represents a risk to growth, employment, and macroeconomic stability.",
        "Some members pointed out that the balance of risks for the global economy is biased to the downside.",
        "Most members mentioned that world inflation originated by bottlenecks in production, the reallocation of spending towards merchandise, and high commodity prices, in particular of food and energy products.",
        "One member stated that some of these prices have reached all-time highs and that they are expected to continue rising, while another member mentioned that, based on food and energy futures’ markets, these prices are anticipated to decline slowly within one year.",
        "One member pointed out that disruptions in global value chains have contributed to the higher prices of industrial inputs and have reduced their availability, as in the case of semiconductors.",
        "Another member noted that high inflation could also be the result of wage-related pressures and high transportation costs.",
        "One member pointed out that sea freight costs are at unprecedented levels and act as a negative supply shock, raising costs and generating substitution effects that generalize the pressures towards other goods.",
        "Some members noted that inflation is well above the targets of most central banks.",
        "One member mentioned that, although inflation is expected to decline during the year, its convergence would be slower as compared to what was foreseen in December, especially for developed economies.",
        "Most members stated that short-term inflation economies.",
        "One member indicated that, despite remaining at levels below those of observed inflation, inflation expectations have been deteriorating and the implicit breakeven inflation rate remains high.",
        "Some members noted that longer-term inflation expectations drawn from financial instruments registered moderate changes.",
        "One member considered that inflation remains transitory and will begin to decline once the pandemic-related disruptions are resolved.",
        "Another member considered that pandemic-related shocks have turned out to be more profound and longer-lasting than previously anticipated.",
        "He/she delved into how the amount of slack in advanced economies has decreased, in view of a solid labor demand and a slow recovery of labor participation.",
        "He/she added that this could lead to wage-related pressures, which, along with an upward revision in inflation expectations, increases the risk of a more persistent inflationary process.",
        "One member listed among risks to the price formation process the sustainability of public and private finances, geopolitical tensions, and emergencies associated with climate change.",
        "Most members pointed out that faster reductions worldwide.",
        "The majority of members mentioned economies have already started to withdraw their monetary stimuli.",
        "However, one member added that, so far, most of them maintain highly accommodative policy stances.",
        "He/she recalled that central banks of advanced economies reduced their policy rates aggressively in 2020, while during 2021 they remained patient and kept rates at historically low levels.",
        "He/she considered that this can be explained by their diagnosis about inflation not changing fundamentally.",
        "All members mentioned that, in its latest monetary policy decision, the Federal Reserve announced that it will continue reducing the pace of its asset purchases, and that it will soon increase the target range for the federal funds rate.",
        "One member stated that the balance sheet reduction could begin in the middle of this year.",
        "Most members added that the market is anticipating the first increase to the target range in March.",
        "One member pointed out that the pace and the speed of such increments could exceed those originally estimated.",
        "Another member noted that, given the economy’s strength and the high levels of inflation, the Federal Reserve’s current monetary cycle is expected to be faster than the previous one.",
        "One member mentioned that the Federal Reserve has been cautious about its communication and has reiterated that the adjustment will be gradual, which implies that it will seek to avoid surprising the markets.",
        "Another member pointed out that although the decisions of that central bank have been well communicated, orderly and predictable, currently there is less guidance that allows foreknowledge of the magnitude and pace of the cycle.",
        "Some members underlined that the Bank of England once again increased its reference rate and that the European Central Bank is preparing to tighten its monetary policy stance.",
        "One member added that the Bank of Canada is also preparing to do so.",
        "Most members noted that the central banks of various emerging market economies continued increasing their reference rates.",
        "One member pointed out that in their latest meetings they did so at an accelerated pace.",
        "Another member stated that many economies are expected to increase their reference rates to maintain financial stability and to avoid significant exchange rate depreciations.",
        "One member added that only the People’s Bank of China will maintain a more accommodative policy stance, due to a more marked moderation of its economic activity, the instability in its real estate sector, and the high levels of debt of its provinces.",
        "Most members highlighted that interest rates for all terms have increased worldwide.",
        "Some members noted that most economies exhibited a flattening of their yield curve.",

        "Another member added that risk premia have increased.",
        "Some members noted that stock markets in emerging economies registered gains, in part, due to the undervaluation they registered during the previous months.",

        "Most members mentioned that, from November to January headline inflation decreased mainly due to the deceleration of the non-core component.",
        "Some members noted that said deceleration is largely explained by the reduction in the inflation of energy and agricultural and livestock products’ prices.",
        "One member highlighted, however, that the non-core component has posted double-digit annual increases.",
        "He/she said that this reflects the high levels of both energy and agricultural and livestock product prices.",
        "Another member mentioned that, in general, pressures on food prices have increased, with a larger number of them registering double-digit annual variations.",
        "He/she added that this has occurred despite the fact that the exchange rate and the international prices of food commodities have exhibited a better performance, which suggests that there is a significant lag between these variables and food prices in Mexico, which makes these pressures recede slowly and thus they may be synchronized with new shocks.",
        "Finally, one member pointed out that given the high volatility levels and the random behavior of the non-core component, the observed decline cannot be taken as a permanent improvement given the current inflationary pressures.",

        "One member indicated that, although part of the initial increase in merchandise inflation was due to changes in the relative prices of merchandise with respect to services, the concurrence of additional shocks and their persistence have generated a high inertia in this component.",
        "Another member stated that the pressures that continue to be observed within food merchandise are associated with the behavior of prices of products derived from soybeans, corn and wheat.",
        "He/she underlined that price variations in nonfood merchandise prices are also relevant and that they have taken place along with recent upward variations in the prices of education services, and more persistently, in those of food services.",
        "One member mentioned that services inflation has followed an upward trend as a result of the reopening of activities, the increase in their demand, and vaccinations.",
        "He/she noted that inflation of services excluding housing and education exceeded 6% in January.",
        "Another member pointed out that, unlike other countries, core inflation in Mexico includes food merchandise, which tends to be volatile and highly susceptible to supply shocks.",
        "Therefore, he/she suggested focusing on the alternative core index Banco de México has used in other occasions, which includes merchandise and services, but excludes food merchandise.",
        "Regarding this index, he/she highlighted that: i) its annual inflation rate is 100 basis points below that of traditional core inflation; ii) it has remained more stable in recent months, while the traditional one has increased; and iii) pressures at the margin for this index decreased significantly in January, when annualized monthly inflation was close to its historical average.",

        "One member added that although the ten-year inflation risk premium apparently is decreasing, it remains at levels similar to those recorded in stress episodes.",
        "Another member underlined that the higher levels of inflation risk premia implicit in market instruments reflect a greater risk of long-term expectations becoming unanchored.",
        "However, one member noted that expectations drawn from market instruments for the 6-10 year average stood at 3.07% in January.",

        "One member stated that the forecasts have repeatedly undershot when anticipating the trajectory of inflation given the continuous appearance of unexpected shocks.",
        "Thus, he/she pointed out that the convergence of the core component will depend on the absence of additional shocks, which he/she considered is a strong assumption given the high levels of oil, commodities, sea freight and food prices.",
        "He/she mentioned that the shocks that have affected core inflation are expected to continue at least until the second half of 2022, and that its components most susceptible to shocks related to energy prices and the exchange rate will remain under pressure.",
        "Another member noted that inflation forecasts have continued to be revised upwards since the current tightening cycle began in June to reach its highest point in the first quarter of 2022, as the inflationary shocks that were observed in the same period of the previous year begin to fade.",
        "He/she added that, from then onward, it is expected to decline steadily in part because of the lesser pressures that the non-core component has been subject to, which tend to affect core inflation with some lag.",
        "He/she pointed out that this is expected to take place mainly through food merchandise prices, which would reflect the lower pressures on agricultural input prices.",

        "He/she added that this process is expected to continue and contribute to further declines in inflation.",
        "Among upward risks to inflation, most members highlighted cost-related pressures and the persistence of core inflation at high levels.",
        "Some members added external inflationary pressures, exchange rate depreciation, and increases in energy prices.",
        "One member stated that, insofar as the pandemic transitions to a more favorable stage, there could be a reallocation of spending towards services, which could exert pressure on service prices.",
        "Another member noted the risk of continuing imbalances between supply and demand, due to rigidities in production or the evolution of the pandemic.",
        "Some members mentioned that there is a positive correlation between the level of inflation and its persistence, and thus high levels of inflation carry the risk of the price formation process becoming contaminated.",
        "One member added the risk of wage revisions being influenced by observed inflation and by minimum wage increases.",
        "Among downward risks, another member mentioned: i) a greater-thanexpected effect from the negative output gap, ii) social distancing measures, and iii) exchange rate appreciation.",
        "Most members stated that the balance of risks for inflation within the forecast horizon remains biased to the upside.",
        "One member highlighted that the balance of risks has continued to deteriorate.",
        "Most members mentioned that the exchange rate appreciated and interest rates increased, mainly short-term ones.",
        "Some members noted that, in general, domestic financial markets performed favorably, in line with what was observed in Latin America.",

        "One member considered that this reduces the vulnerability of the peso.",
        "Another member added the fiscal balance and the level of international reserves.",
        "One member considered necessary to maintain a solid macroeconomic stance, procuring a low and stable inflation and the soundness of the financial system, given the country’s high degree of trade and financial integration with the rest of the world and its exposure to external shocks.",
        "He/she added that this is essential given the outlook of a further monetary tightening worldwide.",
        "Most members highlighted the weakness of credit to firms.",
        "Some members considered that this obeys to structural demand factors, which reflects the deterioration of investment climate.",
        "One member underlined that this is unrelated to the current monetary policy stance.",
        "Another member emphasized that financing to the non-financial private sector continued to moderate its contraction.",
        "He/she stated that, in 2021, external sources of financing registered a negative balance for the first time in 12 years, while domestic sources rebounded due to increases in the reference rate.",
        "He/she mentioned that mortgage lending displays an upward trend.",
        "One member stated that monthly variations of credit to the private sector have finally started to be positive towards the end of last year.",
        "However, he/she considered that this improvement is not enough and is at risk due to the interest rate increases, which would have an impact on the demand for credit.",
        "He/she pointed out that during the fourth quarter of 2021, the annual flow of domestic financing to the private sector accounted for 1.1% of GDP, in contrast to the 3.2% recorded in 2017, prior to the tightening of monetary conditions in Mexico.",
        "The Governing Board evaluated the magnitude and diversity of the shocks that have affected inflation and its determinants, along with the risk of medium- and long-term inflation expectations and price formation becoming contaminated, as well as the additional challenges posed by the ongoing tightening of global monetary and considerations, on this occasion, the majority decided to increase the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 50 basis points to 6.00%.",
        "Most members highlighted that, with this action, the monetary policy stance adjusts to the trajectory required for inflation to converge to its 3% target within the forecast horizon.",
        "They expressed that for the next monetary policy decisions, the Board will monitor thoroughly inflationary pressures as well as all factors that have an incidence on the foreseen path for inflation and its expectations.",
        "The latter, in order to set a policy rate that is consistent at all times with both an orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to the 3% target and an adequate adjustment of the economy and One member highlighted that, in contrast to other economies, Mexico provided a reduced monetary stimulus in 2020 and started to withdraw it early in that Mexico's monetary policy stance is currently among the least accommodative among emerging market economies, surpassed only by economies with geopolitical conflicts or deteriorated macroeconomic fundamentals.",
        "He/she considered that, given the mandate of price stability, an increase in the reference rate is justified, especially to preserve financial stability.",
        "However, he/she mentioned that the concern is whether to raise it by arguments for accelerating the monetary tightening.",
        "First, the real interest rate has not changed significantly despite the previous increases to the reference rate.",
        "In this regard, he/she pointed out that these increases created the expectation of a more permanent inflation, and therefore did not affect the real interest rate.",
        "Second, as to the Federal Reserve's adjustments possibly being greater than anticipated, he/she highlighted that said central bank has reiterated that it will adjust its rates gradually.",
        "He/she stated that, if the adjustment were greater than expected, given that Banco de México makes its decisions in calendar dates close to those of the Federal Reserve, there would be time to react and in this regard he/she considered unnecessary to act ahead or over-react to that central bank’s actions.",
        "He/she added that, given its robust macroeconomic stance, Mexico is in a better position to face the Fed’s restrictive cycle.",
        "Third, he/she mentioned that although other emerging economies have increased their reference rates at a quick pace, the relevant variable is the interest rate level and that Mexico continues having one of the highest among these economies.",
        "He/she noted that, in other economies, the greater adjustment is due to the fact that they reduced them more markedly in the past or because they face idiosyncratic problems.",
        "He/she mentioned that the current inflationary phenomenon is mostly explained by factors linked to the evolution of the pandemic and that, in the face of these exogenous pressures, there is not much that a more restrictive monetary policy stance can do.",
        "He/she added that the cost associated with a higher rate must be considered, as there is the risk of reaching a restrictive policy stance too soon, thus affecting the economic recovery.",
        "He/she mentioned that this would generate greater risk aversion and macroeconomic instability, which could translate into exchange rate- and price-related pressures, making it difficult to achieve Banco de México's objective.",
        "He/she stated that the central bank’s actions and the way it communicates them affect both expectations and the price formation process.",
        "Another member considered that some readings on inflation and its expectations have started to move in the right direction.",
        "However, he/she noted that it is still necessary to strengthen the downward trajectory of inflation, given that pressures have not dissipated, and to make the balance of risks to inflation more neutral and symmetric around the medium-term forecasts.",
        "He/she stated that there is empirical evidence of a positive correlation between high levels of inflation and its degree of persistence, and therefore if price variations do not begin to revert, there is the risk of inflation becoming more persistent.",
        "He/she considered that, throughout this inflationary episode, inflation expectations have been more sensitive by incorporating increases when observed inflation has been higher than expected, but have reacted less when it has decreased for some months, which in his/her opinion suggests that monetary policy should support more decisively the decline in inflation.",
        "He/she mentioned that the fact that the real ex-ante interest rate has increased since the last meeting indicates that the stance adopted by Banco de México is consistent with its mandate, but added that it is necessary to continue in this direction in order to influence short- and long-term expectations.",
        "He/she stated that, in view of the Federal Reserve's announced cycle of monetary normalization, the decisions taken by Banco de México since last year place our country in a relatively solid monetary position compared to that of the United States, and such position is close to reaching, both in nominal and real terms, the largest spread observed in the last cycle.",
        "He/she argued that, under different macroeconomic metrics, Mexico is well positioned with respect to previous monetary cycles, and thus it must not assume a mechanical rule with respect to the Federal Reserve's adjustments, but rather act by assessing all the information available at each moment in time.",
        "He/she considered that Banco de México faces a scenario of slow economic recovery and persistent inflation, especially in its core component, which represents a complex combination.",
        "He/she mentioned that maintaining a robust monetary policy stance in the face of persistent inflation will allow to better address the challenges ahead and thus fulfill the constitutional mandate of price stability.",
        "One member highlighted that core inflation was again higher than anticipated in January, that medium-term expectations were revised upwards, and that the new forecast trajectory for inflation was above that previously published.",
        "He/she warned that current inflation is not a temporary phenomenon focused on the prices of certain CPI items and that, if the policy response is not decisive, there is the risk of having a more persistent inflationary episode and of long-term expectations becoming unanchored, which would reduce the effectiveness of the expectations channel, which is the most relevant channel for monetary policy.",
        "He/she considered that given the continuing emergence of unanticipated shocks, the adjustments prescribed by the monetary models have not been sufficient to attain the convergence to the inflation target.",
        "He/she highlighted that, so far, given the continuous increase in expected inflation, the reference rate increases have been neutralized in the ex-ante real interest rate.",
        "He/she stated that, in his/her opinion, the dilemma is between maintaining the current pace of increase at 50 basis points or raising it to 75 basis points.",
        "He/she considered that the decision should seek a balance among three factors: high levels of inflation that are not receding, which is the primary factor, the imminent interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve, and the adverse cyclical conditions of the economy.",
        "He/she noted that, although Banco de México started the cycle a little earlier and from a less expansionary level than most central banks, if it does not accelerate the monetary tightening, it will be overtaken by most of them, since some countries have raised their rates at a triple-digit pace in their last meetings, and intend to maintain said pace.",
        "He/she argued that a pace of adjustment must be adopted in order to synchronize the domestic and global monetary cycles.",
        "The relative monetary policy stance must be adjusted cautiously in terms of margin of maneuver with regards to possible deviations from the cycle of rate increases by the Federal Reserve, in order to address, in a nonmechanical way, the short- and medium-term inflationary effects and the equilibrium of the abovementioned factors.",
        "He/she added that, although the cyclical position of the economy seems to provide some room to maneuver, core inflation remains on a strong upward trend.",
        "He/she stressed that the main challenge is to control core inflation, which is above 6%, remains on an inertial upward trajectory, and is persistent.",
        "He/she underlined that actions must be taken to maintain long-term expectations anchored and Banco de México’s credibility about its commitment to its primary objective of price stability.",
        "He/she considered that lessons from recent experience are that the monetary astringency necessary to anchor expectations and ensure compliance with the price stability mandate should not be underestimated, and that achieving that objective is the best social contribution to the country, since neglecting it would imply regressive effects on the most vulnerable population.",
        "dilemma in the face of historically and persistently high levels of inflation, especially in its core component, in a complex international environment and with an economy that contracted during the third and fourth quarters of 2021.",
        "He/she noted that the appropriate pace at which to reduce monetary stimulus must be assessed to ensure an orderly convergence to the target.",
        "He/she underlined four factors to act decisively.",
        "First, recent analyses suggest that the presence of a possible inflationary inertia may lead to an unanchoring of expectations.",
        "He/she indicated that this could occur if inflation is systematically above forecasts and these tend to be revised upwards, as has occurred previously.",
        "Second, monetary policy actions have not achieved the desired effect on the real interest rate.",
        "He/she argued that underestimating future inflation systematically leads to lower real interest rates than those consistent with the disinflationary process, which implies maintaining higher real rates in the future and for a longer period of time.",
        "Third, a balance of risks to inflation that is clearly biased to the upside.",
        "Fourth, the risks to global financial stability that have increased with the confirmation of the tightening cycle in the United States.",
        "He/she added that the increase in slack conditions does not justify a moderation in the monetary policy stance because the limited impulse that could be achieved would not offset the cost of expectations becoming unanchored, which would imply a more aggressive adjustment in the future, with higher costs for the population.",
        "He/she warned that the deterioration of the inflationary outlook has increased the risk of delaying the convergence of inflation to the target, thus affecting price dynamics.",
        "He/she expressed that an increase of 50 basis points to the reference rate would contribute to maintain consistency between the communication regarding the primary objective and the actions to achieve it.",
        "He/she pointed out that these actions are intended to strengthen the expectations channel and limit demand pressures.",
        "He/she added that this measure places the central bank in a better position to face more astringent global financial conditions.",
        "He/she considered it fundamental for the monetary policy statement to mention that the balance of risks for inflation has continued to deteriorate, and that it restates the central bank’s commitment to price stability.",
        "Finally, he/she recalled that the greatest contribution that the central bank can make to foster sustained growth and increase the population’s welfare is to guarantee compliance with its constitutional mandate.",
        "He/she highlighted that, with these actions, it is possible to lay the foundations of stability and confidence necessary to promote investment and a better allocation of resources in the economy.",
        "One member noted that Banco de México has faced an unprecedented environment, in which atypical, deep and widespread shocks derived from the pandemic have posed significant challenges for the fulfillment of its mandate to safeguard the stability of the currency's purchasing power.",
        "He/she stated that the main challenge is that world inflation has reached levels unseen in decades.",
        "He/she argued that, given the social and economic costs derived from high inflation, which affect the lower-income population to a greater extent, monetary policy must continue focusing on consolidating an environment of low and stable inflation.",
        "He/she stated that allowing inflation to remain at high levels, considering that inflation expectations might continue to be affected, could erode monetary policy’s credibility, posing an obstacle for the convergence of inflation to the target, and affecting domestic financial markets and economic activity.",
        "He/she considered that in the current scenario, the central bank's commitment to fulfilling its mandate should be strengthened.",
        "He/she mentioned that the monetary policy response must be consistent with the convergence of inflation to its target in the forecast horizon and should seek to keep inflation expectations anchored.",
        "He/she considered that Banco de México’s communication should provide certainty that the necessary actions will be taken so that the price formation process is not contaminated.",
        "He/she argued that the above, in addition to having a favorable impact on the convergence of inflation to its target, will contribute to induce orderly conditions in the foreign exchange and fixed income markets, in an environment where the international monetary cycle might generate volatility.",
        "He/she added that the outlook for monetary policy has become more complex, given the outlook for a faster withdrawal of monetary stimulus around the world, particularly in the United States.",
        "He/she pointed out that the upcoming decisions should consider, as the Governing Board has been doing, the evolution of all inflation determinants, including inflation expectations, especially longer-term ones, cost-related pressures, slack conditions, the evolution of financial markets, and international monetary policy.",
        "He/she expressed that the evolution of the shocks that have exerted pressures on inflation must be considered, evaluating whether they are starting to mitigate as economic conditions normalize and, at the same time, monitoring the risk of new shocks arising or the effects of those already observed becoming amplified.",
        "The Governing Board evaluated the magnitude and diversity of the shocks that have affected inflation and its determinants, along with the risk of mediumand long-term inflation expectations and price formation becoming contaminated, as well as the additional challenges posed by the ongoing tightening of global monetary and financial conditions.",
        "Based on these considerations, on this occasion, the Board decided to increase the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 50 basis points to 6.00%.",
        "With this action, the monetary policy stance adjusts to the trajectory required for inflation to converge to its 3% target within the forecast horizon.",

        "He/she underlined that the headline inflation forecast for said quarter was revised upwards by over 100 basis points.",

        "Among downward risks, some members pointed to the possibility that the Policy Program to Fight Inflation and High Prices (PACIC, for its acronym in Spanish) will have a greater-thananticipated effect, while one member stated that its impact would be marginal and would be mainly associated with the gasoline subsidy.",
        "He/she underlined that the viability of this measure will depend on whether it can be financed without affecting the fiscal balance.",
        "Another member mentioned, among downward risks, the following: i) a decline in the intensity of the military conflict; ii) an improvement in supply chains; and iii) a greater-thanexpected effect from the negative output gap.",
        "One member stated that the withdrawal of fiscal and monetary stimuli at the global level would contribute to mitigate inflationary pressures worldwide and, consequently, domestic ones.",
        "Another member stressed that it is worrying that conjunctural risks, such as climate-related factors, logistical problems and input costs, showed a greater deterioration than that perceived during previous inflation episodes, which suggests a concurrence of risks greater than previously observed.",

        "They highlighted that the exchange rate showed an considered that its trading conditions deteriorated somewhat at the margin.",
        "Some members recognized that the exchange rate depreciated slightly.",
        "However, they pointed out its resilience, given the country’s sound macroeconomic fundamentals and the broad volatility-adjusted interest rate spread relative to the United States.",
        "One member added that its favorable behavior is also due to lower idiosyncratic risks relative to other economies in the region.",
        "Another member noted that so far this year the Mexican peso has appreciated slightly.",
        "One member pointed out that forward-looking indicators for the Mexican peso show improvements both according to market metrics and analysts’ expectations.",

        "Some members pointed out that the stock market registered a decline of more than 2%.",
        "One member expressed the need, in this context of high risks and high uncertainty, for the economies characterized by a high degree of financial and commercial integration with the rest of the world, and that are exposed to external shocks, to maintain a solid macroeconomic policy stance at all times.",
        "He/she pointed out that, within the scope of Banco de México’s attributions, this implies pursuing low and stable inflation and safeguarding the strength of the financial system.",
        "He/she underlined that the relative monetary policy stance is appropriate, which along with solid macroeconomic fundamentals, such as fiscal discipline and sustainable external accounts, allows the economy to face possible negative external shocks.",

        "Based on these considerations, all members voted for raising the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 75 basis points to 7.75%.",
        "Most members emphasized that, with this action, the monetary policy stance adjusts to the trajectory required for inflation to converge to its 3% target within The Governing Board expressed that it will thoroughly monitor inflationary pressures as well as all factors that have an incidence on the foreseen path for inflation and its expectations.",

        "The Board added that for the following monetary policy decisions, it intends to continue increasing the reference rate and will evaluate taking the same One member considered that the recent monetary policy decision of the Federal Reserve and the recent volatility in global financial markets lead to a proportional response in order to preserve the relative monetary policy stance, promoting stability in domestic markets.",
        "Likewise, he/she considered that looking forward, the absolute stance will be increasingly important and the relative stance will be less so.",
        "He/she argued that this is because, first, the current decision places the real interest rate above the level considered as neutral, and second, there is enough space for an eventual reduction of the spread between the reference rates in Mexico and in the US.",
        "He/she emphasized the importance of a gradual transition to a moderately restrictive absolute stance in order to prevent the current inflationary phenomenon from generating second-round effects on the price formation process, but stressed also the importance of avoiding an excessive tightening.",
        "He/she pointed out that the real interest rate, which for Mexico is among the highest in the world, affects different variables, such as credit, investment and durable goods’ consumption.",
        "He/she forewarned that it is necessary to avoid an excessive tightening, which may result counterproductive even to preserve macroeconomic and financial stability, and therefore, to control inflation.",
        "He/she considered that the increase observed in emerging economies’ risk premia is associated with the deterioration in their economic outlook and in their public finances, which partly derives from monetary tightening and reflects the limits of monetary policy to preserve macroeconomic stability in emerging economies.",
        "He/she mentioned, as additional reasons, that the inflation rebound is caused by global factors and thus an excessive tightening in Mexico would bring little gains in terms of controlling domestic inflation, and that unlike other countries that provided ample fiscal and monetary stimuli, Mexico does not register an out-of-control growth of aggregate demand.",
        "He/she mentioned that during the following quarter, there may be conditions to begin dissociating from the pace of the Federal Reserve’s rate increases, given that: i) the volatility adjusted interest rate spread relative to the United States is among the highest in the emerging economies and is at all-time highs; ii) from a medium-term perspective, the Mexican peso stands out for its sound performance and low volatility, which reflects solid macroeconomic fundamentals; iii) Mexico began its normalization process earlier and is closer to the zone considered as restrictive; iv) unlike other emerging economies and the United States, Mexico does not face demand- or labor market-related inflationary pressures; and v) inflation in Mexico is less distant from its target, as compared to other countries.",
        "Another member mentioned that given the deterioration in the balance of risks and the persistence of high inflation levels, this decision, rather than a change in the pace, will give the necessary boost to attain an interest rate trajectory consistent with the convergence of inflation to its target.",
        "He/she underlined that, although the monetary policy adjustments that have been implemented allow the relative position with the United States to be solid, given the recent, larger than expected increase in the reference rate of the United States, and given tighter financial conditions worldwide, as well as an increase of perceived risk aversion, the relative monetary policy stance must be thoroughly monitored, while inflationary pressures persist.",
        "In this regard, he/she mentioned that the shocks associated with the armed conflict continue affecting commodity prices, while the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in China and the subsequent restrictions to mobility continue affecting the reestablishment of supply chains, and it remains unclear if they could be lifted in the short-term.",
        "He/she considered that it is inevitable to act forcefully to address the inflationary pressures that are perceived in the convergence trajectory of inflation to its target and which have caused a deterioration in the inflation forecasts, although the period of convergence remains constant.",
        "He/she underlined that given the lag at which monetary policy operates, the ex-ante real interest rate may need to lie above the upper threshold of the range for the neutral rate for the stance to be more effective.",
        "He/she added that looking ahead, it is necessary to carefully assess if another increase of a similar magnitude is necessary which would ensure the anchoring of inflation expectations, allow the ex-ante real rate to adjust more efficiently as compared to the expected inflation trajectory and prevent the emergence of second-round effects on price formation.",
        "He/she indicated that the actions taken, complemented with the adequate use of communication tools, have been more effective, and that it is important that this continues, especially in periods of high uncertainty, given that an orderly adjustment of financial markets is necessary in view of Banco de México’s decisions.",
        "One member stated that Mexico is currently facing an even more complex inflation environment.",
        "He/she forewarned that, since the last monetary policy decision, the expected inflation trajectory at year end has been revised by over 100 basis points, that the balance of risks to inflation maintains a considerable upward bias, and that the possibility that inflationary shocks will be longer-lasting, that they will intensify or that new shocks will emerge, cannot be ruled out.",
        "He/she considered that in this environment, a faster rate of tightening is urgently required to achieve a restrictive monetary policy stance.",
        "He/she added that the effects of the pandemic on world inflation, a greater international monetary tightening and the deterioration of inflation expectations, call for maintaining this rate of tightening at least during the following monetary policy decision.",
        "He/she mentioned four factors to be considered in fighting inflation.",
        "The first factor is to take the monetary stance to a restrictive region.",
        "He/she point out that although the current hiking cycle began in June 2021, inflation expectations increased, so that the monetary policy stance is barely in the lower part of the neutral range.",
        "He/she mentioned that, after the the neutral range, and, given a new possible upward revision in the expectations, this increase will not be sufficient to reach a restrictive monetary policy stance.",
        "Thus, an adjustment of a similar magnitude will be necessary in the next decision.",
        "He/she emphasized that the cyclical conditions become secondary and no effort must be spared in controlling inflation.",
        "Second, he/she noted that a necessary but not sufficient condition for inflation to decline in Mexico, is that it declines in the United States.",
        "He/she expressed that inflation in the United States reached very high levels, which pushed the Federal Reserve to increase its reference rate by 75bp.",
        "He/she pointed out that Mexico’s relative monetary policy stance has been enough to confront the episodes of higher volatility.",
        "Therefore, he/she considered that the Federal Reserve’s increase must be matched, in order to maintain the interest rate spread between the two countries.",
        "Third, the support, albeit marginal, of other efforts to reduce inflation, such as the PACIC and especially the fiscal stimulus to the price of gasoline.",
        "The fourth is characterized by a combination of patience and luck.",
        "Patience in waiting for the current shocks to dissipate and luck for new shocks not to emerge.",
        "He/she sustained that the expected inflection point in the headline and core inflation trends during the fourth quarter does not depend exclusively on Banco de México, thus it is important to remain cautious.",
        "He/she expressed the opinion that the current challenges demand a communication policy that is free of ambiguities, with precise qualitative and quantitative information about the future policy actions.",
        "Furthermore, he/she pointed out that, given that the monetary tightening works mainly through the expectations channel, it is important to have and effective communication.",
        "This opens the discussion to improve the communication strategy towards a more robust framework.",
        "He/she pointed out that some pioneering central banks have a forward guidance in which, in addition to the inflation and growth forecasts, they publish the reference rates’ trajectory, which is consistent with the inflation forecast.",
        "He/she considered that such communication policy could strengthen the monetary policy transmission.",
        "The above assuming that said trajectory would not imply a commitment regarding future decisions, but rather only a guide over its possible course.",
        "He/she noted that an explanation could be added on how this path could be changed in response to a number of events.",
        "He/she argued that measures of this kind should be thoroughly analyzed and, if implemented, it should be done in a cautious manner.",
        "Another member recalled that from the beginning of the current cycle, it was pointed out that the challenge was for inflationary pressures, which at the time where considered to be transitory and generated by supply shocks, not to affect price formation and the anchoring of expectations.",
        "He/she added that the relevance of expectations, especially those for longer terms, in monetary policy transmission, was highlighted, and that these could be affected by persistent and high levels of inflation, even in the absence of demand pressures.",
        "He/she added that it was emphasized that the central bank’s credibility helps to maintain expectations anchored and contributes to a more efficient monetary policy.",
        "He/she pointed out that twelve months later, there are high levels of inflation, unseen in more than 20 years, a generalized inflationary phenomenon which affects a large number of goods and services, and which has shown resistance to decline despite the adjustments in the monetary policy stance, and the most concerning, the beginning of the unanchoring of medium- and long-term expectations.",
        "He/she highlighted that all of this has taken place despite two factors that have contributed to reduce additional inflationary pressures: a flexible and resilient exchange rate, which has allowed the economy to absorb part of the pass-through of external inflation, and the energy price policy implemented by the Federal Government to limit their increase in real terms.",
        "He/she considered that it is essential to take firm and forceful actions to restore confidence in the commitment to convergence to the target within the forecast horizon.",
        "He/she considered it necessary to take the reference rate to restrictive territory, and that increasing the rate of adjustment of monetary policy cannot be postponed.",
        "He/she argued that regarding the expectations channel, there are studies that show that, even in the face of supply shocks, reference rate increases contribute to mitigate the effects on longterm expectations.",
        "He/she added that in the face of inflationary pressures from abroad, a 75 bp increase would also reinforce the exchange rate channel.",
        "He/she considered it fundamental that communication allows the anticipation of the more restrictive monetary conditions needed to achieve the convergence of inflation to the target, given the growing risks to price stability.",
        "He/she expressed that only with the proposed increase and anticipating more restrictive monetary conditions can the central bank’s commitment to its constitutional mandate be endorsed and the anchoring of inflation expectations guaranteed.",
        "He/she argued that the way to induce lower interest rates in the future, as well as an expansion of financing and credit, to the benefit of economic activity and employment, is precisely by raising the reference rate in a timely and sufficient manner, and by avoiding more severe rate increases in the future.",
        "He/she warned that, if this is not done, the social cost in terms of production and employment will undoubtedly be much higher.",
        "He/she stated that the main current challenge is the high level of inflation.",
        "One member considered that monetary policy in Mexico has continued to face a highly complex environment.",
        "Given the high social and economic costs derived from inflation, and given that these affect the most vulnerable population to a greater extent, it is essential to act with the necessary determination to achieve low and stable inflation.",
        "He/she argued that the confluence of factors, such as those associated with the pandemic and the geopolitical conflict, among others, has led to a generalized inflationary shock of great magnitude, which could have long-term effects on the dynamics of inflation in Mexico and he/she added that, in such an environment, the possibility of price formation contamination may increase.",
        "He/she warned that an unanchoring of inflation expectations, mainly of those for longer terms, would make convergence to the target more difficult.",
        "He/she pointed out that international monetary and financial conditions are in circumstances unseen in several decades, especially in terms of the Federal Reserve's pace of monetary tightening, which could have significant repercussions on global and domestic financial markets, including the exchange rate, and could make it difficult to control inflation in Mexico.",
        "In view of the deteriorating environment, it is necessary to strengthen the monetary policy stance and confirm the commitment that the necessary actions will be taken so that inflation expectations remain anchored and a deterioration of the price formation process is avoided.",
        "He/she expressed that, at the present juncture, there must not be any doubt about the central bank’s determination to achieve the convergence of inflation to the target within the forecast horizon.",
        "This, considering that it is important to address the described scenario in a decisive manner, in order to comply with Banco de México’s obligation with the Mexican population.",
        "He/she stated that, looking ahead, the evolution of all inflation determinants should continue to be considered, including inflation expectations, especially longer-term ones, slack conditions and the evolution of financial markets as well as the relative monetary policy stance.",
        "He/she considered that in the next monetary policy decisions, Banco de México should continue the cycle of reference rate increases, assessing whether it is necessary to take the same forceful measures based on the outlook for inflation and its expectations.",
        "All of the above, in order for Banco de México to adopt the necessary actions to comply with its constitutional mandate of maintaining low and stable inflation.",
        "The Governing Board evaluated the magnitude and diversity of the shocks that have affected inflation and its determinants, along with the risk of contamination of medium- and long-term inflation expectations and of the price formation process.",
        "It also considered the increasing challenges for monetary policy stemming from the ongoing tightening of global financial conditions, the environment of significant uncertainty, and inflationary pressures associated with the geopolitical conflict and with the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in China, as well as the possibility of greater effects on inflation.",
        "Based on these considerations, and with the presence of all its members, the Board decided unanimously to raise the target for the overnight interbank interest rate, on this occasion, by 75 basis points to 7.75%.",
        "With this action, the monetary policy stance adjusts to the trajectory required for inflation to converge to its 3% target within the forecast horizon.",
        "The Board will monitor thoroughly inflationary pressures as well as all factors that have an incidence on the foreseen path for inflation and its expectations.",
        "This, in order to set a policy rate that is consistent at all times with the trajectory needed to facilitate the orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to the 3% target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates as well as an adequate adjustment of the economy and financial markets.",
        "For the next policy decisions, the Board intends to continue raising the reference rate and will evaluate taking the same forceful measures if conditions so require.",
        "Victoria Rodríguez, Galia Borja, Irene Espinosa, Gerardo Esquivel and Jonathan Heath voted in favor of increasing the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 75 basis points to 7.75%."

        "Based on the above, and taking into consideration the monetary persistence of the shocks that the Mexican economy is facing, with the presence of all its members, the Board decided unanimously to maintain the target for the overnight interbank interest rate at 11.25%.",
        "With this decision, the monetary policy stance remains in the trajectory required for inflation to converge to its 3% target The Board will thoroughly monitor inflationary pressures as well as all factors that have an incidence on the foreseen path for inflation and its expectations.",
        "It considers that, in order to achieve an orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to the 3% target, the reference rate must be maintained at its current level for some time.",

        "He/she deemed it prudent to emphasize in the monetary policy statement the need for the reference rate to remain at its current level for some time in order for inflation to converge to the target.",
        "He/she underlined that, while the nominal rate has remained unchanged since March expectations, the ex-ante real interest rate continued increasing as required by the complex inflationary environment, and its whole distribution lies clearly in restrictive territory.",
        "He/she added that, during the same period, the disinflation process continued making significant progress.",
        "He/she pointed out that since march headline inflation declined by about 250 basis points, and core inflation by 280 points.",

        "He/she pointed out that headline inflation is still above the foreseen trajectory remains biased to the upside.",
        "In this context, he/she mentioned that, during the meetings of the first quarter of 2024, caution must be exercised when evaluating the possibility of lowering the reference rate.",
        "He/she indicated that a cautious approach implies that, when macroeconomic conditions allow, downward adjustments should be gradual, and decisions be such that the monetary policy stance remains solid to achieve the convergence of inflation to the target.",
        "He/she stated that the prevailing level of monetary restriction will be weighed against further decreases in inflation, its levels at that time, its outlook, as well as that of its determinants.",
        "He/she explained that all of this will imply monitoring a wide range of variables, and that decisions made at the time will be data-dependent.",
        "He/she reiterated that, in compliance with the primary mandate of Banco de México, monetary policy’s priority is to reduce inflation levels and consolidate an environment of low and stable inflation to the benefit of Mexico’s population.",
        "Another member expressed that there are still risk factors that could hinder the foreseen trajectory of inflation towards the 3% target, which could complicate the conduction of monetary policy next year.",
        "He/she highlighted the possibility that the resilience of economic activity continues through the horizon of monetary policy planning, the cyclical position of the economy in positive and increasing territory, that the labor market remains tight and does not show signs of easing, the persistence of core inflation, inflation expectations that are not declining to the required levels, and the procyclical fiscal policy.",
        "He/she added that new episodes of peso depreciation could occur and affect inflation, in case of adjustments in expectations regarding the Federal Reserve’s actions.",
        "He/she also mentioned the high uncertainty regarding commodity prices, especially energy-related ones, as a result of a potential escalation or continuation of geopolitical conflicts.",
        "In view of the environment of high uncertainty and the risks mentioned above, he/she considered it essential to maintain the level of monetary restriction attained.",
        "Thus, he/she indicated that in this meeting the reference rate should be maintained at 11.25%.",
        "He/she argued that, in his/her opinion, monetary policy communication should maintain a cautious tone and emphasize that the balance of risks for the trajectory foreseen for inflation remains biased to the upside.",
        "Likewise, he/she considered that, given this environment, the reference rate will likely need to remain at its current level longer than expected by markets.",
        "As a result of the above, he/she emphasized that a data-dependent approach should continue to be followed, allowing flexibility in future decisions and avoiding any sign of complacency, as the outlook can change rapidly due to both external and domestic factors.",
        "He/she concluded that the Mexican economy has a high exposure to both external and domestic risks, and the materialization of these risks would further deteriorate the already complex inflation outlook and affect monetary policy implementation.",
        "Under these conditions, he/she expressed that now more than ever a message of prudence and caution must be conveyed.",
        "One member argued that, despite the strong monetary restriction implemented for over a year, economic activity remains robust, bank lending is growing in real terms, and risks to inflation remain biased to the upside.",
        "Thus, the inflationary problem continues.",
        "He/she mentioned that the economy’s cyclical position requires a restrictive policy stance.",
        "He/she argued that certain idiosyncratic factors hinder the transmission of the restrictive policy stance, such as the lack of synchronization between fiscal and monetary policies.",
        "He/she also mentioned structural factors such as low levels of financial depth, low credit penetration, high levels of informality, and lack of competition in both the financial system and other sectors.",
        "He/she stated that the latter allows an environment of high margins by firms.",
        "Given the above, he/she considered that the reference rate should be maintained at 11.25% in this monetary policy meeting.",
        "He/she deemed it necessary to maintain the forward guidance unchanged in this occasion in order to communicate that the reference rate will be left at that level for some time.",
        "He/she added that monetary policy must still remain restrictive for an extended period.",
        "He/she highlighted that caution and prudence should be maintained in 2024 so as to avoid a premature easing.",
        "He/she pointed out that the real ex-ante interest rate has had a tightening cycle like no other since the adoption of the inflation targeting regime.",
        "He/she stated that, since November 2021, it has increased by 671 basis points, 84 of which have occurred since March 2023 when the reference rate was set at its current level.",
        "He/she warned that such rate should not exceed the range of 7-7.5%, which he/she deemed appropriate to ensure inflation convergence.",
        "Given the risk of an excessively restrictive policy stance that could impact economic activity or financial stability, he/she noted that a finetuning adjustment to the reference rate should be considered for the end of the first quarter or during the second quarter of 2024.",
        "He/she stated that, in order to evaluate monetary policy adjustments at the margin, it is imperative that upward risks do not materialize, that the pressures onto core inflation abate, that inflation adheres to the projected trajectory through the ongoing disinflation process, and that twelve-month inflation expectations continue declining, getting close to the target range.",
        "He/she mentioned that it should be clarified that a fine-tuning adjustment does not imply the beginning of a cycle of consecutive reference rate cuts, as the absorption of inflationary shocks, the decline in inflation, and the improvement of expectations are not continuous, constant, and homogeneous processes.",
        "He/she added that these fine-tuning adjustments would need to be implemented in a spaced, gradual, and cautious manner, which will represent the main communication challenge.",
        "Another member argued that the disinflation process advanced significantly in 2023, associated with the fading of the shocks.",
        "He/she underlined the normalization of global supply chains and the decline in commodity prices.",
        "He/she explained that this, along with the monetary policy stance adopted, led to a better balance between supply and demand in various sectors.",
        "He/she indicated that, based on the international experience, when an economy is subject to shocks of great magnitude, inflation tends to decline significantly once the impact of such disturbances dissipates.",
        "However, he/she warned that inflation moderates its pace of deceleration once the original effects of the shocks that caused the price increases fade away.",
        "In this regard, he/she stated that disinflation will be characterized by being slower, just as the latest forecasts show, and that convergence to the target still requires a tight and cautious monetary policy stance given the upward biased distribution of risks.",
        "He/she highlighted that during 2023 it was necessary to consolidate a markedly restrictive policy stance in order to anchor inflation expectations and prevent disruptions in price formation in the economy.",
        "He/she noted that the expectations channel and the exchange rate channel played a key role in allowing inflation to decline rapidly and efficiently.",
        "Nevertheless, he/she underlined that during 2024 the channels most associated with demand will likely need to play a more relevant role.",
        "He/she pointed out that the experience suggests that these channels are particularly sensitive to the duration of tight monetary conditions, since the lags with which they operate are considerably long.",
        "He/she considered that, looking ahead, the challenge will be to calibrate both the magnitude of the restriction and its duration.",
        "He/she added that the communication strategy should allow for sufficient flexibility in each policy meeting, as the materialization of risks under a rigid forward guidance approach could lead to a time inconsistency.",
        "He/she reiterated that, in view of a complex inflationary outlook, and considering the uncertainty associated with inflection points, a datadependent approach should be maintained, incorporating all available information and keeping various options on the table.",
        "He/she underlined that the monetary policy stance should be assessed according to the circumstances and prudently, in order to comply with the constitutional mandate and to ensure an orderly adjustment of the economy and of financial markets.",
        "One member considered that there are conditions to begin discussing the possibility of reference rate cuts in the next policy meetings.",
        "He/she highlighted the need to take into account the progress in the disinflationary process.",
        "He/she reiterated the significant reduction in both headline and core inflation from their peak levels.",
        "He/she added that, since March, when the reference rate reached its current level, the decline of the core component has been more evident, and remarked that during this period a passive tightening of 84 basis points has been accumulated.",
        "He/she underlined that, given the current policy stance, inflation is expected to continue trending downwards.",
        "Second, he/she pointed out that, even with reference rate cuts, the monetary policy stance will remain sufficiently solid to continue supporting the convergence of inflation.",
        "He/she noted that, although the recent inflationary episode has been atypical, the current level of the reference rate is above any historical reference, taking into account the current level of inflation.",
        "He/she specified that the current level of the reference rate is higher than the average observed during periods in which headline inflation has been between 4 and 4.5%, of 5.95% for the nominal rate, and of 2.06% for the real one.",
        "He/she pointed out that when core inflation was between 5 and 5.5%, the nominal and real rates averaged 7.28 and 2.93%, respectively.",
        "Third, he/she added that the recent dynamics of services prices responds to a necessary adjustment, after merchandise prices deviated from their long-term equilibrium relative to services prices due to the shocks faced.",
        "He/she mentioned that the absolute monetary policy stance attained is sufficiently robust to address possible changes in the relative stance.",
        "He/she also considered that some inflation determinants have improved compared to what was observed at the end of last year.",
        "He/she highlighted that the challenge ahead is to adjust the degree of monetary restriction in a non-linear disinflationary context.",
        "He/she argued that future policy meetings should assign greater weight to the already observed and expected behavior of the inflationary outlook in its entirety, including the evolution of its determinants and its balance of risks, and not rely exclusively on specific data.",
        "He/she added that it will be necessary to take into account that inflation, while remaining above target, has declined considerably.",
        "Finally, he/she estimated it pertinent to communicate that the reference rate will remain at its current level for some time and that, given the expected evolution of the overall outlook and the prevailing uncertainty, adjustments would be gradual and not necessarily continuous.",
        "The Governing Board evaluated the magnitude and diversity of the inflationary shocks and their determinants, along with the evolution of mediumand long-term inflation expectations and the price formation process.",
        "It acknowledged the progress of the disinflationary process in Mexico.",
        "Nevertheless, it estimated that the outlook is still challenging.",
        "Based on the above, and taking into consideration the monetary policy stance already attained and the persistence of the shocks that the Mexican economy is facing, with the presence of all its members, the Board decided unanimously to maintain the target for the overnight interbank interest rate at 11.25%.",
        "With this decision, the monetary policy stance remains in the trajectory required for inflation to converge to its The Board will thoroughly monitor inflationary pressures as well as all factors that have an incidence on the foreseen path for inflation and its expectations.",

        "He/she emphasized the lower-than expected growth of retail sales.",
        "He/she argued that the above could reflect the fact that consumers are more aware of a labor market that shows signs of moderation, in a context where access to credit has become more limited.",

        "Another member underlined that the level of monetary restriction attained has facilitated consistent progress in disinflation.",
        "He/she pointed out that this has been achieved through both the exchange rate and expectations channels.",
        "However, he/she emphasized that, although inflation has decreased, the balance of risks for its expected trajectory remains biased to the upside.",
        "Among main risks, he/she highlighted: i) that, despite the monetary restriction, domestic economic activity continues showing resilience and that demandrelated pressures may slow down or even reverse the fall in inflation; ii) that core inflation persists at high levels; iii) that non-core inflation stabilizes at levels higher than those estimated by Banco de México's forecasts; and iv) that a greater-thananticipated depreciation of the national currency is observed.",
        "He/she warned that the materialization of these risks could hinder the convergence of inflation to its target over the planning horizon.",

        "He/she stated that an inflation rate far from its target, a balance of risks for inflation biased to the upside, and the strength of economic activity and credit, despite a historically high ex-ante real rate, evidence that monetary policy in Mexico has had to face additional challenges, such as pressures stemming from wage increases and an expansionary fiscal policy.",
        "In this context, he/she considered that, at this moment, a reference rate cut could be interpreted by markets as Banco de México's tolerance to higher inflation levels.",
        "He/she indicated that some analysts and market participants have acknowledged that the macroeconomic environment is still uncertain to consider adjusting the level of monetary restriction.",
        "He/she noted that the consensus is that at this meeting the Governing Board will make a first cut to the reference rate.",

        "One member highlighted several factors to consider for this decision before beginning any cycle of reference rate cuts: i) that the balance of risks for inflation remains biased to the upside and is uncertain; ii) that services inflation does not show a downward trend or signs of an imminent decline soon; iii) that analysts' inflation expectations for the end of 2024 are above the central bank's forecasts, and thus they do not anticipate that the intermediate inflation target will be attained; iv) that the output gap is positive and certain indicators suggest demandrelated pressures; v) that the labor market continues showing strength; and vi) that credit growth is not slowing down, while the monetary base is growing above 14%.",
        "In this context, he/she considered that it is still not time to begin a rate cutting cycle.",
        "However, he/she expressed that there is some room for an isolated fine-tuning in order to maintain a restrictive, but not overly restrictive, monetary policy stance.",
        "He/she pointed out that since the last reference rate increase, the real ex-ante rate has risen by more than 100 basis points due to the decline in one-year inflation expectations.",
        "He/she noted that this rate, currently near 7.5%, allows some room for a 25basis-point reduction to ensure a restrictive stance within the range of 7 to 7.5%.",
        "He/she added that the interest rate spread relative to the United States provides a certain margin to set the target rate irrespective of the Federal Reserve’s anticipated monetary policy stance.",
        "He/she stated that in a context that calls for prudence, before making an additional adjustment to the reference rate, there should be greater certainty about the convergence of inflation to its target before considering a monetary easing cycle.",
        "He/she noted that a major challenge in implementing the fine tuning will be to convince markets that it is not yet time to start a cutting cycle, and thus the premature expectation by analysts that this cycle will materialize must be avoided.",
        "He/she also cautioned against comparing the current monetary policy stance with that of other episodes as each has its own difficulties, circumstances, and causes.",
        "He/she warned that, based on international evidence, the most common mistake in inflationary episodes is to begin monetary policy easing prematurely.",
        "He/she indicated that the central bank’s credibility in its commitment to its primary mandate must be maintained.",
        "He/she underlined that it must be made clear that the focus is centered on the long term.",
        "He/she expressed that it must be communicated that the decline in inflation is insufficient and that there is still a long road to be covered.",
        "He/she considered that if inflation and its expectations do not decrease in a clear and continuous manner in the coming months, the target rate should not be lowered.",
        "He/she pointed out that, in his/her opinion, monetary policy in Mexico has limited effectiveness, and thus a restrictive, elevated and lasting monetary policy stance is required.",
        "He/she warned that unlike previous episodes, this time inflationary persistence is higher.",
        "He/she added that the current global monetary conditions, the domestic economy's cyclical position, and the expansionary fiscal policy are consistent with the need for a more restrictive policy stance.",
        "Therefore, he/she argued that room to lower the target rate might be very limited.",
        "He/she finally pointed out that a firm stance must be taken in view of an uncertain inflationary outlook biased to the upside.",
        "disinflation process has continued and inflation expectations remain stable and anchored, the current situation is still uncertain.",
        "In this regard, he/she mentioned that inflation forecasts were revised marginally upwards for the next three quarters and that the balance of risks for inflation continues to be biased to the upside.",
        "He/she argued that the monetary restriction attained since September 2022 has operated with different lags in each of the transmission channels.",

        "He/she emphasized that domestic financing has recently shown some moderation in its growth rate, especially for firms, where the pass-through to financing rates has been more widespread throughout this tightening cycle.",
        "He/she estimated that the monetary policy stance will continue to be robust and will remain in restrictive territory if the reference rate is reduced by 25 basis points.",
        "He/she stated that the transmission channels will continue operating to enable the orderly and sustained convergence of inflation to the target.",
        "He/she noted that Mexico's real interest rate in relation to the inflationary gap is higher than that of most emerging countries and that its magnitude has allowed to face the inflationary challenges.",
        "He/she expressed that, given the complexity of the disinflationary process and the tight conditions in the economy, especially in the labor market, it will be necessary to maintain a restrictive stance in the forecast horizon.",
        "He/she indicated that future monetary policy actions should be dependent on incoming data and on the evolution of inflation determinants.",
        "He/she considered that the monetary policy statement should convey a cautious tone.",
        "He/she added that the proposed reduction should not be interpreted as a normalization process of monetary policy or complacency with the level of inflation, but rather as one that seeks to calibrate the current level of monetary restriction with the evolution of inflation and its outlook.",
        "He/she stated that communication should encourage markets to adjust their expectations to what is likely to be a slower and longer-lasting cycle compared to past episodes, with a clear commitment to strengthen the country's economic and financial stability.",
        "One member elaborated on the reasons he/she considers that a reduction in the reference rate is not premature.",
        "He/she highlighted the importance of making an appropriate assessment of the inflationary outlook, considering the origin of pressures, their nature, dynamics, and the road covered.",
        "He/she recalled that during 2021 and 2022 an inflationary period clearly different from the previous ones was faced, characterized by atypical shocks that led to tail risks, whose effects have been perceived in a differentiated and lagged manner.",
        "He/she highlighted that given this scenario, fifteen consecutive increases were made, accumulating historical high, and maintaining it at that level for practically one year, which represents the longest pause observed after a rate hiking cycle.",
        "He/she pointed out that, as a result of this forceful monetary policy action and the mitigation of shocks, significant progress has been made in the disinflationary process, and thus we are now in a better position.",
        "He/she also deemed necessary not only to monitor whether the balance of risks remains biased to the upside, but also its evolution in response to the mitigation of tail risks, taking into account disruptions in supply chains, supply-related pressures, or if inflation becomes entrenched at elevated levels.",

        "He/she stated that even if the rate is lowered, the monetary policy stance would remain clearly in restrictive territory, would continue exerting an influence through its channels, and would remain sufficiently robust in light of changes in the policy stance relative to other economies.",
        "He/she deemed it highly relevant that monetary policy should be implemented gradually, not only in terms of magnitude but duration.",
        "He/she considered that this is appropriate in an environment where challenges, such as the persistence of services inflation, prevail.",
        "He/she noted that gradualism in terms of duration means that one adjustment does not imply a continuous cycle has begun.",
        "He/she stated that while it is not prudent to set a specific range for the ex-ante real rate, given the challenges imposed on communication, it is appropriate to adjust its level in view of the significant improvement in the inflationary landscape and outlook, although this does not imply bringing it back to its pre-pandemic levels.",
        "Finally, he/she highlighted that the challenge ahead is to adjust the level of tightening in a way that acknowledges the significant progress in inflationary dynamics, while also addressing the challenges that still prevail on the path towards the 3% target.",
        "The Governing Board evaluated the easing of the effects of the shocks on inflation and its determinants, along with the behavior of mediumand long-term inflation expectations and the price formation process.",
        "It acknowledged the disinflationary process underway since the last time the reference rate was adjusted; nevertheless, it considered the challenges and risks that prevail, which requires monetary policy to continue being managed prudently.",
        "Based on the above, with the presence of all its members, the Board decided by majority to lower the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 25 basis points to 11.00%.",
        "With this decision, the monetary policy stance remains restrictive and will continue being conducive to the convergence of inflation to the 3% target in the forecast horizon.",

        "Irene Espinosa voted in favor of maintaining the target at 11.25%.",
        "The level of monetary restriction attained so far has allowed the disinflation process to progress, mainly through the exchange rate and expectations channels, given that domestic demand and credit do not show signs of weakness.",
        "Moreover, the labor market remains tight and the point estimate for the output gap continues in positive territory, which confirms the Mexican economy’s resilience.",
        "Headline inflation is still far from target, the balance of risks for our inflation forecasts remains biased to the upside, and economic activity continues exhibiting dynamism despite the historical increase in the real interest rate.",
        "This is evidence that monetary policy has had to face additional challenges, such as pressures from wage increases and an expansionary fiscal policy, to steer inflation towards the 3% target.",
        "Furthermore, the fact that markets anticipate that inflation will be higher than our forecasts indicates that is premature to begin reducing monetary restriction.",

        "He/she stated that therefore, the progress in disinflation observed during that period becomes less relevant.",
        "Most members underlined that the recent increases in headline inflation have been driven by an increase in the non-core component.",
        "One member indicated that, without minimizing the increase in headline inflation, which the inflation target is based on, it is important to acknowledge that its upward adjustment is due to the non-core component.",
        "He/she argued that the latter is subject to shocks that can cause abrupt and sudden adjustments in several of its items, both to the upside and to the downside, and therefore its behavior does not indicate the direction in which headline inflation could shift in the medium term.",
        "Another member recalled that the non-core component is usually affected by supply-related shocks, the effect of which tends to dissipate relatively quickly.",

        "They considered that its downward trajectory reflects the progress in disinflation.",
        "One member argued that by analyzing this component it is possible to assess the process by which the shocks stemming from the pandemic and the military conflict on inflation fade away.",
        "Another member underlined that the contribution of core inflation to disinflation has been evident, as it accounts for 276 of the 405 basis points of the decline that headline inflation has registered since its peak of this inflationary episode.",
        "One member highlighted that it has reached levels even lower than those observed in June 2021, when the tightening cycle began.",
        "Another member added that in the last four fortnights its variations have been smaller than one standard deviation from its average behavior between 2005 and 2019.",
        "However, some members noted that the pace of decline of core inflation has slowed down.",
        "One member pointed out that the atypical origin of shocks resulted in a very different dynamic of its components from that observed in other episodes.",
        "As part of the analysis of core inflation’s components, the majority underlined the decline in merchandise inflation.",
        "One member highlighted that it has declined for seventeen consecutive months.",
        "He/she considered that both the central bank's monetary policy stance and the mitigation of shocks have contributed to this reduction.",

        "Another member stated that food merchandise inflation, however, remains at high levels.",

        "Some members mentioned that it has remained above 5% despite the monetary tightening.",
        "Some members argued that the atypical shocks of the pandemic and the military conflict continue affecting inflation, especially services prices.",
        "One member stated that after the pandemic, the increased mobility of the population and the recovery of demand for services have allowed costs to be passed on to prices, which has taken longer than anticipated to materialize.",
        "In this regard, another member noted that the shocks have broadly affected both services and merchandise, although with a greater lag on services.",
        "He/she mentioned that as consumption patterns have normalized, the persistence of services, which are typically the most persistent component within core inflation, has been increasing towards its usual levels, after having declined due to the weak demand faced by services, particularly housing services.",
        "He/she added that the subindex of other services shows a persistence greater than historically observed, and that unlike other subindices that have registered a clear reversal, it still does not show a clear reversal to its typical levels.",
        "He/she commented that since a normalization of merchandise persistence has been observed, he/she expects that the persistence corresponding to the other services subindex will also moderate, given the relationship between these two components strengthened.",
        "One member asserted that the prices of housing services, which constitute the item with the highest weight in the CPI, have shown unusually high seasonally adjusted and annualized variations, and the presence of new shocks has more than offset the favorable base effects, resulting in cumulative inflation remaining above its pre-pandemic average.",
        "He/she expressed that the prices of other services such as car insurance, personal care or food-related ones show pressures that could be attributed to a cost passthrough.",
        "Another member stated that demand- related pressures, the current wage policy, and the continued decline in labor productivity have contributed to the resistance of services inflation to decline.",
        "Regarding the increase in non-core inflation, most members noted that it reached 5.54% in April.",
        "Some members indicated that this reading is close to its historical average.",
        "One member pointed out that this component has increased since last year after having registered historically low figures.",
        "Another member noted that the observed variations of the prices within the non-core component have reached more than three standard deviations from their average behavior between 2005 and 2019. on agricultural and livestock product prices and on energy prices.",
        "Some members noted that fruit and vegetable prices have been affected by climaterelated factors.",

        "Regarding short-term expectations, another member considered their evolution as relatively stable.",
        "Some members stated that those corresponding to the end of 2024 and highlighted that they are above the central bank's forecasts.",
        "Regarding expectations drawn from market instruments, another member pointed out that short-term breakeven inflation remained below the upper limit of the variability interval, while for longer terms it remained around 450 basis points above its historical average.",
        "He/she argued that the above suggests a certain resistance to decrease in both implied inflation expectations and the inflation risk premium.",
        "One member noted that expectations drawn from market instruments corresponding to the All members highlighted that, considering that inflationary shocks are foreseen to take longer to dissipate, the forecasts for headline and core inflation have been revised upwards.",
        "Most members stated that services inflation is foreseen to show more persistence, as compared to what had been previously anticipated.",
        "One member mentioned that it is expected to exhibit a downward trend as of the fourth quarter of 2024.",
        "Some members indicated that the revision of forecasts reflects the materialization of certain risks.",
        "One member acknowledged that the prevision of the atypical shocks of the pandemic and the military conflict on services prices has been complex.",
        "He/she noted that there is no quantitative information available on similar past episodes that could have been used as a reference in this period to assess the magnitude and duration of such impacts.",
        "Another member added that the difficulty in predicting the speed at which the persistence of services will return to its historical norm is what has made forecasting its evolution more challenging.",
        "He/she considered that, for this reason, the latest adjustments to the inflation forecast are mainly due to upward revisions in the forecasts for this component.",
        "Some members pointed out that the adjustment in headline inflation forecasts also reflects an increase in price variations of energy, as well as of agricultural and livestock products.",
        "All members mentioned that headline inflation is now expected to converge to the target in the fourth quarter of 2025.",
        "Some members stated that this means that the disinflation process will continue, but at a more gradual pace.",
        "One member highlighted that reductions in core inflation are still foreseen.",
        "Most members considered that the balance of risks for the foreseen inflation trajectory in the forecast horizon remains biased to the upside.",
        "However, one member estimated that, in view of forecast revisions, the balance of risks takes on a less negative tone.",
        "He/she added that certain factors of the external environment of this balance have not shown relevant changes compared to what was observed in previous monetary policy decisions.",
        "He/she indicated that domestically, the expectation of an economic growth lower than previously anticipated has gained relevance, which has implications for slack conditions.",
        "He/she added that, due to the significant reduction of inflation from its peaks during this episode, a risk that has clearly been mitigated is that inflation could have settled at the referred high levels.",
        "Another member warned that the balance of risks has deteriorated due to domestic-related pressures associated with the dynamism of the economy, a tight labor market, significant wage increases, and uncertainty regarding the effects of the expansionary fiscal policy.",
        "He/she considered that the inflationary environment is much more complex than that faced at the beginning of last year.",
        "Among upward risks, the majority mentioned the persistence of core inflation, specifically its services component.",
        "One member highlighted the risk of economic activity showing greater-thanexpected resilience.",
        "Some members expressed uncertainty as to the potential effect of fiscal policy.",
        "Some members added the possibility of greater cost- related pressures of various nature.",
        "In particular, one member pointed out the potential effects of the tightening of the labor market and wage increases.",
        "Another member underlined the risk of an exchange rate depreciation.",
        "Some members added as upward risks for inflation the possibility that non-core inflation tends to settle at its long-term average.",

        "He/she noted that the forecasts estimate that non-core inflation returns to that for this reason future forecasts could be adjusted upwards.",
        "Another member indicated that variations in relative prices of certain agricultural and livestock products are more likely to affect consumer inflation expectations and that monetary policy should avoid these second-round effects.",
        "As for risks to the downside, one member pointed out the possibility of an economic slowdown.",
        "Another member underlined the possibility that lower exchange rate levels compared to those observed in the early months of last year may contribute more than anticipated to mitigate certain pressures on inflation.",
        "The majority mentioned that domestic financial markets experienced bouts of volatility, as was the case for international ones.",
        "The majority exhibited volatility and that the Mexican peso registered a depreciation.",
        "Some members noted a temporary deterioration in trading conditions.",
        "One member added that these conditions have been gradually improving.",
        "Some members pointed out that part of the volatility resulted from the liquidation of long positions.",
        "One member added that it was also due to the unwinding of carry trade strategies and other technical factors.",
        "Some members highlighted the high sensitivity of the Mexican peso to the global environment of risk aversion.",
        "One member pointed out that this caused the Mexican peso to be among the currencies with the highest depreciation in some trading sessions.",
        "Some members noted that prospective information anticipates possible exchange rate depreciations in the coming months.",
        "One member highlighted that, despite all of the above, the Mexican peso has remained below the levels observed in 2023.",
        "He/she recalled that in the first months of the year, the Mexican peso appreciated visibly, reaching in late March and early April levels unseen since 2015.",
        "Some members expressed that the Mexican peso continues standing out among emerging economies’ currencies that have exhibited greater resilience.",
        "One member stated that this has contributed to the restriction of monetary conditions.",
        "Another member expressed that the resilience of the Mexican peso has been aided by the monetary policy actions implemented by the central bank, which have contributed to maintaining a volatility-adjusted interest rate spread between Mexico and the United States that remains attractive.",
        "He/she added that other factors have also influenced the evolution of the exchange rate, such as the favorable outlook associated with the nearshoring phenomenon and the country's sound macroeconomic fundamentals.",
        "One member mentioned that the liquidation of long positions on the Mexican peso, sound macroeconomic fundamentals and the high volatilityadjusted interest rate spread can contribute to reduce the possibility of a sudden adjustment in the exchange rate.",
        "The majority noted that, since the last monetary policy meeting, government bond yields have increased along the entire yield curve.",
        "One member mentioned that this was due to the high correlation with US markets and to a greater risk aversion.",
        "Another member stated that interest rates exhibited greater volatility after the March meeting.",
        "He/she added that in May, however, these registered a certain downward adjustment, in line with international markets.",
        "One member pointed out that the dynamics of short-term interest rates have also responded to revisions in expectations regarding Mexico’s monetary policy.",
        "He/she specified that neither markets nor analysts anticipate a change in the reference rate in May, while the former expects it to reach 10.2 and the latter 10.0%, by the end of the year.",
        "Another member argued that short-term interest rates in domestic markets have also been subject to pressures stemming from the increasing cost that Pemex has faced to issue debt.",
        "Regarding capital flows, one member pointed out that there were outflows of foreign investors in M-bonos, which were partially offset by inflows in Udibonos.",

        "Based on the above, with the presence of all its members, the Board decided unanimously to leave the target for the overnight interbank interest rate unchanged at 11.00%.",
        "With this decision, the monetary policy stance remains restrictive and will continue being conducive to the convergence of inflation The Board will thoroughly monitor inflationary pressures as well as all factors that have an incidence on the foreseen path for inflation and its expectations.",

        "Actions will be implemented in such a way that the reference rate remains consistent at all times with the trajectory needed to enable an orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to the 3% target during the forecast period.",
        "The central bank reaffirms its commitment with its primary mandate and the need to continue its efforts to consolidate an environment of low and One member pointed out that during this inflationary episode, there have been different stages, each of them entailing alternative implications for monetary policy conduction.",
        "He/she highlighted how, given its commitment to its primary mandate, Banco de México raised the reference rate by 725 basis points to a level of 11.25%.",
        "He/she recalled that when the reference rate was last increased in March 2023, headline inflation was at 6.85% and core inflation was at 8.09%.",
        "He/she commented that at that time it was evident that before considering reference rate cuts, it was necessary to observe a significant advance of the ongoing disinflation process.",
        "He/she argued that, in contrast, in 2024 both headline and core inflation have remained at levels noticeably lower than their peak levels during this inflationary episode, and the disinflationary process has advanced.",
        "He/she considered that the current environment, while still challenging, is less adverse than in 2022 and early 2023.",
        "He/she deemed that, consequently, we are now entering a new stage where it is possible to assess the possibility of reference rate cuts on a meeting-by-meeting basis, depending on the evolution of the inflation outlook.",
        "He/she explained that for this reason the last monetary policy meeting the reference rate was reduced by 25 basis points, given the progress in disinflation.",
        "However, he/she considered that subsequent reductions should be gradual given the higher-than-anticipated persistence in services inflation, and that the effects of inflationary shocks are now expected to dissipate more gradually than previously anticipated.",
        "He/she stated that, given this outlook it is appropriate to make a pause at this monetary policy meeting.",
        "He/she indicated that the inflationary environment is such that it allows to consider potential reference rate cuts going forward, with decisions contingent on the inflation outlook.",
        "He/she stated that a continued assessment of all inflation determinants will be necessary.",
        "He/she underlined that it is essential to continue weighing the undeniable progress achieved in Mexico’s disinflationary process against the challenges that still prevail.",
        "He/she highlighted that it will be important to consider that the restrictive policy stance that has been maintained and the one prevailing in the future will impact the evolution of inflation within the planning horizon.",
        "He/she emphasized that monetary policy decisions will continue to be such that the monetary policy stance leads annual headline inflation to converge to the 3% target in the forecast period.",
        "Another member expressed that it is valid to acknowledge the progress made in the disinflationary process, attributable to a sound, timely, and effective monetary policy.",
        "However, he/she pointed out that looking into the past does not guarantee the convergence of inflation within the planning horizon.",
        "He/she argued that the inflation forecast targeting regime requires looking into the future and ensure that monetary conditions remain at the levels required to achieve such convergence.",
        "He/she warned that, in view of the risks faced and the slowdown in the disinflationary process, the achieved monetary restriction should be firmly maintained.",
        "In particular, he/she reiterated his/her concern about the potential effects on the inflation trajectory of a divergence of public finances from what is expected or being affected by the situation of Pemex.",
        "He/she also reiterated the challenges that will be faced in monetary policies, given that the expectation of a decline in inflation is subject to the Public Sector Borrowing Requirements (PSBR) being reduced by not materialize, would exert greater-than-expected pressures on aggregate demand and debt markets.",
        "He/she also indicated that the inflation forecast was revised upwards, as he/she had warned could occur during the previous meeting.",
        "He/she argued that the reduction in the reference rate in the March decision, which he/she considered premature, incurred a social cost, as it required extending the monetary restriction for a longer period.",
        "looking ahead, commitment to the primary goal must be strengthened and that a forward-looking and datadependent approach should be prioritized, avoiding any premature adjustments.",
        "In this regard, he/she deemed that communication with the markets should prioritize institutional messages and avoid generating volatility.",
        "Finally, he/she argued that it is important for the central bank to intensify its efforts in reviewing exhaustively its forecasting tools that allow the inclusion of the changes observed in recent years in both global and Mexican economies and that might have generated structural changes, in addition to other factors, such as climate change, which have become increasingly relevant in understanding price formation and that have implied less precision.",
        "This will contribute to a more efficient attainment of the price stability objective for the benefit of the population, especially its lowest-income segment.",
        "disinflationary process is complex and not devoid of difficulties.",
        "He/she underlined that despite the progress in core inflation, non-core inflation has reversed considerably, while the central bank’s forecasts now consider a greater persistence of the services component.",
        "He/she mentioned that the main upward risk to inflation indicated in the balance for inflation has materialized and, consequently, timely convergence to the target has been delayed by two quarters.",
        "He/she added that, although most recent data indicate that the economic cycle has lost momentum, demand is expected to recover significantly during the second quarter of the year.",
        "He/she considered that synchronization between a higher expected persistence in inflation and the temporary dynamism of economic activity suggests that it is prudent to make a pause to the adjustments in the reference rate, in order to have more information on inflation determinants and on the performance of the monetary policy transmission channels.",
        "He/she commented that, although the exante real interest rate decreased in the last monetary policy decision, the real exchange rate continued appreciating, reaching levels unseen since 2008, while interest rates implied by market instruments increased considerably.",
        "In this regard, he/she stated that monetary conditions remain notably restrictive.",
        "He/she highlighted that the difference between the ex-ante real interest rate and the central estimate of the neutral rate is approximately three times the difference between observed inflation and its target.",
        "He/she pointed out that this proportion is unprecedented in Mexico and has facilitated the effective operation of all the monetary policy transmission channels throughout the cycle.",
        "However, he/she warned that the effects of such transmission are not symmetrical across inflation components, resulting in differentiated lags in price adjustments between goods and services.",
        "He/she explained that this suggests that the pace and scale of possible adjustments in the monetary policy stance should continue to be gradual to ensure the transmission to less sensitive components without causing disorderly deviations in those that are more reactive to different transmission channels.",
        "Looking ahead, he/she judged that if the evolution of macroeconomic conditions is consistent with updated inflation forecasts, it may be appropriate to reassess any space for recalibrating the level of monetary restriction once again.",
        "He/she argued that the data-dependent approach relying on forecasts and on a decision-by-decision basis, is the best way to ensure a prudent implementation of monetary policy based on the complexity of the disinflationary process, and fully complying with the constitutional mandate and seeking to achieve an orderly adjustment of the economy and financial markets.",
        "Another member expressed that, given the stagnation of inflation, a deteriorated balance of risks and the expectation of inflation above target for a longer period, no additional fine-tuning of the target rate can be made, either now or in the following months, and a restrictive stance should be maintained for an extended period.",
        "He/she considered that the moderate reductions in core inflation and the risks that non-core inflation reaches its historical average, demand a restrictive stance that avoids indirect effects of the non-core component on core inflation.",
        "He/she argued that a monetary easing cycle appears distant, and thus the fine-tuning of the previous decision needs to be interpreted correctly, considering that changes to the nominal rate seek to maintain the monetary policy stance relatively constant in a range of restriction for the ex-ante real rate between 7 and 7.5%.",
        "He/she mentioned that the weakness and low efficiency of most transmission channels in Mexico supports the case for maintaining the level of restriction for a longer period, and therefore adjustments to the reference rate should be more spaced out and more gradual than as anticipated by analysts.",
        "He/she pointed out that the vigorous growth of bank lending reflects the weakness of the credit channel, and that the high liquidity of the Mexican peso results in exchange rate fluctuations that are beyond monetary policy and limit the extent of the exchange rate transmission channel.",
        "He/she argued that the expectations channel is the one that operates with greater effectiveness.",
        "He/she judged that analyzing the output gap, delinquency rates, or the economic slowdown becomes relevant only to the extent that they contribute to understanding how monetary policy can anchor inflation expectations.",
        "He/she stated that inflation expectations above 3% should not be tolerated for any term, and therefore intermediate targets focused on returning these expectations to their historical averages should be discarded.",
        "Instead, advantage should be taken of the high monetary restriction to continuously, forcefully and unrestrictedly converge to 3%.",
        "He/she indicated that in subsequent decisions, the signals sent and their effects on inflation expectations should be carefully assessed.",
        "In this regard, he/she added that the direction of adjustments of the target rate is an even stronger signal than the level of the reference rate per se.",
        "For example, he/she underlined that, on this occasion, lowering the rate from 11 to 10.75% would send a premature signal of complacency with the observed trajectory of inflation.",
        "On the contrary he/she noted that maintaining the target rate unchanged signals that the central bank is not satisfied with inflation levels, that inflationary risks are acknowledged, and that there is a commitment to the 3% target.",
        "For this reason, he/she added that the central bank communication must assure that the bank is determined to attain the target at all costs.",
        "He/she suggested that for the upcoming decisions, not only should the current level of monetary restriction be maintained as long as core inflation, especially its services component, does not show a clear downward trend, but this intention should be explicitly stated in the forward guidance.",
        "He/she commented that in the second half of the year there would be greater clarity to make fine adjustments, even more gradual than anticipated, and only if conditions warrant it.",
        "He/she affirmed that monetary policy decisions should remain independent of the decisions made by the Federal Reserve and that it is not possible to compare Mexico’s interest rate spreads with those of other countries since the target rates respond to contexts and needs that are not entirely comparable.",
        "He/she cautioned that if inflation and its expectations remain persistently outside the variability range, the possibility of assessing the degree of monetary restriction required to achieve the 3% target should be considered.",
        "One member considered that, in light of the revision of the inflation forecast resulting from a greater persistence of the services component, it is appropriate to leave the reference rate unchanged on this occasion.",
        "He/she stated that this allows to reinforce a stance conducive to preventing inflation expectations from becoming contaminated.",
        "In this context, he/she deemed it relevant for the conduction of monetary policy to assess the dynamics within services inflation.",
        "He/she mentioned that the subindex of other services shows greater persistence compared to its historical norm.",
        "He/she added that, as its relationship with the merchandise component strengthened, it continues to reflect in a lagged manner the multiple shocks that gave rise to the atypical inflationary episode.",
        "He/she highlighted that other components of services inflation, such as housing, and which initially exhibited less persistence, have been reverting to their typical behavior.",
        "He/she added that monetary policy is transmitted heterogeneously to different components of inflation, with a more lagged effect on services, as this sector is less capital-intensive and more laborintensive.",
        "He/she pointed out that these elements should be taken into account in monetary policy implementation since they do not indicate new pressures, but rather that disturbances observed over the previous years continue to dissipate, albeit at a slower pace.",
        "He/she argued that the described phenomenon requires maintaining an adequate monetary restriction given a less adverse risk outlook than that faced in 2023, and thus it does not require keeping the monetary policy stance at historically restrictive levels.",
        "He/she stated that a gradual approach will allow adjusting the monetary restriction, ensuring it continues to be transmitted to other sectors where its impact has been less pronounced.",
        "He/she commented that the monetary policy stance should consider the trends in the inflation outlook overall and avoid adopting an overly data-dependent approach or focusing on a single variable.",
        "He/she stated that progress in the inflationary outlook is undeniable given the significant reductions in inflation, the gradual mitigation of the risk of inflation settling at high levels, and that, looking ahead, there is the expectation that it will continue decreasing, albeit at a slower pace.",
        "Considering all of the above, he/she sustained that an adjustment to the policy rate at the next meeting could be considered if the intermediate inflation targets, such as the inflation forecast, are met.",
        "He/she expressed that the current policy stance is highly restrictive and that, even with additional adjustments, it will remain robust despite changes in the relative stance compared to other economies.",
        "He/she emphasized that continuing with rate adjustments does not imply abandoning a restrictive stance.",
        "He/she warned that such stance will remain necessary throughout the forecast horizon, given the challenges that still prevail.",
        "The Governing Board evaluated the easing of the effects of the shocks on inflation and its determinants, the behavior of medium- and long-term inflation expectations, and the disinflationary process.",
        "It stated that challenges and risks prevail, which requires monetary policy to continue being managed prudently.",
        "It took into account the expectation that the effects of the shocks will affect inflation longer than had been anticipated.",

        "Victoria Rodríguez, Galia Borja, Irene Espinosa, Jonathan Heath, and Omar Mejía voted in favor of leaving the overnight interbank interest rate unchanged at 11.00%.",
        "Some members expect world economic activity to have continued increasing during the second quarter of 2024, although at a slower pace than in the previous quarter.",
        "One member argued that the sound global economic performance expected for this year would be driven by a stronger growth in advanced economies, while a more generalized weakening is expected in emerging economies.",
        "Among global growth risks, he/she mentioned that several of them persist, including those stemming from the expectation of higher interest rates for a longer period, the high levels of fiscal deficits in a large number of economies, the political uncertainty associated with various electoral processes, particularly in the United States, and geopolitical tensions.",
        "Regarding the US economy, he/she underlined the soundness of domestic demand as a result of the boost provided by private consumption.",
        "He/she considered that the US labor market continues showing resilience.",
        "Another member noted some of the factors behind this resilience, the fading of which could affect economic activity in the future.",
        "He/she argued that fiscal support together with unconventional monetary stimulus measures to mitigate the effects of the pandemic contributed, on the one hand, to generate excess savings and an improvement in households' financial position, mainly in the United States, which supported private consumption.",
        "On the other hand, he/she noted that limited refinancing needs were observed in the corporate sector, which took place under relatively favorable credit conditions.",
        "However, he/she added that currently the outlook is different, given the less sound financial situation of firms and households.",
        "Regarding households, he/she stated that in the United States, for example, excess savings and leverage are already at their pre-pandemic trend levels, while real disposable income has moderated its growth.",
        "Thus, he/she indicated that, although consumption of services in that economy continues showing dynamism, consumption of goods has somewhat declined, which reflects consumers that are more aware of the signs of moderation in the labor market.",
        "As for firms, he/she pointed out that greater refinancing needs are expected, which, according to forecasts, will be at higher rates.",
        "Finally, he/she stated that, in his/her opinion, in light of the fading of these factors that once supported economic resilience, a more efficient pass-through of restrictive monetary policy stances is expected.",
        "Some members expect a moderation of the US economy in the next quarters.",
        "One member expressed that this could be more evident in that country's industrial activity.",
        "Most members highlighted that the disinflation members pointed out that headline inflation has continued decreasing in most advanced economies.",
        "The majority indicated that this was due to lower pressures on food prices.",
        "Some members added that it was also due to a reduction in goods inflation.",
        "Nevertheless, some members considered that the recent progress in disinflation has been moderate.",
        "Most members highlighted that there is some heterogeneity in the behavior of inflation across economies.",
        "Some members indicated that US inflation decreased between April and May.",
        "One member noted that in the euro area, annual headline inflation rose during the same period due to an increase in the core component and a rebound in energy inflation.",
        "Another member stated that some emerging economies registered increases in headline inflation due to higher pressures on energy prices and, in some cases, due to a rise in food prices.",
        "One member added that services inflation resistance to decline is a global phenomenon with low correlation to the cyclical phase of different economies.",
        "Most members agreed that the disinflation process is expected to continue.",
        "However, some members pointed out that inflation is still anticipated to remain above central banks' targets.",
        "One member indicated that there is a prevailing expectation that in some economies convergence to the inflation target will be postponed again until early 2025.",
        "The majority noted that some central banks of advanced economies left their reference rates unchanged, while others lowered them.",
        "Some members stated that most of them maintained a cautious tone.",
        "One member pointed out that these institutions emphasized a greater data dependence in their future decisions.",
        "Another member indicated that, despite the heterogeneity in the monetary cycles of different economies, the discussion in most central banks has focused on avoiding the adoption of an overly restrictive monetary policy stance.",
        "All members mentioned that the Federal Reserve left the federal funds rate unchanged for the seventh consecutive occasion.",
        "Some members noted that its policy statement acknowledged modest progress towards the inflation target in recent months.",
        "One member pointed out that the statement reiterated that risks to achieving its employment and price stability goals have moved towards better balance.",

        "Most members underlined that the chairman of said institution stated that there is still uncertainty as to whether inflation is steadily moving to the 2% target.",
        "One member added that said chairman stated that evidence clearly shows that the monetary policy stance is restrictive and is having the expected effects.",
        "Most members expressed that the European Central Bank lowered its interest rates at its June meeting after having left them unchanged for nine months.",
        "Some members specified that this rate cut was accompanied by an upward revision of their inflation forecasts.",

        "Another member indicated that various monetary authorities in Latin America and Eastern Europe continued lowering their reference rates.",
        "All members noted that the Federal Reserve's economic projections included a lower number of rate cuts anticipated for this year.",
        "Most members added that slightly higher rates are also projections.",
        "Some members expressed that the median of projections for the long-term interest rate increased.",
        "One member pointed out that this change was from 2.6 to 2.8%.",
        "He/she considered that the greater dispersion among members' projections for the long-term interest rate reflects greater uncertainty as to where the US economy might converge.",
        "In this regard, he/she ruled out implications for monetary policy in the short term.",
        "Regarding emerging economies, another member pointed out that in most of them the expectation that reference rates will remain high for a longer period has strengthened.",
        "Most members noted that international financial markets exhibited some volatility, although end- to-end variations were mixed and moderate.",
        "Some members added that the release of higherthan-anticipated US inflation and employment figures led to an adjustment in expectations about the path of the federal funds rate.",
        "One member mentioned that in light of better-than-expected figures US government bond yields declined slightly.",
        "Another member highlighted that the evolution of geopolitical tensions also contributed to said volatility.",

        "Some members noted that stock market indices registered gains.",
        "One member pointed out that developed countries registered increases, while emerging ones registered losses.",
        "Another member argued that the materialization of adverse events related to electoral processes, geopolitical conflicts, and global economic growth could intensify international financial volatility, with negative effects particularly for emerging economies.",
        "The majority pointed out that, at the beginning of the second quarter of 2024, Mexico’s economic activity continued exhibiting the weakness observed since the end of 2023.",
        "Some members pointed out that the IGAE registered a contraction in April.",
        "One member stated that this result was caused by decreases in the three main sectors of economic activity.",

        "Most members asserted that recent dynamism.",
        "One member warned that this, together with the timely indicator for May, suggests that the economic slowdown has extended, contrary to what had been anticipated.",
        "Another member added that this slowdown contrasts with the previous expectation that economic activity would be at high levels in the first half of the year.",
        "Nevertheless, one member expressed that INEGI estimates an expansion in May that could offset the fall in April.",
        "He/she added that various indicators of production, demand and employment show mixed signals, which, together with greater uncertainty associated with the country’s political transition, make it difficult to anticipate the economy's performance for this year and the next one.",
        "Regarding the performance of the productive sectors, the majority noted that IGAE data of decreased at a monthly rate due to a greater sluggishness in manufacturing.",
        "Most members argued that construction has expanded at lower monthly rates than those registered in previous months.",

        "Another member stated that the tertiary sector as a whole seems to be affected by the weakness of secondary activities, especially those more related to industrial use, such as commercial activities.",
        "Meanwhile, he/she noted that timely estimates suggest that the weakness in the primary sector could extend throughout the quarter.",
        "One member pointed out that, nevertheless, considering the annual variation of economic activity data for the first quarter, a 1.9% growth rate is observed.",

        "Most members noted that the forecasts for headline and core inflation were revised slightly in some quarters.",

        "Another member highlighted that the impact of the depreciation on merchandise prices would be reflected with a certain lag and the degree of the pass-through will depend on the timing of the exchange rate adjustment and the behavior of other inflationary determinants.",
        "The depreciation of the Mexican peso impacts inflation forecasts upwards, its effects are partly offset by those associated with the greater weakness exhibited by economic activity.",
        "One member considered that the lower economic activity would allow the decline in headline inflation to resume shortly.",

        "One member stated that the upward bias became more pronounced and that a more uncertain inflationary outlook is now currently faced.",
        "He/she indicated that since the balance of risks is determined with a forward-looking approach, less weight should be given to the already observed decline in inflation from its peak, and more weight should be granted to the fact that progress in disinflation has paused since October 2023 and is at risk of reverting.",
        "Another member expressed that the shock associated with the slowdown in economic activity will last longer than the volatility shock associated with idiosyncratic factors, and thus the former will play a more relevant role in inflation dynamics.",
        "The majority held that there is the risk of a greater pressure on inflation.",
        "One member pointed out that the intensity and duration of adjustments in financial markets are uncertain and could hinder the convergence of inflation to the target within the planning horizon.",

        "However, another member deemed it possible that part of the exchange rate shock may be temporary or may moderate to some extent, which could imply a lower exchange rate pass-through.",
        "The majority added that the expected economic slowdown could mitigate the risk of the exchange rate pass-through.",
        "One member highlighted that studies on the Mexican economy show that the coefficient of the exchange rate pass-through to inflation is lower under greater slack conditions.",
        "He/she argued that the anchoring of inflation expectations has significantly reduced the pass-through over the last two decades.",
        "Another member pointed out that, although the pass-through of the depreciation to costs has been low in recent years, the nature and magnitude of the exchange rate shock, its duration and slack conditions, among other factors, will be decisive in its inflationary effects.",
        "Meanwhile, one member argued that a recent study shows that in both advanced and emerging economies the magnitude of the exchange rate pass-through depends on the nature of the shock that contributed to the currency depreciation.",
        "He/she pointed out that, according to said study, in the case of Mexico, the pass-through is greater when the nature of the shock is idiosyncratic, with demandrelated shocks and risk premium shocks having the largest effects.",
        "Most members highlighted as an upward risk the persistence of core inflation, especially of its services component.",
        "One member considered that the persistence of services inflation could continue due to the lag in the relative price readjustment and because cost increases have not yet fully passed on to consumer prices.",
        "He/she warned that merchandise inflation could decline less, potentially halting the deceleration of the core component.",
        "He/she added that the decline in food merchandise inflation could reverse direction once the favorable shocks to this component dissipate and the comparison base effect becomes more relevant.",
        "He/she deemed that non-food merchandise inflation is reaching low levels that are difficult to sustain.",
        "He/she warned about the risk that non-food merchandise inflation, as it converges to its mean, may no longer offset the persistence of services inflation, initiating an upward trend in core inflation.",

        "One member emphasized the risks associated with an intensification of the geopolitical conflicts.",
        "Some members stated that some of the mentioned risks could be offset by a lower-than-anticipated economic activity.",
        "One member estimated that greater slack, in addition to offsetting the potential effects of currency depreciation, will contribute to a decline in services inflation.",
        "He/she stated that the easing of slack conditions has increased and is likely to last longer than the volatility shock.",
        "Some members noted that during the weeks following the last monetary policy meeting, domestic financial markets exhibited a stable behavior.",

        "One member specified that after having been below 17 pesos per dollar in May, in June the exchange rate reached levels similar to those observed in the early months of 2023, although still below those registered in 2022.",
        "Another member highlighted that the Mexican peso briefly reached a level of 19 pesos per dollar, making it the emerging economy currency with the highest depreciation on certain trading days.",
        "Some members added that the currency exhibited a broad trading range.",
        "One member indicated that, in his/her opinion, the Mexican peso returned to levels close to its fundamentals, thus correcting the overvaluation observed in the past year.",
        "Some members argued that this behavior of the Mexican peso was due to a lower appetite for local assets and the liquidation of long Mexican peso positions, mainly in short-term foreign exchange derivatives.",
        "One member specified that this was partly due to the unwinding of carry trade positions following the decline in the volatilityadjusted interest rate spread.",
        "He/she emphasized that volatility and the skew implied in the options market increased significantly, reaching year-high levels.",
        "He/she underlined that, consistent with the above, there has been an increase in the demand for hedging in view of possible subsequent depreciation episodes.",
        "Another member pointed out that, in the medium term, expectations continue signaling a bias towards depreciation.",
        "One member considered that, in light of the deterioration in trading conditions, the proper functioning of the foreign exchange market should be monitored, and underlined that this does not imply that there is a specific target level.",
        "The majority pointed out that part of the exchange rate adjustment has reversed in recent days.",

        "One member added that broad trading ranges were observed.",
        "Another member pointed out that a certain reversal in said rates has been observed in recent days.",
        "One member mentioned that a more restrictive stance of the US Federal Reserve and expectations of less reference rate cuts for the remainder of the year, along with idiosyncratic factors, have contributed to the increase in the interest rate spread of Mexican bonds.",
        "He/she added that, despite the above, this spread appears less attractive after adjusting for the volatility of the Mexican peso, although it remains at levels higher than most comparable emerging currencies.",
        "Another member stated that in recent weeks there was a capital outflow mainly of M-Bonos held by nonresidents.",
        "He/she mentioned that the interest rate derivatives market exhibited a similar behavior to that of government bonds, with significant increases and high volatility.",
        "He/she argued that part of the movements is explained by closing positions, as well as by demand for currency hedging in view of changes in interest rates.",
        "He/she indicated that the implied expectations for the trajectory of the reference rate in TIIE swaps discount with a higher probability that the next reference rate cut will occur only until the November policy decision, and that the reference rate will close the year at 10.60%.",
        "He/she emphasized that this contrasts with the median of expectations of private sector analysts, who anticipate the next reference rate adjustment in August and a year-end rate of 10.25%.",
        "He/she added that, in both cases, there has been a correction in monetary policy expectations.",

        "He/she warned that, in the medium term, expectations of a higher risk premium prevail.",
        "However, another member commented that increases in risk premia have been limited compared to other stress episodes.",
        "Most members pointed out that the stock market performed unfavorably due to the lower risk One member considered that, looking ahead, incoming information can help mitigate uncertainty and contribute to the further stabilization of domestic financial markets.",
        "He/she stated that a number of factors can contribute to the above, such as the sound macroeconomic fundamentals, particularly compared to other emerging economies.",
        "He/she highlighted fiscal discipline, sustainable external accounts, a well-capitalized Mexican banking system with no currency imbalances, a developed financial derivatives market that allows economic agents to hedge the exchange rate risk, and adequate levels of international reserves.",
        "He/she noted that two primary pillars of the country's macroeconomic policy framework are an autonomous central bank with a price stability mandate and a flexible exchange rate regime.",
        "Some members underlined that, under this regime, the exchange rate acts as a shock absorber, helping the economy to adjust in an orderly manner.",
        "Most members highlighted that total financing in the economy continued increasing.",
        "One member attributed said growth to the domestic component.",
        "He/she added that domestic financing to the private sector exhibited solid growth in April, although it continued decelerating.",
        "Some members indicated that commercial bank credit maintained its dynamism.",

        "With the presence of all its members, the Board decided by majority to maintain the target for the overnight interbank interest rate at 11.00%.",
        "With this decision, the monetary policy stance remains restrictive and will continue being conducive to the convergence of inflation Looking ahead, the Board foresees that the discussing reference rate adjustments.",
        "It will take into account the prospects that global shocks will continue dissipating and the effects of a weaker-than-anticipated economic activity.",
        "It will consider the incidence of both the restrictive policy stance that has been maintained and that prevailing in the future on inflation throughout the horizon in which monetary policy operates.",
        "Actions will be implemented in such a way that the reference rate remains consistent at all times with the trajectory needed to enable an orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to the 3% target during the forecast period.",
        "The central bank reaffirms its commitment with its primary mandate and the need to continue its efforts to consolidate an environment of low and One member stated that this is one of the most complex decisions of the monetary cycle as the economy experiences two shocks acting in opposite directions on inflation.",
        "He/she pointed out that, on the one hand, there is a period of volatility associated with idiosyncratic factors, while, on the other hand, the risk of a greater-than-expected easing of slack conditions has gained relevance, the latter factor lasting longer.",
        "He/she expressed that an adjustment in the monetary restriction is consistent with risks to the outlook, given the highly restrictive policy stance and the progress in disinflation.",
        "Among these risks, he/she highlighted the risk of a higher depreciation.",
        "He/she stated that, while volatility should be monitored, the conduction of monetary policy should address it to the extent that it affects inflation.",
        "He/she added that, given the expectation of greater slack conditions, the pass-through to prices could be lower, as suggested by the evidence of Mexico, and would also contribute to reduce services inflation.",
        "Therefore, he/she considered that, as a result, the risk associated with the economic slowdown gains more importance due to its implications for inflation dynamics.",
        "He/she expressed that a gradual approach allows to take actions responsibly, addressing all inflation determinants within monetary policy’s horizon.",
        "He/she argued that failing to address changes in the inflation outlook in a timely manner, such as the current intensification of risks to the downside, could imply larger adjustments in the future, making the conduction and communication of monetary policy more challenging.",
        "He/she considered it inappropriate to adopt a highly datadependent stance, as this would be equivalent to incorporating only part of the information and conducting monetary policy with lags, which would imply unnecessary costs.",
        "He/she added that an optimal conduction of monetary policy should de forward-looking, considering both the observed and the expected inflation determinants.",
        "He/she underlined that making additional adjustments to the reference rate does not imply abandoning a restrictive policy stance, which will remain necessary throughout the forecast horizon, given the challenges that prevail.",
        "He/she indicated that the challenge lies in defining the pace of such adjustments, taking into account the behavior of inflation with respect to intermediate targets, the performance of its determinants, the prevailing risks, and assigning weight to the outlook for the inflation environment.",
        "Another member expressed that, since the last monetary policy meeting, the challenges of persistence and of a slowdown in the disinflation process have continued.",
        "He/she added that currently there is also an unforeseen shock of financial volatility generated by idiosyncratic factors, which represents an additional obstacle to achieving the convergence of inflation to the target within the planning horizon.",
        "He/she mentioned the risk that the monetary restriction might be insufficient to achieve such convergence if the reference rate is reduced or if inflation expectations increase.",
        "He/she considered that, therefore, the outlook for the conduction of monetary policy has become more complex.",
        "In this regard, he/she underlined headline inflation’s upward trend, the mixed changes in inflation expectations between April and May, the adjustment in inflation forecasts, and a labor market that remains tight.",
        "He/she expressed that the strength of consumption and, to a lesser extent, of investment, as well as the fiscal policy outlook, would imply a lesser-thananticipated deterioration for economic activity for the remainder of 2024.",
        "He/she considered that all of the above, coupled with a balance of risks for inflation biased to the upside, indicates that monetary policy should continue being conducted cautiously.",
        "He/she estimated that, given the current environment of high uncertainty and financial volatility, a reference rate cut would come as a surprise to most market participants and could increase exchange rate volatility and raise inflation expectations.",
        "For this reason, he/she considered that a risk management approach should be prioritized in an environment of increasing uncertainty, fueled by idiosyncratic and external shocks.",
        "He/she argued that refraining from modifying the target rate will help maintain inflation expectations anchored and strengthen Banco de México's credibility and its commitment to the primary mandate of price stability.",
        "He/she expressed that the central bank’s communication should place emphasis on a cautious and data-dependent approach.",
        "One member mentioned that, since the last monetary policy decision, the international outlook has had few changes, while domestically, two shocks have been observed of different nature, magnitude, and duration that, for the moment, have tended to offset each other.",
        "He/she mentioned that one of them is associated with the increased uncertainty that led to financial volatility during the period, while the other one refers to the Mexican economy decelerating at a faster-than-anticipated pace, in a context in which high dynamism was anticipated for the first half of the year.",
        "He/she pointed out that the financial volatility registered this month has led to an environment of greater uncertainty compared to previous decisions, although in recent days volatility has moderated, in line with Mexico’s solid macroeconomic fundamentals.",
        "In this regard, he/she argued that uncertainty shocks have implications for both the real and financial sectors.",
        "He/she expressed that, in both sectors, economic agents postpone making decisions as they await more precise information and proceed cautiously, being less reactive to changes in the economic environment, including reference rate adjustments.",
        "He/she added that, in environments of lesser certainty, the reference rate may have a lesser effect on long-term bond rates if risk premia adjust in the opposite direction, thereby complicating transmission along the yield curve.",
        "He/she emphasized that, while the monetary policy stance is undoubtedly restrictive, given the uncertainty surrounding certain inflation determinants, it is appropriate on this occasion to extend the pause in order to continue assessing both the disinflation process and the monetary policy transmission mechanism.",
        "He/she expressed that if their behavior is as expected and if macroeconomic conditions, including aggregate demand, contribute to fostering a more favorable price dynamic, it would be appropriate to resume the downward adjustments in order to pursue a more efficient balance in the conduction of monetary policy.",
        "He/she stated that this decision seeks to manage both upward and downward risks to inflation and to foster an orderly adjustment of markets and the overall economy, in compliance with the constitutional mandate.",
        "Another member estimated it is not necessary to lower the reference rate before there is greater certainty that inflation, specifically core inflation, including its services subcomponent, show a downward trend and displays a clear convergence to the 3% target.",
        "Similarly, he/she considered that the target rate should be consistent with the deterioration in market trading conditions and with the expectation of high rates due to greater domestic risk premia.",
        "He/she pointed out that external monetary conditions and the rate differential are beginning to gain relevance in determining the monetary policy stance.",
        "He/she deemed that a high and prolonged restrictive stance is required given its lagged effects on aggregate demand and the low effectiveness of its transmission mechanisms.",
        "He/she noted that bank credit, despite certain moderation, and monetary aggregates in real terms maintain a vigorous dynamic, indicating that the effects of the monetary policy stance have not yet fully materialized.",
        "He/she added that, in view of the observed depreciation, the exchange rate channel may cease to contain certain pressures, despite the low pass-through of the foreign exchange depreciation.",
        "He/she considered that a strategy of occasional and gradual datadependent calibrations to the monetary policy stance is adequate.",
        "He/she noted that further fine-tuning requires a downward trend in services inflation, a substantial improvement in inflationary expectations, and that convergence to the projected inflation target by the end of 2025 materializes.",
        "He/she pointed out that any eventual adjustments would be implemented in order to maintain the ex-ante real interest rate in a March decision, such rate has increased by 12 basis points, thus laying towards the middle of said range.",
        "He/she underlined the importance of monitoring the effects of inflationary and exchange rate pressures on inflation expectations.",

        "In addition, there are specific instruments to ensure the well-functioning of markets, and monetary policy must react accordingly to their impact on our central baseline scenario, which, given the impact of both shocks combined, does not display relevant changes and allows to continue adjusting our monetary policy stance, which should be set to enable the convergence of inflation, ensuring an orderly adjustment of the economy and markets.",

        "He/she added that the analysis carried out does not point to any effects on core inflation, despite the pressures on the non-core component being felt since the end of last year.",

        "Some members commented that additional bouts of volatility cannot be ruled out.",
        "One member considered that, in an uncertain environment, markets have tended to overreact to economic news.",

        "He/she emphasized the notable progress in the reduction of core inflation, which better reflects the medium-term trend in inflation, as well as the prospect that this component will continue declining.",
        "He/she pointed out that the nature of the shocks that have exerted upward pressure on the non-core component and headline inflation should be considered.",
        "He/she reiterated that the effects of said supply shocks tend to dissipate relatively quickly, which would lead headline inflation to resume a downward trajectory in the following months.",
        "He/she also stated that, although it is necessary to acknowledge that non-core inflation at double-digit levels has exerted significant pressures on headline inflation, it is also important to consider that this represents a change in relative prices rather than generalized pressures.",
        "He/she argued that both domestic and external environments are conducive to a continuous moderation of inflationary pressures.",
        "He/she highlighted the disinflation progress at the global level.",

        "He/she added that, domestically, the expected weakness of national economic activity would contribute to mitigate inflation pressures over the planning horizon.",
        "Finally, he/she stated that the level of monetary restriction should be consistent with the fading of pressures stemming from the global shocks, which at the time led to a rise in the reference rate for 15 consecutive meetings, accumulating 725 basis points of increases.",
        "Considering all of the above, he/she noted that this decision should be communicated in the context of progress in global shocks’ fading, and taking into account that the effect of the rebound in non-core inflation on headline inflation is only in the short term, as well as the current level of monetary restriction and that prevailing in the event of an interest rate cut.",
        "He/she highlighted that it will be essential to emphasize that, in line with the central bank's commitment to its primary mandate, the monetary policy stance will continue being clearly restrictive and, therefore, will continue acting to ensure that inflation converges to the 3% target.",
        "He/she estimated that, looking ahead, the inflationary environment will allow to continue discussing reference rate adjustments.",
        "However, he/she acknowledged that a gradual approach will need to be maintained.",
        "Another member commented that both the reversal of shocks associated with the pandemic and geopolitical conflicts as well as a restrictive and timely monetary policy stance by the central bank have allowed for significant progress in the disinflationary process.",
        "However, he/she considered that the outlook for the conduct of monetary policy continues to be very complex in light of the unfavorable inflationary dynamics in recent months.",
        "He/she highlighted that headline inflation has continued increasing due to a greater and longerlasting rebound in the non-core component than expected.",
        "He/she argued that the supply shocks that have led to this rebound will not necessarily dissipate rapidly, potentially contaminating core inflation.",
        "He/she stated that the latter depends, in part, on their effects on inflation expectations, as well as on the monetary policy response.",
        "For this reason, he/she warned that it would be risky to begin a downward cycle when non-core inflation is trending significantly upwards.",
        "He/she pointed out that the recent slower decline in core inflation has occurred despite the monetary restriction.",
        "He/she stated that the forecast of lower inflationary pressures in light of the weakening of economic activity could be offset by the ongoing resilience of aggregate demand.",
        "He/she noted that tensions in financial markets due to idiosyncratic and global factors have added to this complex inflationary dynamic.",
        "He/she indicated that exchange rate pressures could continue and escalate, which could hinder the disinflationary process even in light of the expected slowdown in economic activity.",
        "He/she highlighted that both inflation expectations and the exchange rate have been the two main channels through which monetary restriction has been operating.",
        "He/she noted that since the adoption of a floating exchange rate regime, the pass-through effect has diminished, although this does not mean that exchange rate dynamics are not relevant for the trajectory of inflation.",
        "He/she argued that the pass-through effect can only remain bounded if markets’ confidence in the central bank's commitment to its primary mandate is maintained.",
        "He/she considered that this is an additional reason to conduct monetary policy with caution in episodes of high exchange rate volatility such as the current one.",
        "He/she argued that in this environment an adjustment in the monetary policy stance should not be rushed and, instead, a risk management approach should be favored.",
        "One member considered that the conduct of monetary policy requires analyzing both the observed data and the expected determinants of inflationary dynamics.",
        "With respect to inflation data, he/she pointed out that the recent readings show a differentiated behavior in its components.",
        "He/she highlighted the decline in the core component over since the implementation of the inflation-targeting regime and clearly responds to the monetary restriction.",
        "He/she mentioned that, in contrast, noncore inflation has continued rising due to different supply shocks.",
        "He/she stated that these shocks appear as short-term determinants of inflation; however, since they concentrate in agricultural and livestock product prices, they only have limited indirect effects, provided that expectations remain anchored.",
        "He/she also mentioned, among mediumterm determinants, the weak economic activity data, which could contribute to better behavior of the services subcomponent.",
        "He/she added that two inflation determinants, expectations and the exchange rate, are also the two transmission channels that have performed better in the current cycle and are unlikely to cease contributing to disinflation, provided that an absolute restrictive stance and an adequate relative stance are maintained.",
        "He/she emphasized that a long-term determinant is the central bank's unwavering commitment to reducing inflation towards its target, as shown by the level of monetary restriction attained.",
        "In this regard, he/she recalled that the real ex-ante rate is more than twice the upper limit of the neutral range and that the nominal rate is almost twice the observed inflation.",
        "He/she stated that the difference between the interest rate gap and the inflation gap is one of the highest among the main emerging economies and is the largest if core inflation is considered.",
        "He/she argued that the monetary restriction should also be evaluated in terms of its duration, which is nearing two years and which, he/she considered, will extend throughout the planning horizon.",
        "He/she indicated that, even after taking into account the reference rate adjustment, there will be a stance adequate and consistent with the expected pressures on inflation.",
        "He/she considered that the pauses in May and June allowed to assess both the disinflationary process and the functioning of the transmission channels.",
        "He/she indicated that the monetary policy stance should be as efficient as possible in order to consolidate disinflation and ensure an orderly adjustment of the economy and markets.",
        "In this regard, he/she stated that it should be emphasized that the task is yet to be concluded and that a vigilant approach should be maintained.",
        "He/she commented that it is appropriate to continue with a data-dependent approach in which gradualism prevails.",
        "He/she highlighted that, looking ahead, adjustments may even continue to be spaced out and not proportional to the expected decline in inflation for the remainder of the year.",
        "Another member recalled that in the previous monetary policy decision the target rate remained at persistence in services inflation, inflation expectations above the central bank's forecasts, and a balance of risks for inflation biased to the upside.",
        "He/she mentioned that in the last six weeks, in his/her opinion, data have not improved and suggest an even more complex environment, in which increased uncertainty has not dissipated.",
        "He/she warned that, in an environment in which the expectations channel is the most important, there is a lack of credibility in Banco de México's inflation forecast, given that none of the expectations surveys anticipate reaching the 3% target by the end of 2025 and, on the contrary, they foresee higher inflation levels.",
        "He/she argued that chronic optimism stemming from an inflation forecast targeting framework that considers a target rate determined under the assumption that the 3% inflation target is attained in a horizon of eight quarters should be avoided.",
        "However, he/she pointed out that if this assumption is not imposed, forecast inflation would not be very different from analysts’ expectations, which could be reflecting the perception of a monetary policy that has a low incidence.",
        "Therefore, he/she stated the need to maintain a firm restrictive policy stance, given an inflation that is off the target range.",
        "He/she emphasized that credibility is a central issue, and therefore it is crucial to convey to the public that all possible measures will be taken to meet the inflation target in order for monetary policy to be more effective.",
        "He/she estimated that, with inflation risks to the upside, an increasing inflation trajectory, and unfavorable inflation expectations, the monetary policy stance cannot be eased yet.",
        "He/she considered that the mixed signals from the Federal Reserve regarding further easing, exchange rate depreciation, and the recent volatility in financial markets, should play a secondary role in the monetary policy decision given their limited progress in curbing inflation.",
        "He/she stated that the effects of the external environment on the relative monetary policy stance are yet to be defined.",
        "He/she argued that a premature monetary easing could hinder the attainment of the primary objective and that for this reason the monetary policy stance cannot be adjusted at this time.",
        "He/she pointed out that both international institutions and multiple academic studies warn about the relevance of avoiding a premature easing.",
        "He/she stated that the signal sent by this adjustment would be more relevant than the level of the reference rate itself and that, under the current conditions, lowering the target rate would send the wrong message of being content with rising headline inflation.",
        "He/she added that if services inflation does not show any progress, headline inflation is not declining, and inflation expectations are not more aligned with the central bank's targets, it will be difficult to send signals in another direction.",
        "One member stated that the economy continues facing two shocks that have become more intense and have opposite effects on inflation.",
        "He/she mentioned that, on the one hand, the exchange rate continued registering volatility and depreciated, while, on the other hand, he/she expects a slightly greater easing of slack conditions than previously anticipated in June.",
        "He/she recalled that the passthrough from the exchange rate to prices is low, and that the greater economic slack will help mitigate the risk of a greater pass-through.",
        "He/she added that signs of deceleration would indicate that the shock to economic activity will last longer, affecting the entire monetary policy horizon.",
        "He/she delved into the information suggested by the central bank’s forecast, by reiterating, on the one hand, that the revision to headline inflation is attributed to supply shocks, with the convergence timeline remaining unchanged, and, on the other hand, that core inflation is anticipated to continue decreasing.",
        "He/she highlighted that expectations for core inflation for decreased, which indicates that markets do not perceive that shocks are contaminating core inflation.",
        "Regarding the level of monetary restriction, he/she mentioned that, given the behavior of inflation expectations, the 25-basis point reduction in the reference rate in March has resulted in a decrease of only 9 basis points in the real ex-ante interest rate.",
        "He/she underlined that its level is almost twice the upper limit of the neutral range, making it highly restrictive under any metric.",
        "In view of the shift in the monetary policy outlook in other economies, he/she stated that even with rate cuts, the relative monetary policy stance will continue to be robust.",
        "Considering this solid absolute and relative policy stance, he/she rejected the notion that reductions reflect complacency.",
        "In this regard, he/she commented that a restrictive stance will continue to be essential and, in this regard, he/she considered that the monetary policy stance has margins.",
        "He/she stated that, although at the time it was necessary to take the reference rate to maximum levels, in response to the unprecedented shocks, now the current inflation challenges are of a different nature, given that the higher readings of headline inflation are explained by its non-core component.",
        "In this context, he/she emphasized that convergence to the inflation target and an adjustment to the level of monetary restriction are compatible.",
        "He/she added that reference rate cuts aligned with the central scenario must not be postponed, as there is the risk of managing monetary policy with a lag, incurring unnecessary costs for the economy.",
        "He/she pointed out that monetary policy should be conducted prospectively, considering both the observed and the expected determinants, without overweighting any specific data point.",

        "Our forecasts have once again been adjusted upwards; core inflation decreases ever more slowly; non-core inflation continues at high levels and will likely remain above our forecasts, while the risk of the core component becoming contaminated is not negligible; inflation expectations remain above our forecasts and do not show any signs of inflexion; and the balance of risks continues biased to the upside.",

        "He/she asserted that, despite the recent rebound in headline inflation, the balance of risks has improved compared to that prevailing at the end of that the risks that currently prevail are more akin to those observed in previous inflationary episodes, as opposed to the atypical shocks faced in the aftermath of the pandemic, and thus their materialization would have more limited effects on inflation.",
        "Among upward risks to inflation, the majority underlined the persistence of core inflation at high levels.",
        "In this regard, some members stated that services inflation will likely continue exhibiting some downward rigidity.",
        "One member pointed out that such rigidity may be the result of services prices not having compensated the totality of the increases observed in the production costs.",
        "Another member mentioned that the decline in merchandise inflation could also stagnate due to, among other factors, the deceleration in the decline of global inflation.",
        "Most members warned about the possibility of greater cost-related pressures of various nature.",

        "He/she stated that, if the cuts in public spending in 2025 turn out to be smaller than those announced, growth would be higher than forecasted.",
        "On the other hand, he/she mentioned that markets expect reference rate cuts in advanced economies to be of greater magnitude than those implied by their central banks’ communication.",

        "One member stated that foreign participants showed interest in short-term instruments.",
        "He/she attributed such interest to investors seeking to take advantage of interest rate levels and the expectation that these will remain relatively elevated throughout the year, compared to those of other emerging countries.",
        "Some members highlighted that in December there was also a significant positioning by foreign investors in domestic government debt.",

        "Nevertheless, it estimated that the outlook is still challenging.",
        "Based on the above, and taking into consideration the monetary policy stance already attained and the persistence of the shocks that the Mexican economy is facing, with the presence of all its members, the Board decided unanimously to maintain the target for the overnight interbank interest rate at 11.25%.",
        "With this decision, the monetary policy stance remains in the trajectory required for inflation to converge to its 3% target The Board will thoroughly monitor inflationary pressures as well as all factors that have an incidence on the foreseen path for inflation and its expectations.",

        "He/she recalled that, during the second half of 2022, although headline inflation was already decreasing, the hiking cycle continued.",
        "He/she stated that this was because such decline was attributed to the decrease in non-core inflation, while the core component continued increasing.",
        "He/she pointed out that it was not until core inflation began to decline markedly that it was deemed that the disinflationary phase had started and that it was unanimously decided to stop increasing the reference rate.",
        "He/she highlighted that currently core inflation continues to decline.",
        "He/she stated that for monetary policy decisions it is important to consider that the increase in headline inflation reflects a change in relative prices of specific products in the non-core component.",
        "He/she added that shocks like the recent ones tend to reverse relatively fast and do not compare to those observed during the pandemic and during the war in Ukraine, which were widespread, deep, and long-lasting.",
        "He/she added that it is foreseeable that headline inflation will resume its downward trend in the following months.",
        "He/she mentioned that, at the next monetary policy decision meeting, depending on available information, the appropriateness of lowering the reference rate can be assessed, taking into account the visible progress in disinflation and, at the same time, the challenges that still persist.",
        "He/she argued that headline inflation remains above target and core inflation continues at relatively high levels despite having declined significantly.",
        "He/she underlined that acknowledging the progress in disinflation and discussing the possibility of lowering the reference rate does not imply that victory has been proclaimed in the fight against inflation, as it is recognized that the task is not yet completed.",
        "He/she stated that the prevailing level of monetary restriction should be weighed against the evolution of inflation and its components, as well as its outlook, considering that the restrictive policy stance that has been maintained as well as the one prevailing in the future will impact the inflation outlook over the horizon in which monetary policy operates.",
        "He/she considered that, given the challenges, whenever macroeconomic conditions allow for cuts in the reference rate, these would be gradual.",
        "He/she emphasized that Banco de México must continue with the cautious approach that has guided its decisions.",
        "He/she underlined that actions will be implemented in such a way that the reference rate remains consistent at all times with the trajectory needed to enable an orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to the 3% target during the forecast period.",
        "This is for the benefit of the country's population, primarily its lower-income segments, which are the most affected by inflationary episodes.",
        "Another member highlighted that, at this monetary policy meeting, it is important to consider that, while core inflation has exhibited a favorable behavior, the risks of a rebound in the non-core component, which would take it to levels closer to its historical average, have started to materialize to such an extent that it more than compensates for the decline that core inflation continues exhibiting.",
        "He/she indicated that, although the central scenario considers that the shocks on relative prices that have affected the noncore component will dissipate in the second quarter of 2024, other risks persist that may jeopardize the foreseen trajectory of inflation towards the 3% target.",
        "In this regard, he/she highlighted the possibility that non-core inflation stabilizes at levels above those forecasted for this component by the central bank.",
        "He/she pointed out that these forecasts anticipate non-core inflation to be at around half of its historical average throughout 2025.",
        "He/she also mentioned as risk factors for the foreseen trajectory for inflation a greater-than-anticipated resilience of the Mexican economy, and possible episodes of depreciation of the Mexican peso during 2024, given internal and external risk factors, as anticipated by some currency market indicators.",
        "Additionally, he/she expressed concern about inflation expectations, both drawn from surveys and implicit in market instruments, not decreasing at the required pace to reach the 3% target.",
        "He/she deemed that, in view of the environment of high uncertainty and the risks to the upside mentioned above, it is fundamental to maintain the attained level of monetary restriction, and therefore in this meeting the reference rate should remain at its current level.",
        "He/she stated that a tone of caution should be maintained in this monetary policy statement, given an environment in which the balance of risks for inflation remains biased to the upside.",
        "He/she warned that the fact that it may be necessary to maintain the current level of the reference rate longer than anticipated by market consensus cannot be ruled out.",
        "Given the prevailing inflationary dynamics, he/she mentioned that it is extremely risky to include forward guidance and therefore, in his/her opinion, a data-dependent approach should be reinforced.",
        "He/she argued that the monetary policy statement should provide flexibility for each of the future decisions, as the economic situation is highly uncertain, both externally and domestically.",
        "Therefore, the central bank should not commit to any adjustment of the reference rate within a specific timeframe.",
        "One member highlighted that, on this occasion, a first reduction in the reference rate should not be considered, given that headline inflation has recently increased, even more than expected, due to the rebound in the non-core component and taking into account that short- and medium-term inflation expectations increased.",
        "He/she also argued that the inflation forecast might be perceived as optimistic since it assumes the increase in non-core inflation is temporary, of which there is no certainty.",
        "He/she considered that the recent surprising inflation and economic activity figures have sent mixed signals for determining the monetary policy stance.",
        "He/she stated that, before beginning a cycle of consecutive reference rate cuts, core inflation and, particularly, its services subcomponent, must show less persistence and consolidate into a downward trajectory, as anticipated by the central bank's forecasts.",
        "He/she mentioned that it will be necessary to make sure that the rebound in non-core inflation does not spill over to core inflation, that monetary policy has its expected impact on aggregate demand and that shocks to non-core inflation are effectively reversed.",
        "He/she pointed out that it is also necessary for inflation expectations to return to the variability interval.",
        "He/she stated that a signal must be sent that efforts to strengthen the anchoring of inflation expectations will not be spared.",
        "He/she underlined that, looking ahead, the current levels of monetary tightening must be maintained.",
        "He/she highlighted that, compared to other countries, monetary policy in Mexico is not as effective, and thus a longer-lasting monetary restriction is necessary.",
        "He/she pointed out that, since the last reference rate increase, a passive tightening of the monetary policy stance has been observed, and stated that the real ex-ante rate has increased by approximately 110 basis points.",
        "In view of the latter, he/she considered that, should the inflation outlook improve significantly, some adjustment to the reference rate could be made in order to maintain a high level of monetary restriction, but without generating excessive astringency.",
        "He/she added that the outlook is very uncertain and therefore caution and prudence in managing monetary restriction should prevail in the next monetary policy decisions.",
        "He/she underlined that any eventual downward adjustment to the reference rate should not be interpreted as the beginning of a monetary easing cycle.",
        "He/she highlighted that, in his/her opinion, it should be communicated that subsequent monetary policy decisions will be completely dependent on the evolution of the data and on the upside risks to inflation not materializing.",
        "Another member stated that during 2023 inflation declined significantly and at a speed that has few precedents.",
        "He/she pointed out that recently there has been a reversion of the non-core inflation while the core one, which is the most sensitive to monetary policy, has continued to decline.",
        "He/she indicated that the Bank’s forecasts suggest that this process will continue, while inflation expectations remain anchored and moving slowly towards their historical averages.",
        "However, he/she warned that the gap between observed inflation and its target remains wide and there are several risks to attaining convergence.",
        "He/she mentioned that, in order to close the inflation gap, the ex-ante real interest rate has remained in restrictive territory since September interest rate has not changed since March 2023, the monetary restriction has increased as inflation and inflation expectations have improved.",
        "He/she pointed out that in order to quantify the level of restriction attained, it’s possible to observe that the difference between the ex-ante real rate and the central estimate of its neutral range is more than double the inflationary gap.",
        "He/she added that, in the past, when inflation was above 4%, the real rate gap was on average less than one time the inflation gap.",
        "He/she underlined that, consistent with the extraordinary shocks that have been faced, the ratio between both gaps is the largest on record during an entire monetary cycle.",
        "He/she pointed out that this measure is also higher than the average currently maintained by both emerging and advanced economies, and even greater than that observed in economies that have shown strong resilience, that have faced episodes of exchange rate stress or that face fiscalrelated pressures.",
        "He/she stated that, looking ahead, given the expected disinflation and the passive increase in the real interest rate, if the reference rate is not adjusted, the ratio between both gaps could increase significantly and above what is necessary.",
        "He/she added that, due to the upward bias in the inflation risk balance, the forecast is still susceptible to revision in that direction, which would imply that room to calibrate the monetary policy stance is limited and will need to be thoroughly assessed in each decision meeting.",
        "He/she highlighted that the approach should be prudent, cautious, flexible and data-dependent.",
        "He/she concluded that in subsequent decisions, if macroeconomic conditions allow, the prevailing level of restriction could be pondered along with the evolution of inflation and its determinants, in compliance with the constitutional mandate, seeking an orderly adjustment of the economy and financial markets.",
        "One member highlighted that monetary policy should respond to the overall trend of the inflation outlook and considered that its improvements allow the discussion of whether it is adequate to make an adjustment to the monetary policy stance.",
        "He/she highlighted the decline of about 380 basis points in headline and core inflations, as well as decreases in the frequency of price revisions, in the fraction of line items with extreme variations and in the central tendency measures.",
        "Likewise, he/she pointed out that, although the balance of risks remains biased upwards, it is less adverse than the one prevailing at the start of 2023.",
        "He/she stated that the degree of monetary restriction attained resulted from the atypical nature of the shocks and risks confronted and reiterated that both have mitigated significantly.",
        "He/she recalled that the rebound in headline inflation is the result of a significant increase in the price of a few products from the non-core component, which is expected to be temporary, and considered it relevant progress that the recent disinflationary process has been guided by the core component.",
        "For that reason, he/she estimated that, in keeping with the tone of caution that has characterized this cycle, in this occasion there is space to adjust the communication so that it captures these improvements as well as the risks that prevail.",
        "On the other hand, he/she noted there has been a passive tightening of around 109 basis points and added that when inflation has been at similar levels, nominal and real interest rates have been well below current levels.",
        "Thus, he/she emphasized that the monetary policy stance is clearly restrictive by any metric, and argued that it will continue being robust even in case of changes in the relative stance.",
        "He/she highlighted that downward adjustments in the interest rate would not prevent the continuation of a restrictive stance, which is necessary given that there is still a distance to cover.",
        "Likewise, he/she mentioned that given that monetary policy operates with lags, it will continue fostering the convergence of inflation and added that the speed with which it is transmitted to the different components is heterogeneous.",
        "In that regard, he/she noted that the inflation of merchandise prices has declined faster than that of services prices, and indicated that the behavior of these last ones is the result of a necessary adjustment in the economy given the distortion of their relative prices.",
        "He/she argued that, the challenge is to adjust the degree of restriction in such a way that it is consistent with an inflation which, although above target, has decreased considerably.",
        "He/she stated that the adjustments to the policy stance will be gradual, given the expected non-linearity of the disinflationary process, which would allow an evaluation of its behavior and the monitoring of the prevailing risks.",
        "He/she indicated that whether such changes are continuous or not, will depend on the evolution of the inflationary outlook as a whole.",

        "It acknowledged the disinflationary process in Mexico.",
        "Nevertheless, it estimated that the outlook is still challenging.",
        "Based on the above, and taking into consideration the monetary policy stance already attained and the persistence of the shocks that the Mexican economy is facing, with the presence of all its members, the Board decided unanimously to maintain the target for the overnight interbank interest rate at 11.25%.",
        "With this decision, the monetary policy stance remains in the trajectory required for inflation to converge to its 3% target within the forecast horizon.",
        "The Board will thoroughly monitor inflationary pressures as well as all factors that have an incidence on the foreseen path for inflation and its expectations.",
        "In the next monetary policy meetings, it will assess, depending on available information, the possibility of adjusting the reference rate.",
        "It will take into account the progress in the inflation outlook and the challenges that prevail.",
        "It will also consider the incidence of both the restrictive policy stance that has been maintained and that prevailing in the future on inflation throughout the horizon in which monetary policy operates.",
        "Actions will be implemented in such a way that the reference rate remains consistent at all times with the trajectory needed to enable an orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to the 3% target during the forecast period.",
        "The central bank reaffirms its commitment with its primary mandate and the need to continue its efforts to consolidate an environment of low and stable inflation.",

        "As a result, he/she considered that medium-term determinants of inflation suggest that the process of convergence will continue.",
        "Nevertheless, he/she commented that, when adjusting the reference rate, the following factors must be taken into account: i) that the monetary policy stance is sufficiently restrictive to ensure the convergence of inflation to its target within the forecast horizon; ii) that it is as efficient as possible to facilitate orderly adjustments in price dynamics, financial markets, and the economy overall; and iii) that it allows the continued management of risks to inflation on both sides of the balance of risks.",
        "He/she considered that throughout the monetary restriction cycle, the response of the reference rate was more than proportional to the increase in inflation in terms of both magnitude and duration.",
        "He/she added that the downward recalibration, which began in March this year, has been both prudent and gradual, aiming to maintain a monetary policy stance that mitigates upward risks to inflation.",

        "headline inflation has resumed a downward trend, more certainty is still needed that progress in the inflation outlook is significant before lowering the reference rate.",
        "He/she warned that long-term inflation expectations have been anchored for some time at levels above target because in the past the central bank did not maintain a restrictive policy stance for the necessary duration to consolidate inflation at 3%.",
        "He/she argued that, in contrast, the previous reference rate cuts were initiated prematurely, and expansionary and accommodative policy stances were maintained when inflation was above target.",
        "In this regard, he/she noted that between 2009 and 2016 the ex-ante real interest rate averaged at levels close to zero.",
        "He/she deemed that the above contributed to generating the perception that the central bank was content with inflation being slightly below 4%.",
        "He/she added that, in the current juncture, core inflation, which reflects the mediumterm trend of inflation, is slightly below 4%.",
        "He/she deemed that, as a result, markets currently anticipate that the existing level of inflation will be tolerated until the end of 2025, leading to a continuous reduction in the reference rate.",
        "He/she pointed out that this new opportunity must now be leveraged to avoid sending the message of complacency as in the past, by prematurely and automatically confirming a ratecutting cycle.",
        "He/she argued that, in contrast, the degree of certainty about an adjustment of the monetary policy stance should be assessed in each decision.",
        "He/she added that emphasis should be placed on core inflation, which is sensitive to monetary policy actions, rather than on non-core inflation, which is highly volatile.",
        "He/she warned that it is necessary to break the persistence of services inflation in order to achieve a further decline in core inflation.",
        "He/she commented that the larger-thanexpected cut to the federal funds rate should be considered within the context of the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate.",
        "He/she stated that since Banco de México has a sole inflation mandate, the evolution of economic activity should not be overestimated in policy decisions, while more certainty is required regarding the direction and magnitude of the new phase in the economic cycle in order to assess if the reaction function needs to be recalibrated.",
        "He/she also reiterated that lack of growth in Mexico is not attributed to the monetary policy stance, but rather to other domestic and external factors.",
        "He/she stressed the importance of attaining the 3% inflation target despite the challenging outlook for the rest of 2024 and for 2025.",
        "He/she indicated that having greater confidence that core inflation continues trending downwards and that the inflationary outlook continues improving will allow assessing the level of monetary restriction needed to reach the inflation target, without undermining the credibility of the commitment to the price stability mandate.",
        "One member recalled that in March the Governing Board decided to begin lowering the reference rate, given the significant progress in the inflation outlook.",
        "He/she highlighted the decrease in both headline and core inflation from their peaks and a less adverse balance of risks compared to previous years.",
        "He/she commented that the disinflationary process has continued albeit with both upward and downward risks, and therefore has considered it congruent to adopt a gradual approach in conducting monetary policy.",
        "He/she added that starting in the June decision, risks to the downside began taking on more significance, and thus since then there were arguments supporting the continuation of adjustments to the monetary policy stance.",
        "He/she stated that the above arguments still hold and new ones have emerged, further widening the room for adjustment.",
        "He/she highlighted: i) that core inflation continues trending downwards and that its trajectory has not been affected by shocks to the non-core component, which have started to reverse faster than anticipated; ii) that the evolution of economic activity continues suggesting an increased slack, as the output gap has closed and is expected to turn negative towards the end of 2024; iii) that in recent weeks volatility in the Mexican peso’s exchange rate has moderated, and although additional episodes of depreciation cannot be ruled out, the risk of a greater pass-through to prices would be offset by other factors, such as the economy's cyclical conditions; and iv) that the magnitude of the Federal Reserve's reference rate cut, previously observed only during periods of marked economic weakness, creates room for adjustment in terms of the relative policy stance, and the signs of a slowdown in the US economic activity and labor market have further implications for demand and for the anticipated slack conditions in Mexico.",
        "He/she estimated that the inflationary context allows to anticipate the continuity in adjustments to the level of restriction.",
        "He/she added that, in the absence of further shocks, discussions could begin regarding the level of reference rate cuts.",
        "He/she emphasized that, given the high degree of restriction achieved, even with additional adjustments, the reference rate will remain restrictive, which will be necessary throughout the forecast horizon.",
        "He/she considered that continuing to adjust the level of monetary restriction is not only timely but also necessary to conduct monetary policy efficiently, while addressing the prevailing risks and considering the progress in the inflation outlook, ensuring that a policy stance aligned with convergence is maintained.",

        "Jonathan Heath voted in favor of maintaining the target for the overnight interbank interest rate at We need to be patient in order for the current monetary policy stance to have the desired effect on the persistence in services inflation.",
        "Furthermore, initiating a cycle of monetary easing prematurely could send a signal of complacency and that we are content with the high levels of headline inflation, since adjustments to the monetary policy stance at the margin are a more relevant signal than the level of the monetary restriction per se.",
        "For the moment, we need a bit more time to confirm the trend the current positive signals seem to suggest as well as to assess if we need to adjust our reaction function given the global cyclical and monetary conditions we will face in the coming months."

        "He/she added that there is a high probability that the current price dynamics do not correspond to those of a high inflation regime.",
        "All members underlined that the decrease in headline inflation has fundamentally responded to the evolution of the non-core component and, to a lesser degree, to the decline in core inflation.",
        "One member noted that of the 3.52 percentage points by which headline inflation decreased between August 2022 and the first fortnight of June, around 75% is attributable to the fall in the non-core component, which declined by 10.6 percentage points during that period.",
        "He/she added that the core component so far has decreased by slightly over 1.5 percentage points since its peak in November 2022.",
        "Another member noted that the disinflationary process will comprise two stages.",
        "The first one, in which inflation decreases but still remains at elevated levels, and the second one, in which it consolidates at levels consistent with its target.",

        "One member added that base effects are also contributing to the above.",
        "He/she mentioned that some estimates that decompose inflation in different time frequencies show that its decline is mainly explained by shortterm factors, while medium- and long-term trends remain affected.",

        "Some members noted, however, that, at the margin, this component showed signs of moderation.",
        "One member mentioned that it decreased slightly during the first fortnight of June, due to a marginal reduction in the inflation of services other than housing and education.",
        "He/she added that inflation of housing and education services remained relatively stable, although at levels above 3%.",
        "Another member noted that the dynamics of services prices improved when considering their seasonally adjusted and annualized monthly variation, which shows a three-month moving average of 3.84% compared to the annual rate of items in the services basket, which currently shows double-digit price variations, is 1.1%, while at the beginning of the year it reached levels of around Some members noted that the high level of services inflation occurs in a context of a strong labor market, in which the demand for services has recovered.",

        "He/she considered that, in any case, this would be one of the factors that have contributed to the persistence of core inflation.",
        "He/she added that, while domestic pressures are typically associated with increases in services inflation, the behavior of the latter currently reflects other factors, such as global shocks to certain components or delayed price increases due to weak demand at the time.",
        "Therefore, he/she estimated that its evolution not necessarily responds to domestic pressures.",
        "He/she stated that, in his/her opinion, the dynamics of services inflation continue reflecting: i) the recovery of this sector in view of the mitigation of changes in consumption patterns, which has led to price increases that had been postponed due to weak demand, and, in this regard, he/she highlighted the increases in education prices; ii) that housing inflation continues being affected by last year's high inflation figures; and iii) that some items continue responding to increases in international references, such as food services.",
        "Regarding this last item, he/she mentioned that the sub-index of services excluding housing, education and tourism is which 213 correspond to food services.",
        "Most members mentioned that non-core inflation remained at historically low levels, reaching 0.03% during the first fortnight of June.",

        "One member rated this as the most concerning risk.",
        "Another member estimated that the above not only responds to the shocks associated with the pandemic and with the military conflict in Ukraine, but also appears to derive from changes in price formation, as shown by the greater frequency and magnitude of goods and services’ price adjustments.",

        "Most members mentioned the risk of a greater-than-expected increase in non-core inflation in the following months.",
        "One member warned that, even with the foreseen increase in non-core inflation, the central bank forecasts would imply that, during the planning horizon, non-core inflation would be below its average of the last 13 years, and thus there is a risk that this indicator registers higher-than-anticipated levels.",
        "Some members mentioned higher prices of agricultural and livestock products, caused by climate-related factors, as an example of risks that could lead to an increase in non-core inflation.",
        "Among risks to the downside, one member mentioned the possibility of a greater-than anticipated slowdown in global economic activity, mainly in the United States, and also in Mexico, which would lead to lower domestic inflationary pressures.",
        "All members highlighted the appreciation of the Mexican peso since the previous monetary policy meeting.",
        "Most members noted that the peso- dollar exchange rate reached its lowest level since December 2015 and that trading conditions in the foreign exchange market have been due to the country's sound macroeconomic fundamentals and the wide volatility-adjusted interest rate spread between Mexico and the United States.",
        "One member added that the yield in domestic currency implied on foreign exchange forwards being above the reference rate reflects that the Mexican peso is attractive to investors.",
        "Some members considered that remittance inflows and better investment prospects in view of the nearshoring process have also contributed to the favorable behavior of the national currency.",

        "However, one member noted that the stock market registered a negative performance at the margin.",
        "Some members underlined that there has been a recovery in the percentage of Mexican Federal Treasury Certificates (Cetes, for their acronym in Spanish) held by foreign investors.",
        "One member stated that non-resident holdings of bonds decreased since the last decision as a result, in part, of an increase in the cost of foreign exchange hedging and of profit taking from positions given the appreciation of the Mexican peso during this year.",
        "He/she indicated that pension and mutual funds have been the main buyers of government bonds this year.",
        "He/she noted that the increase in employer’s contributions has increased the resources managed by the Specialized Investment Companies for Retirement Funds (Siefores, for their acronym in Spanish) and, in turn, the demand for different assets, including government debt and corporate securities.",
        "Most members mentioned that the pass-through of increases in the reference rate to commercial bank deposit rates has contributed to incentivize Mexican households to save through term deposits.",
        "Some members indicated that commercial banks' performing credit to private firms and households has continued to expand, especially for consumer credit.",
        "One member noted that delinquency rates remain relatively low and stable, although a marginal increase in those of credit cards has been observed.",
        "Regarding the financial cycle, he/she added that the financial conditions index for Mexico has trended upwards so far this year, and therefore financial conditions remain tight, although at stable levels.",
        "Another member pointed out that credit to large issuing firms decelerated in a difficult environment for issuing securities in foreign markets.",
        "He/she pointed out that this stands in contrast with the expansion of domestic financing to private firms.",
        "The Governing Board evaluated the magnitude and diversity of the inflationary shocks and their determinants, along with the evolution of medium- and long-term inflation expectations and the price formation process.",
        "It considered that the disinflationary process is underway given that diverse pressures have eased.",
        "Nevertheless, it deemed that these continue having an incidence on inflation, and thus it remains high.",
        "Also, that the inflationary outlook is still very complex.",
        "Based on the above, and considering the monetary policy stance already attained, with the presence of all its members, the Board decided unanimously to maintain the target for the overnight interbank interest rate at 11.25%.",

        "He/she pointed out that there is always uncertainty about the pace at which shocks may dissipate and that some inflation components may exhibit volatility.",
        "He/she highlighted that the reference rate should be maintained at its current level for a period that is long enough to ensure that inflation declines in a sustained manner and that the upward bias of the balance of risks for inflation moderates.",
        "He/she stated that it is still too early to consider the possibility of interest rate cuts.",
        "He/she noted that the monetary policy stance attained needs more time to continue operating.",
        "He/she pointed out that it will be essential to continue analyzing the observed and forecasted behavior of inflation and its components, as well as of all its determinants.",
        "Among these, he/she highlighted inflation expectations, cost-related pressures, domestic economic activity, labor and financial market dynamics, as well as external factors such as world inflation, global economic activity, and international monetary policy.",
        "He/she highlighted that it is necessary to closely monitor a wide range of economic and financial variables.",
        "He/she argued that during this inflationary period, monetary policy has contributed to the anchoring of inflation expectations, mainly long-term ones.",
        "He/she mentioned that, despite the magnitude of the shocks, they have remained relatively stable, which has been essential for the disinflation process to begin.",
        "He/she added that monetary policy has contributed to the resilient behavior of the Mexican peso.",
        "He/she stated that this has eased inflationary pressures by moderating the costs of imported inputs used by the productive sector.",
        "He/she noted that it has also contributed to moderate the rate of expansion of external demand faced by the export manufacturing sector, which shows high levels of capacity utilization.",
        "He/she added that monetary tightening has fostered a process of intertemporal substitution of household spending.",
        "Finally, he/she reiterated that Banco de México remains firmly committed to its primary mandate of price stability.",
        "He/she stated that this is to the benefit of the country's population, particularly those with lower incomes.",
        "Another member considered that, in view of the prevailing inflationary pressures, it is essential to preserve the level of monetary restriction attained in order to promote the decline of inflation in line with the central bank's projections and mitigate inflationary risks.",
        "He/she thus considered it appropriate to maintain the reference rate at its current level of 11.25%.",
        "He/she stated that the high uncertainty environment regarding the inflationary process compels Banco de México to act with caution and favor a flexible monetary policy stance subject to incoming data.",
        "He/she noted that subsequent monetary policy decisions will depend on incoming data, particularly on headline and core inflation consolidating their downward trend as expected, and on domestic pressures not generating persistence.",
        "He/she added that the central bank must clearly state that it is prepared to respond to the circumstances.",
        "He/she pointed out that it cannot be ruled out that the level of monetary restriction attained should be maintained for longer than anticipated or that a greater or lesser tightening may be required.",
        "He/she stated that, in any case, a restrictive stance should be maintained throughout the planning horizon.",
        "He/she mentioned that the monetary policy statement should highlight that the favorable evolution of inflation has mainly responded to external factors, while domestic pressures have persisted and may hinder the convergence of inflation to its target within the forecast horizon.",
        "Finally, he/she warned that the accumulated lag in physical investment and lower productivity, both worsened by the pandemic, may have lowered the country’s potential growth, which constitutes a risk factor for inflation that, in his/her opinion, will have significant implications for monetary policy conduction in the short and medium terms.",
        "He/she warned that if the country’s potential growth has fallen and in the absence of a restrictive monetary policy, the economy could be on its path towards an equilibrium of low growth and high levels of inflation.",
        "Looking ahead, the possibility of lower potential growth could make it difficult to observe high growth rates without inflationary pressures being generated.",
        "One member considered it necessary to maintain the reference rate at its current level for an extended period in order to achieve convergence of inflation to its target.",
        "He/she recalled that this was communicated since the previous meeting, in which it was transmitted that, according to the information available, the terminal rate had already been attained.",
        "He/she considered that, in an environment of lower external pressures, monetary restriction is having an effect.",
        "He/she pointed out that a necessary but not sufficient condition to overcome this inflationary episode was that global pressures would begin to ease.",
        "He/she stated that now domestic pressures must be contained by maintaining a restrictive monetary stance.",
        "He/she mentioned that efforts should focus on further reducing core inflation.",
        "He/she stated that the relative monetary policy stance allows for some room for maneuver to focus exclusively on the inflationary outlook, even if the US Federal Reserve were to raise its reference rate on several occasions.",
        "He/she mentioned that, since the last reference rate increase in March, the ex-ante real interest rate has risen by 20 basis points due to the fall in 12-month inflation expectations, which is equivalent to almost an additional increase in the reference rate if expectations had not declined.",
        "However, he/she pointed out that the monetary stance must be prevented from becoming too restrictive given the expected decline in inflation expectations.",
        "He/she highlighted that the expectations channel will be crucial in the upcoming months, together with the materialization of larger effects on the monetary aggregates and other transmission channels.",
        "He/she underlined that it is important to continue guiding markets on the temporality of forward guidance and the nature of any possible adjustment in the reference rate.",
        "He/she warned that it is too early to believe that the interest rate cuts which are anticipated by market indicators for the end of 2023 will materialize.",
        "He/she stated that the term \"extended period\" should remain undefined until there is greater certainty about an improvement in the inflationary outlook.",
        "He/she pointed out that, instead, it will be important to maintain caution when discussing the desirable timing to initiate a normalization cycle and underlined that the environment is still complex and fragile.",
        "He/she highlighted that Banco de México will remain committed to its primary mandate through a firm stance until the inflation target is attained.",
        "Another member pointed out that, although inflation keeps improving, most of its decline is attributed to the non-core component and to important base effects that are unlikely to operate indefinitely.",
        "He/she noted that, although the reference rate has not been adjusted, the ex-ante real interest rate has been increasing.",
        "He/she estimated that this is expected to continue occurring, although to a limited extent, given that inflation expectations tend to decline slowly.",
        "He/she considered that the effectiveness of the monetary policy stance will depend on the functioning of the transmission channels, which, in his/her opinion are operating in the required direction, particularly with regards to the exchange rate channel.",
        "He/she added that, as in other monetary cycles, the tightening of financing conditions and the rise in funding costs have not increased in the same proportion as the reference rate, and therefore the magnitude and lag with which they will influence the behavior of domestic demand still need to be evaluated.",
        "He/she argued that monetary restriction will require a prolonged period to be properly transmitted, since the lags with which different channels operate are ample and differ from each other.",
        "He/she stated that such restriction must ensure: i) the consolidation of an orderly and sustained trend of headline and core inflation to a level of 3%; ii) a neutral balance of risks for the forecast, and iii) inflation expectations adjusting to their historical averages.",
        "He/she considered that, in view of the complex inflationary scenario, these conditions are not yet resolved, and therefore it is necessary to maintain a flexible and data-dependent approach.",
        "He/she expressed the need for communication to provide clear signals in a timely manner and to avoid inconsistencies that could damage the central bank's credibility.",
        "He/she warned that the reference rate foreseen by fixed-income markets for the end of 2023 and 2024 is below the level required to guarantee the convergence of inflation to its target over the forecast horizon.",
        "He/she pointed out that, at this moment, anticipating changes in the monetary cycle would be premature.",
        "He/she indicated that, in contrast, providing clear communication on the commitment to the constitutional mandate of price stability can contribute to an adequate formation of expectations and reduce some of the lags with which the transmission mechanisms operate.",
        "One member considered that the monetary tightening attained has contributed to the disinflation process.",
        "He/she argued that given the persistence of core inflation and a balance of risks biased to the upside, maintaining the reference rate at its current level allows to continue evaluating the degree of absorption of the monetary policy stance in the economy.",
        "He/she added that although the transmission channels are operating and their effect will be more noticeable in the coming quarters, the atypical nature of the shocks and their implications on inflationary dynamics strengthen the need for an extended pause.",
        "He/she reiterated that, although domestic pressures tend to be associated with increases in services inflation, the latter is still affected by the described shocks and is not necessarily explained by domestic pressures.",
        "He/she added that if such pressures were present, these would already be addressed with the monetary restriction achieved.",
        "He/she stated that the significant adjustment to the inflation forecast at the beginning of the year in part responded to the anticipation of greater pressures on services, including those stemming from the greater dynamism of the labor market.",
        "He/she asserted that the firm and timely action implemented at that policy meeting also sought to address such dynamics, although he/she also highlighted the need to monitor its evolution.",
        "On the other hand, he/she considered it prudent to refrain from taking actions that could diminish the effectiveness of the accumulated adjustment or of communication as a policy tool that would relax the monetary stance prematurely.",
        "For this reason, he/she stated that currently it is not appropriate to discuss the possibility of interest rate cuts.",
        "He/she estimated that, although better readings in inflation expectations are anticipated, which is important to observe under the inflation targeting regime, the referred pause will allow said expectations to continue evolving favorably and contribute to improve the price formation process.",
        "He/she added that, among a wide range of factors, it is also relevant to consider the evolution of the balance of risks, the development of inflation with respect to the forecast, and the progression of the forecast itself.",
        "Finally, he/she stated that it is essential to continue using communication as an active tool to strengthen the monetary policy stance.",
        "He/she highlighted that, in his/her opinion, it is still prudent to communicate that the pause will continue for a sufficiently long period to consolidate the convergence of inflation and foster an orderly adjustment of the economy and markets.",
        "The Governing Board evaluated the magnitude and diversity of the inflationary shocks and their determinants, along with the evolution of mediumand long-term inflation expectations and the price formation process.",
        "It considered that the disinflationary process is underway given that diverse pressures have eased.",

        "Most members mentioned that world economic growth moderated during the fourth quarter of 2022.",
        "They agreed that this was due to the negative effects of the military conflict in Ukraine, the resurgence of infections in China, and tight monetary conditions.",
        "Some members considered that there are signs of disturbances in international trade.",
        "One member noted that forward-looking indicators of manufacturing and services for this year are at contraction levels.",

        "He/she recalled that, given a complex outlook, in the previous monetary policy decision it was determined that for the following meeting an additional increase in the reference rate would be required.",
        "He/she argued that, although some elements of the economic and financial environment have performed as anticipated, given the unfavorable dynamics of inflation, especially of its core component, in this meeting, it is prudent to continue with the same pace of upward adjustments to the reference rate as in the previous meeting.",

        "He/she highlighted, as domestic inflationary pressures, consumption dynamics, the labor market tightening, and the high inflation expectations.",
        "He/she underlined the significant persistence of core inflation and concerns over the positive correlation between high inflation and its greater persistence.",
        "In this context, he/she argued that the proposed 50-basis point adjustment to the reference rate is necessary to achieve the convergence of inflation to the target in the forecast horizon.",
        "He/she added that it would send a clear signal of commitment to the constitutional mandate.",

        "Regarding the monetary policy statement, he/she added that it is necessary to highlight the deteriorated inflationary dynamics, especially the resistance of the core component to decline, the balance of risks to the upside, the upward revision in inflation forecasts, and the still high level of inflation expectations.",

        "He/she suggested that it must indicate that, depending on the evolution of incoming data, further increases could be required.",

        "He/she argued that the current monetary policy decision and the accompanying communication will be important for the formation of market expectations.",
        "He/she stated that the main monetary authorities at the global level, as well as Banco de México, should communicate more clearly that high inflation, above its targets, could be more persistent than previously anticipated.",
        "He/she pointed out that, in such a case, it would be necessary to maintain the tight monetary policy stances until inflation and its expectations show a sustained downward trend.",
        "He/she added that a clear and timely communication must contribute to adjust reference rate expectations.",
        "This, considering the unfounded optimism that prevails at the global level, including in Mexico, claiming it is possible to return to the inflation target with lower rates.",
        "One member argued that, given the highly complex inflationary outlook, a recalibration of monetary astringency is required.",
        "He/she mentioned that the convergence of inflation to its target requires the core component to follow a sustained and decreasing trend, especially the food merchandise inflation.",
        "He/she pointed out that these prices are the main reference for the public to form their expectations.",
        "He/she noted that the synchronization of inflationary cycles between Mexico and the United States required similar adjustments in reference rates, but the inflation differential has now increased.",
        "He/she argued that a 50-basis point increase would indicate that the priority is to control inflation in Mexico, rather than maintaining an interest rate differential.",
        "He/she argued that, given the lesser weight of the relative stance, the adjustments to the rate differential will result in changes to the absolute stance.",
        "He/she stated that such stance must continue to be determined independently, without aiming for a specific level of the relative stance, while being careful that this last one does not reach an overly restrictive level.",
        "He/she noted that the change from global to domestic pressures justifies a restrictive monetary policy stance for longer than anticipated.",
        "He/she mentioned that the increase proposed in this decision would be unexpected, and that therefore it should be clearly justified.",
        "He/she considered that the absolute monetary policy stance, measured through the ex-ante real interest rate, can be characterized by seven stages of the current monetary cycle.",
        "He/she stated the first three stages were determined by the sequential increases of 25, 50 and 75 basis points in the reference rate, which consolidated a restrictive monetary policy stance.",
        "He/she mentioned that the fourth stage began in December 2022 with a gradual slowdown in the pace of upward adjustments and will end when the terminal interest rate level is eventually attained.",
        "He/she stated that its calibration is important, given that it would remain fixed for an extended period and would be subject to the evolution of incoming data.",
        "He/she indicated that a balance must be pursued between avoiding an early deceleration of the pace of reference rate increases without previously observing a significant improvement in the inflationary outlook and reaching a terminal rate that is higher than necessary.",
        "He/she mentioned that a fifth stage will begin when the terminal rate is achieved.",
        "He/she pointed out that during said stage the ex-ante real interest rate will increase as inflation expectations decrease.",
        "He/she added that, to prevent the monetary policy stance from becoming too restrictive, it will be necessary to proceed to the sixth stage.",
        "He/she explained that, during said stage, the reference rate must begin declining alongside inflation expectations, in order to maintain an ex-ante real interest rate above 6%, but without exceeding 7%.",
        "He/she expressed that during the last stage a neutral monetary policy stance would be adopted, once the inflation target is reached.",
        "He/she underlined the importance of forward guidance throughout these stages.",
        "He/she indicated that it should be highlighted that the forward guidance is data-dependent and that it does not represent an unwavering commitment.",
        "He/she added that it should be communicated that the central bank is currently close to reaching the terminal rate, but highlighting that the restrictive monetary policy stance will not yield until commitment with the primary mandate is fulfilled.",
        "Another member pointed out that the most recent data on inflation and to a greater extent, their incidence in the expected determinants, defy the anticipated convergence and represent a clear signal that the balance of risks remains biased upwards.",
        "He/she found it worrisome that the observed decline in inflation of some merchandise has been characterized by being very gradual, due to the fact that there is an asymmetric and lagged passthrough between inflationary global pressures and the final consumer prices in the economy, specially within the set of food merchandises.",
        "He/she mentioned that this occurs in parallel to a deterioration of the inflation of non-tradeable goods in the economy, and thus a failure to act preemptively in view of the abovementioned signals, there would be a synchronization of pressures which would imply relevant challenges for the behavior of core inflation during the second half of the year.",
        "He/she considered that, given the significant adjustments in inflation forecasts, which required even the postponement by one quarter of the point-wise convergence to the target, currently it is not feasible to lower the pace of interest rate increases.",
        "He/she recalled that, in an inflation forecast-targeting regime, the monetary policy stance must be consistent with the behavior of the expected inflation determinants, and thus strengthening the restrictive monetary policy will consolidate a stance consistent with inflation convergence.",
        "However, he/she considered that, given the significant adjustment to the forecasts, the proposed increase in the interest rate, and the notably restrictive level attained by the ex-ante real interest rate, the balance of risks for inflation will be compatible with a slower pace of adjustments in future monetary policy decisions.",
        "He/she stated that Banco de México has made unprecedented efforts to consolidate an absolute policy stance that allows to guarantee the convergence of inflation within the forecast horizon, regardless of the relative policy stance.",
        "He/she pointed out that, looking ahead, decisions must remain flexible, dependent on incoming data and on the evolution of the balance of risks, in order to maintain at all times congruence with fulfilling the constitutional mandate.",
        "One member stated that the inflationary outlook continues posing challenges and considered that it is still not appropriate to slow the pace of interest rate increases.",
        "First of all, he/she pointed out that the materialization of the new inflation forecast requires a reference rate that addresses the higher persistence of the core component.",
        "He/she highlighted that it would send a clear signal regarding the commitment to the primary mandate, which would contribute to preserve credibility.",
        "He/she added that this is also relevant for the effectiveness of the inflation forecasttargeting regime.",
        "Second, he/she mentioned that inflation expectations are still negatively affected, although some have decreased at the margin.",
        "He/she noted that the proposed decision seeks to contribute to the reduction of inflation expectations and to preserve the effectiveness of this transmission channel.",
        "He/she highlighted that the reduction in 12month expectations elevates the ex-ante real interest rate, making the increases in the reference rate more effective.",
        "He/she added that monetary policy actions should continue contributing to expectations returning to their historic levels.",
        "Third, he/she indicated that the high levels of inflation could result in more persistence.",
        "He/she mentioned that the proposed increase seeks to address this risk and prevent second-round effects, the future costs of which will probably be greater if no timely action is taken.",
        "Finally, he/she considered that an uncertain environment persists, despite the fact that certain pressures have been mitigated.",
        "He/she added that the convergence of inflation to its target faces considerable challenges.",
        "He/she stated that, although the monetary policy stance is already restrictive, it needs to be reinforced to consolidate the convergence of inflation to its target.",
        "He/she considered that, for the next decisions, it is necessary to take into account the tightening that has been achieved and the fact that monetary policy operates with a lag.",
        "He/she pointed out that, the degree of monetary restriction already attained could increase if inflation expectations decline.",
        "He/she argued that, looking ahead, the pace of adjustments of the reference rate could be modified, and that it is very close to reaching a level that is appropriate to consolidate a disinflationary process in line with the inflation forecast.",
        "The Governing Board evaluated the magnitude and diversity of the inflationary shocks and its determinants, along with the evolution of mediumand long-term inflation expectations and the price formation process.",
        "It considered the challenges stemming from the ongoing tightening of global financial conditions, the environment of uncertainty, the persistence of accumulated inflationary pressures and the possibility of greater effects on inflation, as well as the monetary policy stance already attained in this hiking cycle.",
        "In particular, it deemed that, given the dynamics of core inflation, on this occasion it is necessary to continue with the magnitude of the reference rate adjustment of the previous policy meeting, in order to be in a better position to tackle a still complex inflation environment.",
        "Based on the above, and with the presence of all its members, the Board decided unanimously to raise the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 50 basis points to adjusts to the trajectory required for inflation to converge to its 3% target within the forecast horizon.",
        "The Board will thoroughly monitor inflationary pressures as well as all factors that have an incidence on the foreseen path for inflation and its expectations.",
        "This, in order to set a policy rate that is consistent at all times with both the orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to the 3% target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates as well as with an adequate adjustment of the economy and financial markets.",
        "The Board considers that, given the monetary policy stance already attained and depending on the evolution of incoming data, for its next policy meeting, the upward adjustment to the reference rate could be of lower magnitude.",
        "Victoria Rodríguez, Galia Borja, Irene Espinosa, Jonathan Heath, and Omar Mejía voted in favor of increasing the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 50 basis points to 11.00%.",
        "Dissenting opinion on the monetary policy Domestic price dynamics has become more complex and uncertain.",
        "Inflationary pressures have not given in as we had anticipated in December, and we adjusted our forecast with a balance of risks to the upside.",
        "In view of inflation’s negative surprise to the upside in January, the lower increase in the reference rate adjustment that we foresaw in December for today’s decision was insufficient.",
        "This situation reflects the high uncertainty surrounding the new dynamics of inflation, which shows a greater persistence and greater domestic pressures, as external ones have started to subside.",
        "We must therefore be extremely cautious with our forward guidance.",
        "It must be credible and feasible, without putting the central bank’s reputation at risk and without undermining the effectiveness of communication with markets.",
        "This gains special relevance given the discrepancy between the monetary authorities’ messages of maintaining a restrictive policy stance for an extended period, and more accommodative market expectations.",
        "For this reason, our guide must indicate that the road towards consolidating the convergence of inflation to the target continues and, thus, limiting the next decision by referring to a policy rate adjustment of lower magnitude implies a high and costly risk of correction if the assumptions do not materialize.",
        "Most members indicated that, so far in 2023, global economic activity has registered a higher- than-expected dynamism.",

        "He/she mentioned that economic growth in several economies has not been reflected in a greater volume of international trade, due to the increase in trade restrictions in recent years.",
        "He/she considered that this could imply a shift in the sources of growth, given that domestic and regional determinants are gaining relevance.",
        "Some members indicated that prospects for world growth imply a higher rate of expansion for 2023 as compared to previous forecasts.",
        "Nevertheless, one member recalled that a slowdown with respect to the previous year is still expected.",
        "Another member noted that leading indicators continue pointing towards weakness in manufacturing and, recently, to a deceleration in the services sector.",
        "He/she added that a moderation in the growth rate is also anticipated for 2024.",
        "In the case of the United States, one member pointed out that growth forecasts have been revised upwards considerably.",

        "In this regard, one member mentioned that different indicators in that country point to a better supply-demand balance.",
        "He/she stated that, since the decline in the number of vacancies has not been accompanied by higher unemployment levels, it suggests that it is possible to maintain certain economic dynamism, consistent with a soft-landing scenario.",
        "He/she added that nominal wage growth has trended downwards in the United States, in contrast with the upward trend still observed in the euro area and in the United Kingdom.",
        "Another member considered that wage negotiations have intensified in some strategic industries, such as the automotive industry in the United States.",
        "Most members highlighted that headline inflation continued decreasing in most economies, indicated that it continues being above the central banks’ targets in a large number of economies.",
        "Most members underlined that in some cases headline inflation has slightly rebounded.",

        "Among the risks to world inflation, most members mentioned the possibility of a surge in international commodity prices.",
        "One member highlighted that the global inflationary outlook has become more challenging, given that the risks for inflation’s convergence to the targets have increased significantly.",
        "He/she stated that the above derives from higher global economic growth expected for core inflation, and the reversion of non-core inflation, which had been at historically low levels.",
        "Another member underlined that the international experience proves that the disinflationary process could be nonlinear, given the challenges prevailing in the inflationary outlook.",
        "Most members highlighted that, currently, central banks’ actions are heterogeneous across heterogeneity has intensified given the differentiated evolution across economies.",
        "Another member stated that, insofar as inflation has declined, central banks’ actions have tended to be more cautious, taking into consideration in each case the restriction already achieved, the monetary policy lags, as well as the specific conditions of each economy.",
        "The majority pointed out that most central banks of advanced economies left their reference rates unchanged.",
        "However, one member stated that some of them, such as the European Central Bank and the Central Bank of Norway, raised their reference rates.",

        "One member added that these costs also increased due to the implementation of sanitary measures, the adoption of technology to facilitate remote work, and the increase in real estate rental prices, among other factors.",

        "All members mentioned that inflation is now projected to converge to the target in the second quarter of 2025.",

        "Some members stated that the expansion of the fiscal deficit for 2024 could represent additional inflationary pressures.",
        "One member highlighted some challenges ahead for public finances associated with: i) the fiscal adjustment required to achieve consolidation in the expectation of lower world growth in 2025; and iv) the reduction of fiscal space to increase spending on infrastructure.",
        "He/she argued that the latter is key to increase potential growth and take advantage of the nearshoring process.",
        "In addition, he/she stated that Pemex's situation is a cause of concern for the sustainability of public finances due to its dependence on federal resources.",
        "Some members added as an upside risk to inflation the possibility of greater cost-related pressures.",
        "They considered that those from the labor market could be aggravated by the wage policy.",
        "One member pointed out that insecurity could also affect indirectly firms’ operating costs.",
        "Some members noted the risk that the economy’s resilience leads to a more gradual reduction in inflation than expected.",

        "He/she added that given the prevailing risks, medium and long-term inflation expectations could rebound.",
        "Another member stated that there is the risk of inflation stagnating above the variability range in 2024, given the increasing domestic pressures.",
        "Regarding financing in the economy, one member noted that total financing maintained a moderate pace of growth.",

        "One member mentioned that delinquency rates are at low and stable levels, although a marginal increase has been observed recently in credit card and payroll loans.",
        "Most members stated that, since the last meeting, the Mexican peso traded in a wide range, exhibited volatility, and depreciated somewhat.",
        "They highlighted that this behavior was mainly due to global factors, in particular, to the expectation of a greater monetary tightening by the main central banks of advanced economies, such as the Federal Reserve.",
        "In this regard, one member noted that the volatility and depreciation of the Mexican peso were mainly associated with the generalized appreciation of the US dollar.",
        "Most members pointed out that trading conditions in the foreign exchange market depreciation, the Mexican peso remained stronger than during the first months of the year.",
        "Some members highlighted that the Mexican peso has shown resilience, due to the solid macroeconomic fundamentals and the monetary policy actions.",

        "Another member noted that both markets as well as analysts are assigning a greater probability to the possibility that there are no changes to the reference rate until the beginning of 2024, and that likewise, expectations for interest rate cuts throughout the horizon have moderated.",
        "The Governing Board evaluated the magnitude and diversity of the inflationary shocks and their determinants, along with the evolution of medium- and long-term inflation expectations and the price formation process.",
        "It considered that, although progress in the disinflation process has been made, the outlook is still very complex.",
        "Based on the above, and taking into account the monetary policy stance already attained and the persistence of the shocks that the Mexican economy is facing, with the presence of all its members, the Board decided unanimously to maintain the target for the overnight interbank interest rate at 11.25%.",
        "With this decision, the monetary policy stance remains in the trajectory required for inflation to converge to its 3% target within the forecast The Board will thoroughly monitor inflationary pressures as well as all factors that have an incidence on the foreseen path for inflation and its expectations.",
        "It estimates that the inflationary outlook will be complicated and uncertain throughout the entire forecast horizon, with upward risks.",
        "Thus, in order to achieve an orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to the 3% target, it considers that it will be necessary to maintain the reference rate at its current level for an extended period.",
        "The central bank reaffirms its commitment with its primary mandate and the need to continue its efforts to consolidate an environment of low and stable One member argued that the monetary policy actions implemented, together with the dissipation of shocks, allowed the disinflation process to begin and advance in recent months.",
        "This occurred after the multiple deep and generalized shocks the world has undergone.",
        "He/she stated that monetary policy is operating through all its transmission channels.",
        "He/she underlined the role of the expectations and exchange rate channels.",
        "He/she pointed out that longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable and the Mexican peso has shown resilience, which has contributed to ease pressures on prices.",
        "He/she warned that, although inflation is decreasing, it is doing it from high levels and in an environment in which upward risks prevail.",
        "He/she mentioned that under these conditions, a prudent conduction of monetary policy has implied taking time to allow the achieved monetary stance to continue operating and evaluating the development of the inflationary outlook.",
        "He/she pointed out that under this cautious approach it is essential to analyze the information that is accumulating on the dynamics of shocks and their effects.",
        "He/she added that this is required to avoid reference rate cuts that are premature or implemented faster than necessary and, consequently, that could jeopardize the downward trajectory of inflation.",
        "Taking into account the above, he/she considered that the reference rate should remain at its current level for an extended period.",
        "He/she reflected on the fact that, although inflation figures are below the highest levels observed in the past year, they are still above the central bank's permanent target.",
        "He/she highlighted that this illustrates both the progress that has been made in disinflation, as well as the tasks that still need to be addressed.",
        "He/she stated that in subsequent meetings the Governing Board will remain attentive, as it has been doing, to the evolution of macroeconomic conditions, considering that the road ahead is still lengthy and is not exempt from risks.",
        "He/she noted that the more gradual decline in inflation that is now foreseen could imply that, looking ahead, the reference rate may need to be lowered more gradually, once the disinflationary process allows for such decreases.",
        "Finally, he/she reiterated that the priority when conducting monetary policy must continue to be lowering inflation and consolidating an environment of price stability in Mexico, in line with the central bank's mandate and for the benefit of the Mexican population.",
        "Another member considered that the outlook for inflation has become more complex for the conduct of monetary policy, because of both a more adverse external environment and idiosyncratic factors.",
        "In this context, he/she expressed that it is essential to maintain the level of monetary restriction attained as long as more information and analyses are available to evaluate the need to implement additional adjustments in the monetary policy stance.",
        "He/she stated that the factors supporting the upward revision in inflation forecasts should be explained, and that the balance of risks for inflation has deteriorated in an environment of high uncertainty.",
        "He/she added that in view of the more complex outlook, forward guidance should highlight that a restrictive stance will be maintained for a more extended period than the previously foreseen.",
        "He/she reiterated that it is convenient to maintain the monetary stance in restrictive territory during the entire forecast horizon.",
        "He/she expressed that the fiscal package could generate pressures on aggregate demand.",
        "He/she added that if the fiscal consolidation process contemplated for 2025 is not achieved, given the challenges that this implies, the consequences for inflationary dynamics could be even greater for that year.",
        "He/she mentioned that in a scenario of greater pressures, it will be necessary to maintain the level of monetary restriction for an even longer period than that foreseen in the previous meeting and, going forward, expanding this policy stance could be required, either actively or passively.",
        "He/she added that the best course of action should be evaluated in case inflationary pressures materialize, with the aim to preserve price and financial stability.",
        "One member stated that the current restrictive stance should be maintained for an extended period in order to ensure the convergence of inflation to its target, which is now foreseen for the second quarter of 2025.",
        "He/she highlighted that the disinflationary process faces domestic pressures from a tightening labor market and the dynamism of aggregate demand, in addition to the still uncertain effects of fiscal expansion.",
        "He/she emphasized that the lack of synchronization between the expansionary fiscal policy and a restrictive monetary policy, implies it is necessary to pay attention to: i) the possibility of offsetting the likely effects of this stimulus on aggregate demand; and ii) the possibility that the fiscal stance lasts longer than anticipated, if the fiscal balance reduction projected for 2025 is not of the expected magnitude.",
        "He/she considered that the materialization of these risks could require monetary restriction for a longer period.",
        "He/she added that the monetary cycle should continue focusing on domestic pressures, primarily on the core component, and remain unaffected by changes in the monetary policy stances of other countries.",
        "He/she pointed out that in order to address the risks to inflation and allow the restrictive stance to take full effect, its passive management must continue.",
        "He/she considered that, since the last reference rate increase, the decline in 12-month inflation expectations caused the real ex-ante rate to increase by almost 70 basis points.",
        "He/she pointed out that this passive management should continue until: i) core inflation improves beyond the marginal adjustments it has registered; ii) expectations of headline and core inflation for 2024 consolidate within the variability interval; and iii) the risk of economic overheating is mitigated.",
        "He/she considered that forward guidance should highlight that a restrictive stance will be maintained for an extended period.",
        "He/she indicated that the period in which the nominal interest rate remains fixed should last at least for the rest of the year, with the possibility of extending beyond the first quarter of 2024 if necessary.",
        "He/she expressed that the monetary policy statement should maintain the categorization of such period as \"extended\" and even \"not yet defined”, in order to contribute to the expectation that it is still not possible to accurately forecast the date of the beginning of reference rate cuts.",
        "He/she added that it should also be communicated that the period to reach a neutral stance is still beyond the forecast horizon.",
        "He/she concluded by stating that the increasing domestic risks call for strictly adhering to the primary mandate and, therefore, to a much more restrictive tone in communication.",
        "Another member stated that the disinflationary process is still complex.",
        "He/she noted that various metrics point to a favorable downward trajectory for inflation, while different measures of inflation expectations continue improving.",
        "However, he/she mentioned that inflation’s behavior over the forecast horizon still faces significant challenges.",
        "He/she pointed out that the forecasts had been adjusted upwards for six quarters, and convergence had been postponed for two.",
        "He/she mentioned that such revisions were attributable mainly to a worsening of the expected determinants of inflation, for which there are various sources of uncertainty that maintain the balance of risks biased to the upside.",
        "He/she highlighted that the dynamism of economic activity implies challenges for the monetary policy transmission mechanisms, given a highly dynamic labor market supporting the growth of credit and consumption, in addition to the normalization of expenditure patterns which has fostered a new adjustment of relative prices between merchandise and services, starting at high levels.",
        "Likewise, he/she pointed out that services prices are showing a larger pass-through of accumulated cost-related shocks, due to the greater demand they face, and that in those sectors in which costs have already decreased, market structures have facilitated the continuation of price increases.",
        "For this reason, he/she considered that, given the current environment of high uncertainty, the monetary policy stance should remain restrictive for an extended period in order to continue fostering conditions for inflation to return to its target.",
        "He/she pointed out that the real ex-ante short-term interest rate has continued to increase, that the real ex-post rate of new credit to firms could reach historically high levels, and that the real exchange rate continues working in favor of lower inflation.",
        "He/she considered that monetary conditions are at a sufficiently restrictive level, but that they require time to be adequately transmitted to the economy.",
        "He/she mentioned that while last year's environment of uncertainty required a risk management approach and forceful decision making, the current uncertainty is more associated with the speed at which inflation will converge to its target.",
        "He/she indicated that the monetary policy approach should remain prudent, cautious and gradual.",
        "He/she added that communication should highlight the need for certainty on the observed and expected determinants of inflation, in order to consolidate a trajectory for inflation towards its target, and comply with the central bank’s constitutional mandate.",
        "One member argued that, despite the advances in the disinflationary process, convergence has become slower and the main challenge continues to be the persistence of core inflation, especially that of services.",
        "In this regard, he/she highlighted that, given the weakness of demand that they faced, the passthrough of the increase in costs to services prices has been lower than for merchandise.",
        "Thus, some items of the services sector continue recovering from the effects of the changes in the consumption patterns, on top of which the dynamism of the labor market has also contributed to its persistence.",
        "Likewise, he/she emphasized the relevance of having communicated a prolonged pause and of continuing to be cautious with the stance that has been achieved, given the prevalence of the challenges in the inflationary front.",
        "In this regard, he/she highlighted that, on the one hand, the real ex-ante short-term interest rate is close to 350 basis points above the upper limit of the neutral range and, since September 2022, it has been in restrictive territory.",
        "He/she added that communication has been an important complementary tool that, without being too explicit, has allowed to convey the Governing Board’s view of the inflation outlook to the markets.",
        "He/she pointed out that, under these two axes, the monetary policy stance is expected to continue operating through its different channels.",
        "He/she stated that monetary restriction has favored a recomposition in the holding of assets towards those of longer terms.",
        "He/she added that the Mexican peso has appreciated around 24% in real terms since the beginning of the hiking cycle.",
        "He/she pointed out that, although the nominal reference rate has remained unchanged since last May, there have been no reductions in long-term interest rates or an easing of financial conditions.",
        "He/she considered that this indicates that communication has contributed to avoid a premature easing of monetary conditions.",
        "He/she expressed that all of the above has helped inflation expectations to remain anchored and the adverse effects on their distribution to show improvements.",
        "Thus, in this period of pause, the real ex-ante interest rate has increased, and this passive tightening also allows to handle the various risks that prevail.",
        "He/she considered that, given the risks to inflation, it is pertinent to reaffirm that the reference rate will remain at its current level for an extended period.",
        "He/she stated that, in this way, the monetary policy stance will continue contributing to the disinflationary process consistent with the primary mandate of price stability.",
        "The Governing Board evaluated the magnitude and diversity of the inflationary shocks and their determinants, along with the evolution of mediumand long-term inflation expectations and the price formation process.",
        "It considered that, although progress in the disinflation process has been made, the outlook is still very complex.",
        "Based on the above, and taking into account the monetary policy stance already attained and the persistence of the shocks that the Mexican economy is facing, with the presence of all its members, the Board decided unanimously to maintain the target for the overnight interbank interest rate at 11.25%.",

        "The central bank reaffirms its commitment with its primary mandate and the need to continue its efforts to consolidate an environment of low and stable inflation.",
        "Victoria Rodríguez, Galia Borja, Irene Espinosa, Jonathan Heath, and Omar Mejía voted in favor of maintaining the target for the overnight interbank interest rate at 11.25%",
        "Most members pointed out that the global economy continued growing during the second quarter.",
        "Some members stated that, although this occurred at a slower pace than in the previous quarter, it was faster than expected.",
        "One member mentioned that the above took place in an environment of high uncertainty and of tightening of global monetary conditions.",
        "Most members highlighted that the performance of the global economy has been driven, in part, by the services sector.",
        "In a related manner, some members stated that the favorable evolution of consumption contributed to the resilience of economic activity.",
        "One member added the positive performance of investment in some countries.",
        "Another member indicated that the normalization of global supply chains has also supported world economic growth.",
        "Most members noted that economic growth exhibits heterogeneity across regions.",
        "One member underlined that economic activity in the euro area expanded marginally, while Latin American countries recovered moderately.",
        "In contrast, some members highlighted the resilience of the US economy.",
        "One member pointed out that economic activity figures in the United States have been higher than expected.",
        "Another considered that an unsynchronized deceleration among the various sectors of the US economy has probably prevented an abrupt weakening of aggregate activity, as some sectors have been contracting while others have been expanding.",
        "He/she added that this would be associated with the asymmetric effects of the shocks derived from the pandemic as well as with the various lags with which monetary policy operates, affecting industrial production faster and more notably than tertiary activities.",
        "Some members stated that world growth prospects for 2023 continue implying a deceleration, although slightly less intense than previously anticipated.",
        "One member mentioned that, considering the recent revisions, 3% growth is foreseen for both 2023 and expected slowdown would result, in part, from the dissipation of the effects of the fiscal support provided during the pandemic and the lagged impact of tight monetary conditions; he/she highlighted that this impact has been more apparent in the manufacturing sector, mainly in advanced economies.",
        "He/she mentioned that the balance of risks to global economic activity remains biased to the downside due to different factors, such as the resurgence of concerns over the banking systems in advanced economies and a greater-than-expected weakness in the Chinese economy.",
        "One member noted that favorable revisions to the growth outlook for Asian economies, particularly for China, are not foreseen.",
        "In the case of the United States, one member pointed out that growth forecasts have been revised upwards during this year.",
        "However, another member mentioned that the US economy is still expected to slow down as of the third quarter.",
        "Despite the probability of an upcoming recession has diminished.",
        "One member indicated that, although monetary policy is operating, the economy has adjusted more gradually than in other hiking cycles, and thus, the perception that a soft landing could materialize has increased.",
        "Regarding global labor markets, some members highlighted that these remain tight in several countries.",
        "However, one member argued that labor markets exhibit certain signs of a better balance between supply and demand.",
        "He/she pointed out that US non-farm payroll growth kept moderating, while the labor force continued trending upwards.",
        "He/she underlined that nominal wage growth has stabilized in the United States, in contrast to the euro area and the United Kingdom, where it is still trending upwards.",
        "All members indicated that although headline economies, it remains at high levels.",
        "Most members highlighted that it still lies above central bank targets in a large number of economies.",
        "They attributed the decrease in global headline inflation to lower pressures on mentioned that, overall, inflation is expected to converge to its target between 2024 and 2025.",
        "One member stated that the convergence process is still subject to high uncertainty.",
        "Most members highlighted that, globally, the core component has shown resistance to decline.",
        "One member pointed out that this component continues exhibiting persistence, which may still be reflecting effects of the shocks from the pandemic, geopolitical tensions and tight labor markets, which overall have led to a pass-through of costs to consumers.",
        "Nevertheless, another member considered that there are a number of differentiated dynamics among economies.",
        "He/she stated that, for example, in the United States, lower contributions of services to core inflation have been observed, while services inflation continues trending upwards in the euro area.",
        "Among the risks to the global inflation outlook, some members mentioned the possibility of a surge in international commodity prices, especially following Russia's exit from the Black Sea grain export deal.",
        "As an additional risk, one member added the climate-related factors affecting various crops around the world.",
        "In addition, he/she warned about the possibility of disruptions in production chains, especially of semiconductors, in view of the trade tensions between China and the United States, and in the context of a high demand for such inputs by the technology sectors associated with artificial intelligence.",
        "Most members pointed out that central banks of the major advanced economies raised their reference rates.",

        "One member stated that the Bank of Japan adjusted its yield curve control program, raising the upper limit for its long-term interest rate.",
        "Nevertheless, most members considered that central banks in advanced economies appear to be nearing the end of their hiking cycles.",

        "Another member added that these institutions reiterated their commitment to maintain high interest rates for an extended period.",
        "As for emerging economies, some members stated that in most of these economies the monetary authorities left their reference rates unchanged, while some adjusted them downwards.",
        "All members mentioned that the central banks of Brazil and Chile lowered their reference rates in response to specific macroeconomic conditions in each economy.",
        "One member underlined that in both cases headline inflation has been declining.",
        "He/she pointed out that in Brazil inflation has been below 4.75% since March, which is the upper limit of the tolerance band, whereas in Chile economic activity has weakened considerably.",
        "Another member noted that, although inflation in Chile has not converged to the central bank’s target, as it has in Brazil, the high level of unemployment and the outlook for lower growth motivated the interest rate cut.",
        "One member stated that these economies typically have more pronounced monetary policy cycles.",
        "Some members indicated that, in light of the particular macroeconomic conditions faced by each country, monetary policy is likely to remain heterogeneous at a global level.",
        "One member argued that this heterogeneity responds, in part, to the focalization of the diverse monetary tightening cycles.",
        "All members mentioned that, in its July meeting, the US Federal Reserve increased the target range of the federal funds rate by 25 basis points.",
        "One member noted that this is consistent with the median of the most recent projections by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members.",
        "Some members highlighted that the chairman of that institution argued that interest rate decreases would take place once a sustained downward trend in inflation is confirmed.",
        "One member underlined that the chairman of that institution does not deem it appropriate to make interest rate cuts this year.",
        "Another member pointed out that, in addition, he indicated that they no longer expect a recession for this year.",
        "Some members stated that even an additional increase is possible during the remainder of 2023.",
        "Most members pointed out that international financial markets have recently registered volatility.",
        "They explained that this volatility was mainly caused by concerns regarding the fiscal situation in the United States.",
        "Nevertheless, they indicated that the downgrade in US credit ratings had a moderate effect on markets.",
        "One member underlined that the revisions to expectations regarding the end of the monetary authorities' restrictive cycle in advanced economies also contributed to the recent financial volatility.",
        "Some members highlighted that financial markets’ sensitivity to economic data has increased due to the data-dependent approach that a number of central banks have stressed.",
        "Most members underlined the greater risk aversion and higher volatility registered during the period.",

        "Some members stated that the effects have also been felt in foreign exchange markets.",
        "In this regard, some members mentioned the recent appreciation of the US dollar.",
        "In this context, one member forewarned that the high levels of public debt accumulated after the pandemic, along with tight financial conditions, could undermine governments' ability to repay.",
        "He/she added that further downgrades in sovereign credit ratings could pose a risk to global economic growth and financial stability.",
        "All members highlighted that the Mexican economy has shown resilience.",
        "Most members pointed out that, according to GDP flash estimates, the economy registered higher-than- anticipated growth during the second quarter of the year.",
        "One member added that this would imply an expansion for the seventh consecutive quarter, something not seen since the end of 2015.",
        "Most members pointed out that said growth was driven by the three major sectors of the economy.",
        "In particular, they highlighted the performance of industrial production and services.",
        "One member noted that growth was supported by domestic spending.",
        "He/she underlined the contribution of greater investment in public infrastructure projects and growth in those subcomponents of services which had lagged behind the most during the post pandemic recovery process.",

        "Regarding the determinants of consumption, one member mentioned that, although remittances in US dollars remain at high levels, their value in Mexican pesos and in real terms has decreased during the year, and thus, in his/her opinion, this factor hardly explains the current dynamism of household spending.",
        "In contrast, he/she indicated that the strengthening of the labor market could indeed be supporting consumption, especially that of services.",
        "He/she added that the National Survey of Household Income and Expenditure (ENIGH, for its acronym in Spanish) suggests that there has been a reallocation of resources towards lower income deciles, which have a higher marginal propensity to consume, possibly contributing to a higher-than-expected growth in domestic spending.",
        "Most members stated that investment maintained its pace of recovery.",
        "One member mentioned that there was a significant reactivation of non-residential construction.",
        "Some members highlighted that, during the second quarter of 2023, the value of exports decreased slightly with respect to that observed in the previous quarter.",
        "Despite the aforementioned, some members noted that exports remain at high levels.",
        "One member argued that Mexico's increased share in US imports has offset the effects of the slowdown in total US imports.",

        "He/she argued that the high uncertainty regarding the inflationary process and a balance of risks biased to the upside make it necessary to continue operating cautiously, favoring a flexible monetary policy stance, dependent on incoming data.",
        "He/she pointed out that for this reason maintaining the level of monetary restriction longer than expected or even that a further tightening is required, cannot be ruled out.",
        "He/she stated that the monetary policy statement should acknowledge that the favorable evolution of inflation has mainly responded to external factors and to the non-core component, and that, on the contrary, domestic pressures may hinder the convergence of inflation to the target.",

        "He/she mentioned as a first factor the accumulated lag in physical investment and the fall in productivity, which may have reduced the potential growth of the economy.",
        "He/she estimated that, if this were the case, inflationary demand pressures could materialize even when traditional estimates of the output gap do not indicate an overutilization of productive capacity.",
        "He/she noted as a second factor Pemex's financial situation given its possible impact on public finances, financial stability, and the exchange rate.",
        "He/she stated that these two factors reinforce the convenience of maintaining the monetary policy stance in restrictive territory during the entire planning horizon.",
        "He/she expressed that this is a necessary condition not only to induce the convergence of inflation to the target, but also to manage the risks associated with such convergence.",
        "One member stated that, despite its improvement, the inflationary outlook continues facing domestic and idiosyncratic risks and structural factors, which calls for maintaining the current level of the reference rate for an indefinite period.",
        "He/she considered that, given the increasing domestic pressures on inflation, monetary policy should continue considering the international context as a secondary factor.",
        "In this regard, he/she mentioned that there is still a wide interest rate spread between Mexico and the United States, and that global risks are contained.",
        "He/she noted that although the exchange rate has contributed to mitigate external price-related pressures its level is not a goal in the decisionmaking process.",
        "He/she argued that the beginning of monetary easing in some emerging economies responds to contexts different from that of Mexico, and therefore cannot be taken as a reference to determine the central bank's policy stance.",
        "He/she warned that in light of the still high level of headline and core inflation expectations for 2024, it is essential to stress that a restrictive stance will be maintained to ensure the anchoring of inflation expectations.",
        "He/she argued that it will be important to monitor that the effects of this stance are fully transmitted to the economy.",
        "He/she warned that several analysts as well as markets are discounting cuts in the reference rate before the end of 2023.",
        "However, he/she pointed out that it is still premature to consider a possible cut, even in the case of a finetuning to avoid an overly restrictive stance.",
        "He/she noted that, for now, the further tightening of the restrictive stance will continue through passive monetary policy management.",
        "He/she estimated that normalization towards a neutral stance is foreseen beyond the forecast horizon.",

        "He/she stated that, for this reason, it is essential that such guide signals that the inflationary problem has not yet been resolved and that it stresses the commitment to the primary mandate of price stability.",
        "Another member considered that the disinflation process continues to advance, although some elements that have worked in favor of convergence may contribute less towards the end of the year, and the balance of risks remains biased to the upside.",
        "He/she pointed out that the nature of the observed shocks starting with the pandemic has led to an environment of high uncertainty which could extend the lag with which monetary policy operates.",
        "He/she noted that these lags are considerable and may not be stable throughout the entire horizon.",
        "He/she highlighted that the greater resilience of the economy may suggest a more gradual transmission of monetary policy onto domestic demand which contributes to a slower decline in the core component.",
        "He/she noted that the latter could be explained, among other factors, by the normalization of consumption patterns and the growth of tertiary activities, which tend to be less sensitive to interest rates than other sectors.",
        "He/she mentioned that the better performance of the economy has also contributed to ease tighter credit conditions and to maintain the prices of various assets at high levels, which has caused credit channels and asset prices to operate slowly.",
        "He/she pointed out that, despite this, monetary policy has tightened further through both the increase in the ex-ante real interest rate and the behavior of the real exchange rate.",
        "He/she indicated that the level of restriction attained is contributing to the anchoring of inflation expectations and to the disinflationary process.",
        "However, he/she argued that monetary restriction will still require an extended period to be adequately transmitted and to guarantee: the consolidation of an orderly and sustained trajectory of inflation to the 3% target, a neutral balance of risks around the inflation forecast, and an adjustment of inflation expectations towards their historical averages.",
        "Considering all of the above, he/she deemed that the reference rate should be maintained at its current level.",
        "He/she warned that expectations implicit in the fixed income market anticipate a cycle of cuts in the reference rate for which is not consistent with the expected behavior of economic activity.",
        "He/she expressed that, in this environment of high uncertainty, communication must underline that the stance will continue to be flexible and data-dependent in order to comply with the constitutional mandate.",
        "One member considered that the solid stance adopted by Banco de México has contributed to the disinflationary process.",
        "However, he/she noted that, despite better inflation readings and its more favorable outlook, there are elements that make it convenient to continue with a cautious approach and maintain the reference rate at its current level for an extended period.",
        "He/she argued that since there is a stance consistent with inflation’s convergence and monetary policy operates with lags, the effects of this monetary tightening should be allowed to continue having an incidence on the economy, which appears to be operating at its potential.",
        "He/she considered that the persistence of core inflation as well as the fact that the balance of risks remains biased to the upside, in an environment of high uncertainty, are an important challenge, and thus new shocks cannot be ruled out.",
        "Likewise, he/she stated that, although they have remained anchored, inflation expectations are still affected, and during this pause period, improvements in their readings will continue to be observed.",
        "He/she highlighted that this period will also allow us to analyze the effects of the shocks associated with the global inflationary episode on how the economy operates, not only in the short term, but also its possible impact in the long term.",
        "He/she also stated that the level of restriction attained is sufficiently robust in light of possible adjustments in the stance relative to other economies.",
        "He/she indicated that Banco de México's timely and decisive actions have allowed it to implement a more gradual tightening cycle than in other emerging economies, but in a more timely manner than in advanced economies.",
        "In this regard, he/she stated that the pace of normalization of monetary cycles is foreseen to be heterogeneous.",
        "Regarding forward guidance, he/she highlighted that it has allowed to transmit Banco de México's vision of the inflationary outlook effectively.",
        "He/she added that, without being too explicit, it has contributed to strengthen the monetary policy stance.",
        "He/she delved into the fact that, in view of the prevailing uncertain and complex environment, a moderate and effective use of forward guidance should be pursued, in order for it to consolidate as a vehicle to facilitate the understanding of monetary policy actions looking ahead.",

        "He/she pointed out that more forceful measures were adopted as compared to those historically implemented by Banco de México, highlighting the last four 75 basis points increases.",
        "He/she stated that, through these actions, the ex-ante real interest rate reached levels above the interval estimated as neutral, and that the nominal reference rate reached a level above observed inflation, placing it at a clearly restrictive level.",
        "He/she argued that a delicate balance is being confronted.",
        "On the one hand, he/she mentioned the signs of improvement in the inflationary environment, such as the decline in headline inflation and the fact that it has recently been lower than expected.",
        "On the other hand, he/she warned that core inflation continues increasing and that the balance of risks remains biased to the upside.",
        "He/she added that, with the proposed rate increase, the upward adjustments would shift from 75 basis points to one of 50 basis points, acknowledging the signs of improvement in the inflationary outlook, as well as the cumulative increase in the reference rate during this hiking cycle, whereas continuing to raise the reference rate implies that the environment remains complex and that Banco de México will not be forbearing.",
        "He/she considered that, just as in the two previous years, it is difficult to assign probabilities to how different shocks may evolve, and therefore a robust monetary policy is required, suitable under different scenarios.",
        "He/she considered that the 50basis-point upward adjustment proposed during this meeting would be a robust action, as it would place the central bank in an adequate position to adjust the pace of increases in whichever direction is required, considering that abrupt changes in the magnitude of reference rate adjustments, although at times are necessary, could potentially cause financial volatility.",
        "He/she added that the proposed adjustment would also take into account the importance of gradualness and data dependence under conditions of uncertainty.",
        "He/she added that, looking ahead, both caution and flexibility will be required to adjust the monetary policy stance in line with the scenario that materializes.",
        "He/she concluded that further monetary policy tightening and the level that the reference rate reaches will be contingent on incoming data and its assessment.",
        "Another member stated that the restrictive policy stance reached so far justifies a reduction in the pace of tightening.",
        "He/she pointed out that Banco de México’s inflation forecasts were adjusted marginally, and thus inflation is expected to be close to reaching its peak.",
        "However, he/she indicated that the observed pressures that drove inflation to maximum levels in over two decades have been more generalized and persistent than anticipated.",
        "He/she indicated that, although the narrative to explain the price dynamics in Mexico has focused on external price-related shocks, such as those related to disruptions in global supply chains and the military conflict in Ukraine, it should also be acknowledged that signals of domestic inflationary pressures are becoming increasingly more evident, mainly those related to consumption.",
        "This is evidenced by the fact that, whereas economic activity is barely reaching its pre-pandemic levels, different aggregate consumption indicators are already clearly above those of the reference period.",
        "He/she pointed out that, despite the cumulative monetary adjustment of at very high levels, indicating that the restrictive monetary policy stance will need to be maintained for a longer period, in order to avoid inflation expectations from becoming unanchored and to guarantee the convergence of inflation to its target in the planning horizon.",
        "He/she added that the complex and uncertain environment requires maintaining a cautious and firm monetary policy.",
        "He/she stated that there is now a greater risk that inflation will decline faster in the United States than in Mexico.",
        "He/she argued that this could imply larger increases in Banco de México’s reference rate for a longer-thanforeseen period.",
        "He/she pointed out that it is essential that the monetary policy statement maintains a firm language and explicitly mentions that a reduction in the pace of upward adjustments does not imply the beginning of an easing cycle.",
        "He/she added that, on the contrary, it must communicate that, based on available information, it is still considered necessary to maintain a restrictive monetary policy stance over the planning horizon, and until a decreasing and sustained trajectory of inflation is observed and inflation expectations return to levels close to the 3% target.",
        "He/she pointed out that the monetary policy statement must continue mentioning that the reference rate will continue increasing and that the magnitude of upward adjustments will be determined based on available information.",
        "He/she stated that far from limiting the room for maneuver in the next monetary policy decisions, such language would contribute to monetary policy’s effectiveness and, therefore, minimize the costs of the disinflationary adjustment.",
        "One member considered that raising the policy rate is appropriate in order to prevent second-round effects in the price formation process and the unanchoring of inflation expectations.",
        "However, he/she added that, although in the current context a restrictive monetary policy stance is required, it is necessary to reduce the pace of upward adjustments significantly and consider the risks to economic activity and financial stability of implementing an excessively restrictive monetary policy.",
        "He/she warned that, in an emerging economy such as Mexico’s, the materialization of such risks could affect the price formation process through a more depreciated exchange rate and a deterioration of macroeconomic fundamentals and of productive capacity.",
        "He/she stated that the ex-ante real interest rate is unequivocally in restrictive territory.",
        "He/she added that it should be taken into account that, given the lag with which monetary policy operates, insofar as inflation expectations decrease, the level of monetary tightening is anticipated to continue increasing automatically as long as monetary easing does not begin.",
        "He/she mentioned that, considering the limits of a restrictive monetary policy to control inflation, the level of monetary tightening that has already been reached and the signs of inflationary pressures easing both globally and locally, there is no need to raise the interest rate much further.",
        "He/she highlighted that Mexico is one of the few emerging economies where further increases in the monetary policy rate are being considered.",
        "He/she stated that it is surprising that more increases are anticipated, considering that: i) inflation has remained contained as compared to other economies; ii) inflation has already started to decline; and iii) domestic inflationary pressures are minimal given that economic activity has not grown at an accelerated pace and has just returned to its prepandemic levels.",
        "He/she highlighted that, from an international perspective, and based on a domestic risk-management approach, raising the reference rate much further is not required.",
        "He/she sustained that, looking ahead, it will be necessary to act with caution depending on the evolution of the economy.",
        "Another member considered it appropriate to slow the pace of upward adjustments as the terminal interest rate of this cycle is closer.",
        "He/she noted that it is possible considering: i) the level of monetary tightening that has already been reached; ii) that it is likely that inflation has already reached its peak; iii) that the balance of risks for the trajectory of inflation has slightly improved; iv) that the deterioration of inflation expectations appears to be decreasing; and v) that the anticipated trajectory for inflation has remained stable for the short term.",
        "He/she stated that the reduction in the pace of upward adjustments should not be interpreted as monetary easing, but rather as the implementation of less extreme and aggressive, but still firm, adjustments in view of the considerable challenges and mixed signals of relief and deterioration that must be cautiously considered.",
        "In this regard, he/she indicated that the 50-basis point increases in previous tightening episodes have been considered as forceful.",
        "Thus, he/she argued that further raises are required, given that: i) the core component that responds more to monetary policy remains to the upside; ii) inflation expectations remain high and with the risk of stabilizing at the upper limit of the target range; and iii) domestic pressures which could complicate the convergence of inflation prevail.",
        "He/she warned that cyclical conditions, rather than justifying less monetary tightening, should be considered as an element of caution.",
        "He/she mentioned that the monetary policy stance reached a degree of tightening that is consistent with the inflationary challenge, and that, looking ahead, an ex-ante real interest rate of around that said gradualness will depend on: i) core inflation following a clear downward trend; ii) inflation expectations showing less deterioration, with a lower dispersion, and with a correction of its current upside bias; iii) a consolidation of the expected trajectory for inflation and without it presenting significant adjustments, which would strengthen the central bank’s credibility given the consistent errors in the forecast in the recent past; and iv) the room for maneuver offered by the global monetary conditions.",
        "He/she pointed out that the weighting of these factors, based on incoming data, will define the reaction function.",
        "He/she stated that a 600-basispoint interest rate spread has been maintained between Mexico and the United States, due to the synchronization of the inflationary cycles, and not due to a mechanical relationship.",
        "He/she pointed out that the monetary policy stance in both countries has responded to a similar behavior of inflation.",
        "He/she added that monetary policy synchronization should continue as long as the trajectories of inflation are similar and there is no certainty as to the levels of the terminal interest rates.",
        "He/she stated that sound macroeconomic fundamentals could allow a marginal reduction of the spread in case the inflationary cycles diverge.",
        "He/she pointed out that forward guidance should be communicated in a decisive manner and should highlight that the attained terminal rate will be maintained for some, still uncertain, amount of time.",
        "He/she underlined that, for this reason, it is necessary to be cautious in determining it.",
        "He/she added that neither a monetary easing is to be anticipated over the next months nor that the attained monetary tightening will prevail over the entire horizon in which monetary policy operates.",
        "One member mentioned that there are elements suggesting that the balance of risks for inflation, despite remaining biased to the upside, has started to be distributed closer around Banco de México’s central forecast.",
        "Among these factors he/she mentioned that: i) inflation has begun registering declining pressures, although it remains at high levels and the core component shows a worrying persistence to the upside; ii) inflation figures have reached levels below those anticipated by specialists, whose expectations have started to decline; iii) the central bank inflation forecasts have been revised marginally and indicate that inflation will continue declining over the following quarters.",
        "He/she added that the factors mentioned should be considered in determining the reaction function, taking into account the lag with which monetary policy operates.",
        "He/she stated that, for this reason, the pace of rate adjustments should be of a smaller magnitude.",
        "He/she added that, if the distribution of corresponding distribution of the ex-ante real interest rate is, entirely in a restrictive territory.",
        "He/she argued that the above indicates that the monetary policy stance has consolidated at a sufficiently high level, even under the most pessimistic scenarios.",
        "He/she underlined that, with the suggested upward adjustment, the reference rate would continue increasing, despite having already exceeded both observed and expected inflation levels, which would send a signal of the central bank’s commitment to guaranteeing the convergence of inflation in accordance with its forecasts.",
        "He/he added that the Mexican economy is highly integrated both financially and economically with the rest of the world, and operates under a flexible exchange rate regime, and that for this reason maintaining a fixed relative monetary policy stance could lead to keeping Mexico’s price formation process dependent on external factors.",
        "Therefore, he/she highlighted that Banco de México’s decisions should be consistent with reaching an absolute monetary policy stance that would contribute to the convergence of inflation to its target, regardless of the relative monetary policy stance that this implies.",
        "He/she stated that, looking ahead, the ex-ante real interest rate is likely to continue increasing, while, at the same time, a greater tightening derived from the real exchange rate might be observed; and that, therefore, monetary conditions as a whole will remain tight for some time.",
        "He/she indicated that, in the future, adjustments to the reference rate will have to be calibrated with caution, considering the monetary policy stance that has already been reached, its transmission mechanisms, and the lags with which monetary policy operates.",
        "The Governing Board evaluated the magnitude and diversity of the shocks that have affected inflation and its determinants, along with the evolution of medium- and long-term inflation expectations and the price formation process.",
        "It considered the challenges for monetary policy stemming from the ongoing tightening of global financial conditions, the environment of uncertainty, the inflationary pressures accumulated as a result of the pandemic and the geopolitical conflict, the possibility of greater effects on inflation, and the monetary policy stance already attained in this hiking cycle.",
        "Based on these considerations, the Board decided by majority to raise the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 50 percentage points to 10.50%.",
        "With this action, the monetary policy stance adjusts to the trajectory required for inflation to converge to its 3% target within the forecast horizon.",
        "The Board will thoroughly monitor inflationary pressures as well as all factors that have an incidence on the foreseen path for inflation and its expectations.",
        "This, in order to set a policy rate that is consistent at all times, with both the orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to the policy operates as well as with an adequate adjustment of the economy and financial markets.",
        "The Board considers it will still be necessary to raise the reference rate in its next monetary policy meeting.",
        "Subsequently, it will assess if the reference rate needs to be further adjusted as well as the pace of adjustments based on the prevailing conditions.",
        "Victoria Rodríguez, Galia Borja, Irene Espinosa, and Jonathan Heath voted in favor of increasing the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 50 basis points to 10.50%.",
        "Gerardo Esquivel voted in favor of increasing the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 25 basis points to 10.25%.",
        "The current ex-ante real interest rate is clearly at a restrictive level.",
        "Moreover, given the lag under which monetary policy operates, as inflation expectations start decreasing, the restrictive level is foreseen to increase even further.",
        "The restrictive policy stance already attained, together with easing inflationary pressures, suggests that further raising the reference rate is unnecessary.",
        "The decline in global inflationary pressures is evident.",
        "At the local level, inflation dynamics have also started to ease: there are less pressures at the margin, headline inflation reached its peak in August, and producer price inflation has rapidly decreased.",
        "The latter will eventually have an incidence on core inflation.",
        "Several emerging economies have concluded their hiking cycles or at about to end them with marginal upward adjustments.",
        "Mexico is one of the few economies that has still not concluded such cycle.",
        "In countries with high levels of inflation or inflation that has been affected by demand-related factors, it would be justified to continue with said policy.",
        "However, that is not Mexico’s case.",
        "For this reason, I believe a 25basis point increase is appropriate.",
        "What is now needed is to allow the already attained restrictive policy stance to operate.",
        "Most members highlighted that during the first quarter of 2023, global economic activity recovered compared to the fourth quarter of 2022.",
        "Some members pointed out that this was due to the better functioning of supply chains, to lower pressures on energy prices, and to the reopening of China’s economy.",
        "Most members noted that labor showing signs of tightening.",
        "However, some members expressed that in the United States there are signs of lesser pressures.",
        "One member stated that in the major economies, there was a moderation in nominal wage growth.",
        "Most members pointed out that world growth prospects for 2023 continue pointing to a deceleration compared to 2022.",
        "One member stated that lower growth is expected in advanced economies, while emerging economies are anticipated to face difficulties associated with a moderation in their external demand, a higher debt service, a lower fiscal margin, and high inflation.",
        "He/she added that indicators related to world trade volume have already shown certain signs of weakness, while timely indicators of manufacturing and services show a differentiated behavior, with the latter displaying greater dynamism.",
        "Another member stated that, in some systemically important economies, a recession cannot be ruled out.",
        "However, he/she noted that a slight recovery in global economic activity is still expected for 2024.",
        "Among global risks, some members mentioned tighter monetary and financial conditions.",
        "Some members added the worsening of geopolitical tensions and challenges to financial stability.",
        "Most members stated that headline inflation continued decreasing in a large number of economies, although they warned that it still remains at high levels.",
        "They attributed this decline to lower reference prices for food and energy.",
        "One member added that the mitigation of shocks and global monetary tightening have also contributed to the fall in inflation.",
        "However, most members highlighted that the core component continues showing resistance to decline.",
        "In this regard, one member considered this behavior a matter of concern.",
        "He/she noted that tight labor markets are one of the factors keeping inflation at historically high levels.",
        "Another member pointed out that in some countries it still does not show an inflection point.",
        "One member highlighted that in some economies it showed certain moderation.",
        "Finally, some members indicated that, in several economies, inflation is expected to converge to its target until the end of 2024 or in early 2025.",
        "Most members considered that central banks are in the final phase of their hiking cycles.",
        "They highlighted that several monetary authorities have already stopped increasing their reference rates.",
        "In this regard, one member stated that the main emerging economies that have already paused their hiking cycle accumulated on average underlined that several central banks have communicated that high rates for an extended period will be necessary to achieve the convergence of inflation to its target.",
        "One member added that the fact that the authorities had used specific tools to deal with the risks to the stability of the financial system which resulted from the events in the banking sector, has allowed central banks to focus on fighting inflation.",
        "All members mentioned that, at its May meeting, the US Federal Reserve raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points.",
        "Most members stated that for the next meeting, analysts and market participants foresee a pause.",
        "Most members considered that the tightening of credit conditions due to problems in the banking sector contributed to this projection.",
        "Most members noted that market instruments are pricing in interest rate cuts during the second half of 2023.",
        "They highlighted that, in contrast, the chairman of the Federal Reserve stated that, given the current inflation projections, they do not foresee cuts in 2023 and that they will maintain a data-dependent stance.",
        "One member added that surveys conducted among analysts indicate that interest rate cuts would occur until next year.",
        "Most members mentioned that, after the financial turbulence generated by the banking sector events in previous months, international highlighted that this was due to the timely intervention of authorities in the affected economies.",
        "Some members noted that the environment of lower risk aversion was reflected in gains in the main stock market indexes, in a depreciation of the US dollar, and in moderate increases in medium- and long-term interest rates.",
        "However, one member stated that, in view of the US debt ceiling negotiations, the fixed-income market in that country exhibited volatility.",
        "Most members considered that risks to global financial markets persist.",
        "Some members pointed out that tighter global financial and credit conditions could prevail.",
        "Most members stated that, in the context of a complex external environment, the Mexican highlighted that, according to the GDP flash estimate for the first quarter, economic activity increased its rate of expansion and growth was higher than expected.",
        "One member stated that this means that the national economy would have registered six consecutive quarters of positive growth, something unseen since 2016.",
        "However, another member reckoned that the balance of risks to growth is biased to the downside.",
        "One member pointed out that the latest information suggests a slowdown starting in the second quarter of the year.",
        "Most members noted that the performance of the Mexican economy during the first quarter was supported by both the services and industrial expansion of services was generalized during the first two months of 2023, being observed in eight out of its nine subsectors.",
        "Regarding the components of the services sector, another member highlighted the greater dynamism of those related to retail; transportation and mass media information; finance and real estate; and accommodation and food preparation services.",
        "However, most members noted that industrial activity has lost momentum in recent months.",
        "In particular, they highlighted the moderation in manufacturing production.",

        "Most members highlighted that in the first two months of the year private consumption continued showing dynamism, driven mainly by the consumption of services.",
        "One member mentioned that its level is historically high.",
        "However, another member pointed out that consumption of goods showed a slight reversion in February.",
        "One member noted that there has been a greater dynamism in the consumption of imported goods compared to that of domestic goods, possibly due to the appreciation of the real exchange rate since the start of the hiking cycle in 2021.",
        "Most members warned that, looking ahead, some timely indicators suggest a moderation of private consumption.",
        "Regarding investment, they noted that it continued increasing, supported by the machinery and equipment component, although one member considered that it still shows a significant lag.",
        "Another member pointed out that, overall, investment in construction is sluggish.",
        "One member noted that residential construction remained at low levels, while another member highlighted the growth of non-residential construction.",
        "In the context of lackluster investment, one member considered necessary to establish conditions for the country to take advantage of the nearshoring phenomenon.",
        "He/she argued that this would help counteract the foreseen cyclical weakness of external demand.",
        "He/she added that, from a longer-term perspective, it would allow the country's productive capacity to increase.",
        "Regarding the external sector, some members pointed out that manufacturing exports showed moderate growth during the first quarter of the year.",
        "intermediate goods have continued contracting, while non-automotive exports have weakened.",
        "However, another member considered that the latter have been recovering after the decline observed at the end of 2022.",
        "He/she added that automotive exports have remained stable and at relatively high levels.",

        "Meanwhile, most members highlighted the relatively high magnitude of wage revisions.",
        "One member noted that the nominal annual variation of the daily wage of IMSS-insured workers has remained at levels above 11%, while contractual wage revisions have accelerated, with those of private sector companies standing out, at levels of 8.9%.",
        "Another member warned that minimum wage increases are foreseen to have a greater effect on the average wage, given that, according to the latest figure reported as of March, 35% of the employed population already receives up to one minimum wage.",
        "Most members noted that the output gap continues narrowing.",
        "They highlighted that it is not statistically different from zero.",
        "One member commented that he/she expected the point estimate, which is slightly below zero, to remain negative this year and the next.",

        "All members highlighted that since the last monetary policy meeting, annual headline inflation continued decreasing.",
        "Most members argued that various inflationary pressures are easing.",
        "However, most members emphasized April.",
        "They considered that its decline was mainly due to the evolution of non-core inflation.",
        "Some members pointed out that, more recently, the core component has also contributed.",
        "One member noted that, since February, biweekly inflation data has been below the analysts’ consensus.",
        "He/she mentioned that in April the monthly variation of headline inflation was negative, something unseen in the previous two years, while the annual variation of practically all of its components and subcomponents fell.",
        "Another member added that, when analyzing the seasonally adjusted and annualized monthly variations of headline inflation and its two components, these have trended downwards.",
        "He/she mentioned that the fraction of the consumption basket showing variations greater than 10% has decreased.",
        "He/she stated that indicators, such as the trimmed mean, suggest that the performance of most inflation components, except for the services sub-index, has improved.",
        "One member argued that the downward trajectory of inflation seems to be starting to consolidate, although its decline has been slow and marginal so far.",

        "Most members stated that its monthly variation has declined.",
        "Some members noted that in April it was closer to its 10-year average.",
        "One member added that some indicators related to its monthly variations confirm a deceleration beyond base effects and a less generalized growth.",
        "He/she indicated that close to 50% of the consumption basket of goods and services within the core component already registers an annualized monthly inflation below 5%.",
        "However, most members considered that core inflation shows persistence.",
        "Some members stated that, although inflation has declined, it is mainly due to favorable external factors.",
        "They warned that, in their opinion, there are domestic inflationary pressures that could hinder the convergence of inflation.",
        "One member pointed out that the transition to domestic pressures is a pattern observed in most countries.",
        "Another member stated that this could be attributed to the fact that: i) housing is facing supply-related pressures accumulated over several years; ii) the rest of services may be affected by the normalization of consumption patterns and the pass-through of cost related pressures; and iii) the labor market shows tighter conditions and relevant wage dynamics in an environment of high inflation.",
        "Most members pointed out that merchandise inflation has been decreasing.",
        "One member noted that it is currently below the double-digit levels that were observed for nine months.",
        "Another member noted that this decline is due to the better functioning of global supply chains and to the moderation of price pressures on various inputs.",
        "Some members mentioned that both the food and non-food merchandise subindices have decreased.",
        "One member pointed out that both components accumulated four and five months of declines, respectively, although they remain at high levels.",

        "Most members pointed out that, in its latest reading, services inflation decreased.",
        "One member stated that said decrease was mainly due to the behavior of tourism-services inflation, which reflected seasonal factors.",
        "Some members also mentioned that services inflation continues showing persistence.",
        "Some members also underlined that it remains high.",
        "Regarding its components, most members noted that the annual price variations of housing and education services still do not show a downward inflection.",
        "One member shared a reflection on the behavior of services inflation.",
        "First, he/she stated that its increase partly reflects the recovery of this sector given the reversal of changes in consumption patterns generated by the pandemic.",
        "Second, he/she noted that inflation in education services has already stopped increasing and considered that the increase in this component at the beginning of the year was likely a one-off event, although it will continue having an impact on the annual inflation of services due to base effects.",
        "Third, he/she pointed out that housing inflation continues being affected by last year's high inflation figures, as this component is highly sensitive to the observed inflation readings and tends to reflect them with a lag.",
        "Fourth, he/she pointed out that some of the services components have been affected by the global shocks that have exerted pressure on inflation, as is the case with food services, although these have recently shown a downward trajectory in their seasonally adjusted and annualized monthly variations.",
        "However, another member warned that the prices of some services, indeed, such as food services, are still increasing at double-digit rates.",
        "Most members mentioned that annual non-core 2.12% in April.",
        "They added that this decrease is explained by reductions in the annual variation of both energy and fruit and vegetable prices.",
        "One member noted that, since January, inflation of these components accumulated a significant fall of member indicated that non-core inflation has reflected more immediately the mitigation of external pressures on food and energy prices.",
        "Some members pointed out that non-core inflation is registering unusually reduced variations that, looking ahead, cannot be deemed permanent.",
        "One member stated that the April figure was one of the lowest in historical terms and was the lowest reading since December 2020.",
        "Most members pointed out that longer-term inflation expectations remained relatively stable.",
        "However, they stated that these are at levels above the target.",
        "Some members considered that they still do not show a downward trend.",
        "Regarding short-term expectations, some members mentioned that inflation expectations for the next 12 months and for 2023 declined.",
        "One member pointed out that the survey conducted among analysts indicates that the probability that headline inflation ends the year above 5.5% has decreased.",
        "Another member noted that the median of expectations for the next points from its highest reading during the current inflationary episode.",
        "Most members mentioned that breakeven inflation has declined.",
        "One member said that it remains at levels incompatible with the inflation target.",
        "Another member pointed out that, in light of the reductions exhibited by this indicator since March, the inflation risk premium has fallen to levels close to its historical average.",
        "Most members mentioned that forecasts for headline inflation were revised marginally downwards for some quarters, while those for core inflation remained practically unchanged.",
        "They noted that inflation is still projected to converge to the target in the fourth quarter of 2024.",
        "One member noted that the marginal revisions were made because observed inflation has remained slightly below Banco de México's forecasts at the March meeting.",
        "However, he/she warned that inflation forecasts drawn from surveys and market instruments are above the central bank's projections for practically all of 2024.",
        "Another member expressed that the moderation of pressures on international food and energy prices will eventually be transmitted to the prices of goods and services of the core component.",
        "He/she mentioned that a more significant decline in inflation continues to be anticipated, due to both the mitigation of global shocks and to the monetary policy actions implemented.",
        "One member noted that inflation in the United States has shown signs of easing, which favors the disinflation process in Mexico.",
        "All members considered that the balance of risks for the trajectory of inflation within the forecast horizon remains biased to the upside.",
        "One member added that said balance has not deteriorated.",
        "He/she stated that, nevertheless, there is still uncertainty associated with the foreseen trajectory of inflation.",
        "Another member indicated that the projected trajectory should continue to be validated with observed data.",
        "He/she considered that the road to inflation convergence remains fragile, lengthy, and difficult.",
        "Among upward risks to inflation, some members noted the persistence of core inflation at high levels.",
        "One member added that, although a rapid fall in headline and core inflation is projected as of the third quarter of this year, it may not occur, even after the monetary tightening attained, due to the persistence of inflation that has been observed.",
        "In this regard, another member pointed out that this could compromise the anchoring of inflation expectations.",
        "He/she expressed concern about the persistence of merchandise inflation and the significant increase of services inflation, which may imply that various shocks have still not been fully assimilated.",
        "One member mentioned that the configuration of inflationary pressures continues to pose challenges for the future, given that the decline in inflation is mainly supported by the non-core component.",
        "In this regard, some members pointed out the risk of pressures on energy prices and on agricultural products’ prices.",
        "One member added that the noncore component could be affected by climaterelated shocks, given the possible arrival of the _El_ following its low readings, non-core inflation could observe a reversion to its mean, hence exerting pressure on headline inflation.",
        "In addition, some members pointed out the risk of greater cost-related pressures.",
        "Specifically, some members mentioned the increase in wages in the context of a strong labor market.",
        "However, one member underlined that recent estimates of the Phillips curve for Mexico suggest that it exhibits a relatively mild slope.",
        "He/she argued that the above implies that labor market dynamics are not the main inflation determinant at this time.",
        "Instead, he/she considered that those determinants associated with supply and with inflation expectations represent the main channels through which pressures have accumulated, and thus, in his/her opinion, these would also be the means to achieve convergence, and for that reason, inflation expectations must remain anchored.",
        "As an additional upward risk, another member mentioned possible episodes of foreign exchange depreciation.",
        "Among risks to the downside, one member highlighted the possibility of a greater-than-anticipated deceleration of the world economy.",
        "Most members highlighted that, since the previous monetary policy meeting, domestic financial markets, in line with international ones, performed better.",

        "He/she expressed that the terminal rate has been attained, without implying that there will not be a further adjustment or that this is the end of the monetary restriction, since the monetary policy is now shifting from an active policy management, involving nominal rate increases, to a new phase of passive policy management, determined by the decline in inflationary expectations.",

        "Similarly, he/she pointed out that, if inflation were to decline, an overly restrictive policy stance should be avoided, and, therefore, an interest rate cut would be eventually considered.",
        "He/she pointed out that this would not be a monetary easing, but rather an adjustment to maintain the exante real interest rate in a range between 6 and 7%, which, by his/her estimation, is consistent with convergence of inflation to the target.",
        "He/she added that future intentions should be made known by means of a forward guidance, specifying these are subject to incoming data and, thus, do not represent a fixed commitment.",
        "He/she mentioned that, although it is venturesome to announce that the restrictive stance will be maintained throughout the horizon in which monetary policy operates, it is crucial to communicate that such stance needs to be maintained for an extended period.",
        "He/she considered that progress in the communication strategy has been fundamental for the public to get to know the central bank’s reaction function and to strengthen the formation of expectations.",
        "He/she added that such progress has not responded to circumstantial issues, but instead has been the result of intense discussions and an analysis of the academic literature and of international best practices.",
        "He/she highlighted that it is key to continue working so that, through a clear, direct and transparent communication, which is fundamental for the efficient management of inflation expectations, the primary mandate is fulfilled.",
        "Another member pointed out that the attained interest rate level is historically restrictive, both in nominal and real terms, which he/she deemed consistent with the unprecedented inflationary pressures that have been observed.",
        "He/she mentioned that, given this stance, the analysis should focus on the evolution of the monetary policy transmission mechanism.",
        "He/she stated that: i) starting 9 months ago, a rebalancing in the asset portfolio of the private sector has been observed, with a substitution of liquid assets for longer-term instruments, especially among households, which implies that the interest rate channel is operating and gaining traction; ii) in the current cycle, financing interest rates have increased more than in other episodes, and bank lending conditions have also tightened considerably, which suggests that credit conditions are stringent; iii) in contrast to other monetary cycles in which the real exchange rate depreciated abruptly, this channel is acting in a highly restrictive manner; iv) the asset price channel, which in Mexico tends to be weak, has operated through the increase in the nodes of the yield curve since the beginning of the tightening cycle, affecting the prices of debt instruments, which have decreased significantly; and v) inflation expectations remain anchored and, at the margin, have gradually reversed their negative impacts, a trend which will allow further strengthening of the monetary stance.",
        "For this reason, he/she considered that all channels are working in the right direction to bring inflation back to its target over the forecast horizon.",
        "He/she underlined that the configuration of inflationary pressures is still fragile, and that the high levels of uncertainty increase the importance of maintaining a flexible and datadependent approach.",
        "He/she indicated that communication must be clear to enable an adequate formation of expectations and an orderly behavior of markets, which continue discounting cuts in the reference rate in the near future, an expectation that he/she considered is not compatible with the convergence of inflation to its target in the planning horizon.",
        "He/she forewarned that it should be communicated that the restrictive policy stance will last for a period necessary and sufficient to confirm: i) a clear and downward trend of headline and core inflation towards 3%; ii) a neutral balance of risks around the forecast; and iii) inflation expectations returning to their historical averages.",
        "He/she explained that the above is key to ensure the fulfillment of the constitutional mandate.",
        "One member added that the hiking cycle began in a timely manner and Banco de México responded forcefully to the significant deterioration of the inflation outlook.",
        "He/she pointed out that, following a significant accumulated increase of 725 basis points in the reference rate, it is reasonable to make a pause in the hiking cycle and evaluate the degree of absorption of this monetary tightening in the economy.",
        "The above, considering that, although inflation still remains elevated, signs of easing of price-related pressures can be observed, and such restriction will continue to have an effect during the following quarters.",
        "He/she added that the short-term ex-ante real interest rate is at a clearly restrictive level.",

        "He/she pointed out that, in this horizon, two stages can be distinguished.",
        "In the first stage, which is already taking place, the monetary policy rate affects the channels through which it operates.",
        "In the second stage, which will start to become more evident, the impact of the channels is reflected on inflation and its determinants.",
        "He/she highlighted that one of the most relevant transmission channels is that of inflation expectations.",
        "He/she underlined that shorter-term ones have already stabilized, while longer-term ones, which affect the price formation process to a greater degree, have remained anchored.",
        "He/she pointed out that the monetary adjustment has been transmitted along the entire real yield curve and in market interest rates for the different segments.",
        "It has also enabled a change in households’ asset holdings towards longer-term instruments, which affects consumption decisions.",
        "He/she highlighted the functioning of the exchange rate transmission channel.",
        "In this regard, he/she emphasized that the Mexican peso has appreciated significantly in real terms since the beginning of the restrictive cycle.",

        "He/she underlined that, although, in his/her opinion, there is no conclusive evidence of domestic inflationary pressures, if they were present, they would be already addressed with the restrictive level that has been attained.",
        "He/she added that, given the persistence of the core component and the environment of high uncertainty, it is crucial to remain vigilant to take the necessary actions if additional shocks were to occur.",
        "He/she stated that, after having paused the hiking cycle, Banco de México can resort to its communication as a tool to continue supporting the strength of the monetary policy stance.",

        "One member agreed that various metrics point to the consolidation of a clear and sustained convergence trajectory towards the target.",

        "However, another member noted that, although headline inflation has continued decreasing, its decline has slowed down.",
        "One member emphasized the significant contribution of the non-core component to the decline in headline inflation over the last year, as well as the equally important role of the base effects.",
        "Most members highlighted that the decline in supported by the favorable evolution of the core component.",
        "They indicated that the latter continued decreasing and registered 5.50% in said month.",

        "Most members noted the 301 basis-point decline in the core component since its highest level registered in November 2022.",
        "One member specified that, while it has decreased more gradually than headline inflation, the magnitude of its decline is only comparable to the disinflation observed between the case of headline inflation, various trend measures of core inflation also show an improvement, such as the trimmed mean, which is on a decreasing trajectory, as well as the fraction of the basket with extreme variations, which has declined markedly relative to a year ago.",

        "Another member warned that the anticipated increase in annual headline inflation for November and December could affect short-term inflation expectations.",
        "As for expectations drawn from market instruments, one member indicated that breakeven inflation rose mainly due to the increases in the inflation risk premium for different terms.",

        "Another member stated that the balance of risks has improved with respect to that observed in March.",
        "He/she partly attributed this to the greater relevance of the risk of an external slowdown that moderates external demand.",
        "He/she added that the revision of forecasts at the September policy meeting implied the materialization of the risk on core inflation’s persistence.",
        "One member argued that to continue labeling the balance of risks as biased to the upside does not mean that the environment is as adverse as it was last year.",
        "He/she pointed out that at that time the upward bias meant the possibility that inflation would increase at an even greater rate than what was being observed, while in the disinflation phase it means that inflation could decrease more gradually than what is foreseen during the forecast horizon.",
        "Among upside risks, most members highlighted core inflation’s persistence at high levels.",
        "However, one member expressed that this risk might have decreased as a result of the current lower levels of inflation.",
        "He/she stated that, based on empirical evidence, the higher the levels of inflation, the greater the probability that high levels of inflation become entrenched in the economy.",
        "Consequently, he/she argued that the reduction already shown by the core component might have eased this risk.",

        "Some members mentioned the pro-cyclical fiscal policy as a risk.",
        "One member noted that although a lower deficit than the one approved is expected for 2023, a public balance deficit of 4.9% of GDP is anticipated for 2024.",
        "He/she mentioned that, the above, together with changes in the composition of government expenditures, implies substantial challenges for the fiscal consolidation foreseen for 2025.",

        "Regarding the latter, he/she emphasized that greater weight should be given to climate-related factors in the balance of risks to inflation.",
        "Some members highlighted the risk of pressures on energy prices due to the escalation of geopolitical conflicts.",

        "He/she considered that the reference rate should remain at its current level, taking into account the revised forecasts from the September policy decision, the pressures on prices, mainly of services, and the levels of headline and core inflation that still prevail.",
        "However, he/she asserted that such levels reflect not only the road that remains to be covered, but also the significant progress in disinflation.",
        "In this regard, he/she highlighted the decrease in headline and core inflation since the third and fourth quarters of 2022, respectively, and that, looking forward, disinflation is expected to remain underway.",
        "In this context, he/she argued that the possibility of adjusting the reference rate downwards could begin to be evaluated in the policy meetings of the first quarter of 2024.",
        "He/she noted that such option would be on the table and that the decisions to be taken would be subject to available information.",

        "In this context, he/she considered that the reference rate should remain at its current level.",
        "He/she pointed out that, looking ahead, several factors may hinder the expected path of inflation and complicate the conduction of monetary policy.",
        "Among these factors, he/she highlighted a higher-than-expected growth; a pro-cyclical fiscal policy; and the possibility of fiscal pressures derived from the need to support the population affected by Hurricane Otis; all of this with a positive point estimate for the output gap and with an outlook for it narrowing further.",
        "Regarding the external front, he/she underlined the lengthening of the Federal Reserve's strategy of maintaining higher interest rates for a longer period, which could trigger new episodes of depreciation.",
        "He/she also mentioned the possibility of a prolongation or escalation of geopolitical conflicts that could affect commodity prices and the stability of financial markets.",
        "He/she reiterated that given the increase in the upward bias of the balance of risks for inflation, it is necessary to maintain the level of monetary restriction attained.",
        "He/she pointed out that the statement of this decision should maintain a cautious tone, underline the high level of uncertainty, and highlight that the upwards bias in the balance of risks for inflation has increased.",
        "He/she indicated that, although there is the possibility of adjusting the monetary policy stance in the first quarter of next year, it is subject to assumptions related to the inflationary outlook, which can change rapidly under the present adverse environment, given the risks mentioned above.",
        "He/she expressed that, for this reason, it is neither prudent nor necessary to bring forward a signal that could change soon, especially when the market has already internalized the possibility of a first cut to the reference rate between March and May of next year.",
        "He/she mentioned that a flexible and data-dependent approach should be maintained, and that such communication should be evaluated once again in the next policy decision.",
        "One member considered that, while the reference rate should remain at its current level, in the policy decisions of the first quarter of 2024 a discussion regarding the possibility of a fine-tuning of the reference rate could begin.",
        "He/she argued that such discussion could take place depending on available information suggesting that the risks that have been pointed out have not materialized, and that inflation remains on the foreseen trajectory.",
        "He/she highlighted that progress in disinflation must be acknowledged.",
        "He/she noted that, due to the reduction in 12-month inflation expectations, the ex-ante real interest rate has increased by almost 80 basis points since March.",
        "He/she argued that in the next months said rate should be maintained between inflation to the target; for this reason, the fine-tuning, in his/her opinion, would take place in order to prevent the ex-ante real rate from moving out of that interval.",
        "He/she stated that Banco de México should use more and better forward guidance, in line with the recommendations of international organizations.",
        "He/she stated that the period during which the reference rate will remain fixed should no longer be categorized as “extended”, and it should rather be indicated explicitly that it will remain unchanged at least until the end of the year.",
        "He/she expressed that it should be made clear that next year's policy decisions will be subject to the evolution of incoming data, in order for expectations about the first cut to the reference rate not to be anticipated or postponed in an unjustified manner.",
        "He/she noted that analysts estimate a first adjustment to the rate in March 2024, while, according to market instruments, this would occur between March and May.",
        "He/she pointed out that expectations should be monitored so that they do not diverge significantly as a reflection of the greater uncertainty about the next reference rate adjustment.",
        "He/she recommended communicating that, although monetary policy normalization seems distant, occasional and gradual adjustments during the first quarters of next year are not ruled out.",
        "He/she pointed out that, given the domestic pressures, when conducting monetary policy, the main objective should be the absolute policy stance.",
        "Regarding the relative stance, he/she stated that the interest rate differential between Mexico and the United States is sufficient to counter financial volatility, although he/she warned that this has started to affect the exchange rate, which could reduce the positive contribution it has had on input costs.",
        "He/she added that the lack of coordination between fiscal and monetary policies could delay the transmission of monetary policy and hinder its normalization.",
        "He/she argued that, in his/her opinion, monetary policy transmission in Mexico is less effective than in other countries, due to the low levels of financial depth and inclusion, low credit penetration, the high levels of informality, and the lack of competition in the financial system.",
        "He/she pointed out that, this same lack of competition in other sectors has allowed those firms with market power to continue increasing their prices, despite the fact that the supply shocks which drove those increases have dissipated.",
        "He/she stated that the above has slowed down the decline in inflation.",
        "Another member stated that the reference rate should still remain at its current level for some time, and that the restrictive monetary policy stance should probably be maintained throughout the forecast horizon in order to mitigate risks, consolidate the downward trend in inflation, and continue lowering its expectations.",
        "In this regard, he/she highlighted that the disinflationary process has advanced, particularly in the last twelve months, at a speed unseen since the 3% target was set, supported, in part, by the restrictive monetary policy stance.",
        "He/she added that price dynamics have started to come close to their historical pattern and that the decrease in inflation cannot be attributed to short-run factors alone, and thus, in general, the observed determinants of inflation have been more consistent with what Banco de México has foreseen.",
        "However, he/she stated that inflation expectations have decreased gradually, which could be because in Mexico the formation of inflation expectations seems to be more of a retrospective process rather than a prospective one.",
        "He/she mentioned that this is more noticeable in the behavior of business sector expectations.",
        "He/she pointed out that in economies where the formation of expectations is of a more retrospective nature, monetary tightening has a lesser effect on inflation than in economies where there are more prospective conditions.",
        "He/she considered that the monetary policy transmission channels continue operating in the right direction, although with a heterogeneous impact on economic activity and inflation, and thus they require some time to continue contributing to the disinflationary process.",
        "He/she also recalled that the balance of risks for inflation is still biased to the upside.",
        "He/she mentioned that, taking all of the above into consideration, an equilibrium must be achieved between the progress in disinflation and the existing risks within the forecast horizon.",
        "He/she argued that, given the increase in the ex-ante real interest rate and the tighter monetary conditions, which are reflected in the real exchange rate and in market instruments, it would be possible to evaluate, later on, whether the observed and anticipated disinflationary process are compatible with lower nominal interest rate levels.",
        "He/she argued that, given the environment of uncertainty surrounding decision-making, monetary policy’s approach should remain prudent, cautious and gradual, in line with the challenges that continue to be faced, in order for inflation to converge to the target, and consistent with seeking an orderly behavior of markets, the financial system, and the economy as a whole.",
        "One member mentioned that the monetary policy stance is sufficiently solid and that, along with the mitigation of inflationary shocks, it has improved the inflationary outlook.",
        "Highlighting the progress made, he/she pointed out that the ex-ante real rate is at a clearly restrictive level of around 373 basis points above the neutral range.",
        "He/she also underlined that, since March, when the rate reached its current level, headline and core inflation have, both, accumulated improvement in the inflationary outlook has been observed in its determinants; thus, the lower inflation level will signify less frequent price revisions, wages have stabilized and consumption has decelerated, while inflation expectations continue showing improvements.",
        "Furthermore, he/she stated that its balance of risks, without ignoring that it remains biased to the upside, has improved relative to March given the latest forecast revision and certain downside risks that have gained relevance, such as a possible deceleration of the global economy.",
        "However, he/she argued that challenges remain, such as the core component’s persistence, due, in part, to the behavior of services, which continue to be affected by the shocks of the pandemic and the conflict in Ukraine.",
        "He/she stated that monetary policy has been consistent with an environment characterized by a resilient economic activity and an inflation partly stemming from shocks over which monetary policy has no effect.",
        "He/she pointed out that, in this complex environment, monetary policy has prevented expectations from becoming unanchored and a contamination of the price formation process.",
        "He/she argued that, considering the improvements in the inflationary outlook and that the transmission channels are operating and will continue to have an incidence on inflation in the following quarters, there is room to discuss cuts to the reference rate.",
        "He/she mentioned that the challenge is to adjust the monetary policy stance in order to be consistent with the fact that inflation, while still above target, is already trending downwards.",
        "He/she stated that, considering the expected progress on the inflationary outlook, the first reference rate cut could occur at the beginning of the first quarter of 2024.",
        "He/she mentioned that, in a context in which the disinflationary process may not be linear, the solid monetary policy stance would continue operating even if rate adjustments are implemented.",
        "He/she added that, given the prevailing environment of uncertainty, adjustments would be gradual and not necessarily continuous.",

        "Dissenting opinion on the monetary policy Although inflation has been decreasing, its convergence to the target in the second quarter of current half of the year, the disinflationary process has slowed down.",
        "Core inflation has fallen mainly due to the decline in merchandise inflation as services inflation has shown a resistance to decline and recently it has increased.",
        "In my opinion, the upward bias in the risks to inflation has increased, with a more resilient economic activity, a cyclical position of the economy in positive territory, a tight labor market, core inflation persistence, non-core inflation trending upwards, inflation expectations above our target and not reverting, and a procyclical fiscal policy for 2024.",
        "Looking ahead, the commitment to attain fiscal consolidation starting in Under such conditions, I believe we should remain prudent and cautious in our communication and avoid modifying our forward guidance in advance, given the high level of uncertainty regarding inflation’s downward trajectory.",

        "He/she stated that the current context provides an opportunity to slow down the pace of reference rate increases and to consider the possibility of reaching the terminal rate of the current hiking cycle.",
        "He/she underlined that since the last monetary policy decision the inflation outlook improved at the margin, mainly due to lower external pressures, which is expected to lead to the materialization of a downward inflation trajectory.",
        "In this regard, he/she pointed out that different pressures on inflation justify implementing a restrictive monetary policy stance for a certain period.",
        "However, he/she sustained that it is time to focus on tackling domestic-related pressures, especially on services prices.",
        "He/she listed the factors that, in his/her opinion, will be key to determine the terminal interest rate: i) that inflation draws closer to its historical average, as in recent readings; ii) that core inflation consolidates a decreasing trend in its merchandise component and services inflation is contained; iii) that short- and medium-term expectations are more stable and gradually approach the target; iv) that the uncertainty associated with the balance of risks for inflation decreases, as it has done marginally; v) that incoming data validate the expected trajectory for inflation and that its forecast undergoes marginal revisions; and vi) that the restrictive level that has been attained is consistent with the complex nature of the current inflation phenomenon.",
        "He/she highlighted that the latter is possibly the most important factor.",
        "He/she estimated that during the upcoming monetary policy decision it will be determined whether the evolution of data allows to confirm the level of 11.25% as the terminal rate or if an additional adjustment is required.",
        "He/she stated that, once said level has been attained, during the next phase of the monetary cycle, the interest rate will need to remain fixed for a period of time enough to consolidate the convergence of inflation to the target.",
        "He/she considered that, during such phase, a restrictive monetary policy stance should be maintained with an ex-ante real interest rate of around 7%, considering that the reduction in expected inflation is reflected in increases in the exante real interest rate.",
        "He/she stated that Banco de Mexico’s communication must be as explicit as possible, avoiding an insufficiently clear forward guidance; for this reason, he/she pointed out that the monetary policy statement should justify the decision clearly, as well as the future intentions, specifying that these do not represent a fixed commitment and that they are subject to incoming data.",
        "Finally, he/she underlined that it is necessary to convey that, with the proposed adjustment, the hiking cycle would be close to ending, depending on the evolution of incoming data.",
        "Another member pointed out that headline inflation has decreased slowly and that the core component has shown greater persistence.",
        "With the proposed increase, he/she considered that the expected trajectory of inflation, as well as the associated balance of risks, are consistent with slowing the pace of interest rate increases.",
        "He/she highlighted three elements to consider for the conduct of monetary policy.",
        "First, he/she mentioned that the level of the monetary policy stance attained is historically high and that the ex-ante real interest rate is about to be almost twice the upper bound of the neutral range, which he/she estimated will be proportional to the observed inflation gap.",
        "He/she pointed out that said gap is anticipated to continue narrowing, while the ex-ante real interest rate is foreseen to increase insofar as inflation expectations ease.",
        "He/she stated that these expectations in the past have declined at a slower pace than the decrease in inflation, and that therefore it is reasonable to expect the real interest rate increase to not be excessive, although sufficient to maintain a significantly restrictive policy stance.",
        "He/she noted that, despite the recent episode of volatility, the real exchange rate continues acting restrictively on the economy, and thus overall monetary conditions have reached a level that supports the convergence of inflation.",
        "Second, he/she indicated that the monetary policy stance impacts the economy gradually.",
        "He/she reminded that the ex-ante real interest rate exceeded its range estimated as neutral six months ago, so monetary restriction can be expected to begin showing its effects more clearly during the second half of the year and reach them fully during 2024.",
        "Therefore, he/she pointed out the need to act cautiously so that the restrictive policy stance does not end up having an impact at times when the inflationary gap is not significant.",
        "Third, he/she underlined that effective central bank communication contributes to reduce some of these lags.",
        "He/she considered it relevant for communication to contribute to a better understanding of the central bank's reaction function for the rest of the year, in order to reduce market uncertainty over the interest rate’s expected trajectory, so that the latter is consistent with the central bank’s forecasts.",
        "He/she concluded that it is convenient to outline that, in the current conditions and in the absence of additional and significantly adverse shocks, the policy stance attained will allow to maintain inflation expectations anchored, will avoid second-round effects on price formation, and will be adequate for inflation to converge to the target within the forecast horizon, consistent with the constitutional mandate.",
        "One member considered a 25-basis point increase in the reference rate appropriate, given that, although core inflation remains high, inflationary pressures have shown signs of mitigation, which are anticipated to be more noticeable over the following months.",
        "Likewise, he/she indicated that the degree of policy restraint already attained must be considered.",
        "He/she pointed out that, with this adjustment, the reference rate will have accumulated a 725-basis point increase, bringing the real shortterm interest rate to a clearly restrictive level of approximately 6.5%.",
        "He/she stated that the monetary restriction has been reflected in different indicators, such as shorter-term inflation expectations, which have stabilized, and longer-term inflation expectations, which have remained anchored.",
        "He/she added that, given the tighter financial conditions, in view of the monetary tightening in Mexico and in other countries, the adjustment in the short-term real interest rate has been transmitted along the yield curve of real interest rates.",
        "Additionally, he/she highlighted the real exchange rate appreciation that has been observed since the start of the hiking cycle, and mentioned that this could be reflecting tighter monetary conditions.",
        "He/she also underlined three additional elements to consider in this monetary policy decision.",
        "First, that monetary policy operates with a lag and some of the transmission channels, such as the exchange rate and inflation expectations, act at a greater speed.",
        "He/she added that, since last September, the exante real interest rate has been above the upper limit of the neutral range, and therefore the impact of monetary tightening will be more noticeable over the next quarters.",
        "Second, he/she noted that the ex-ante real interest rate will continue increasing insofar as inflation expectations decrease.",
        "Third, he/she pointed that, in addition to the reference rate, communication also acts as a policy tool and it can continue strengthening the actions that have already been implemented.",
        "He/she concluded that the proposed policy stance will have the necessary strength for inflation to continue converging to the target.",
        "He/she indicated that monetary policy actions should prevent this convergence from being compromised and should foster an orderly adjustment of the economy and financial markets, in accordance with the constitutional mandate.",
        "He/she stated that the proposed adjustment would consolidate the monetary policy stance and provide room to evaluate the effects of the significant reference rate increase, so that, in the absence of new shocks, looking ahead it would be convenient to maintain the monetary policy stance that would be attained in this decision.",
        "The Governing Board evaluated the magnitude and diversity of the inflationary shocks and its determinants, along with the evolution of mediumand long-term inflation expectations and the price formation process.",
        "It considered the challenges stemming from the ongoing tightening of global financial conditions, the environment of uncertainty, the persistence of accumulated inflationary pressures and the possibility of greater effects on inflation, as well as the monetary policy stance already attained in this hiking cycle.",
        "Based on the above, and with the presence of all its members, the Board decided unanimously to raise the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 25 basis points to 11.25%.",
        "With this action, it slows the pace of interest rate increases and the monetary policy stance adjusts to the trajectory required for inflation to converge to its 3% target within the forecast horizon.",
        "The Board will thoroughly monitor inflationary pressures as well as all factors that have an incidence on the foreseen path for inflation and its expectations.",
        "The latter, in order to set a policy rate that is consistent at all times with both the orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to the 3% target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates as well as with an adequate adjustment of the economy and financial markets.",
        "For its upcoming decision, the Board will take into account the inflation outlook, considering the monetary policy stance already attained.",
        "Victoria Rodríguez, Galia Borja, Irene Espinosa, Jonathan Heath, and Omar Mejía voted in favor of increasing the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 25 basis points to 11.25%.",
        "Dissenting opinion on the monetary policy Communication is a fundamental pillar of monetary policy.",
        "In recent years, our central bank has introduced changes and made significant progress in this field.",
        "Nevertheless, these have been mainly implemented on a case-by-case basis, according to circumstances, and, on occasions, without previously discussed guidelines.",
        "Such is the case of forward guidance.",
        "Its purpose is to aid in the formation of expectations aligned to the long-term view of monetary policy, which is conditional on available information, to enable an orderly adjustment of financial markets.",
        "However, the forward guidance proposed in this policy statement is limited only to the upcoming decision and omits communicating that we anticipate that the monetary policy stance must remain restrictive for 2 years in order to achieve convergence to the 3% exact target.",
        "This reinforces a very short-term view, inevitably partial and incomplete, that does not fulfill the purpose of contributing to the formation of expectations for the horizon in which monetary policy operates.",
        "For this reason, I reiterate the urgent need to evaluate our communication policy."

        "Most members pointed out that the forecasts for global economic activity have been revised downwards and, for this reason, global economic activity is expected to grow at a more moderate rate.",
        "In this context, some members concorded that the balance of risks for world economic growth continues biased to the downside.",
        "Most members agreed that the main risks for global economic growth include: i) the escalation of trade disputes; ii) the tightening of global financial conditions, although this risk has declined recently; iii) several political and geopolitical factors; and, iv) the volatility of crude oil prices.",
        "Regarding the first risk, most members mentioned that the trade dispute between China and the U.S. remains as one of the main factors of concern.",
        "In this regard, one member added that, despite the recent progress made in the trade negotiations between these economies, a new stage of higher tariffs between the U.S. and China cannot be ruled out.",
        "In this sense, another member warned that global trade has decelerated significantly and that the Purchasing Managers’ Indices (PMIs) of the manufacturing sector show a clear reduction, particularly those regarding export orders.",
        "Finally, another member noted that the intensification of the above mentioned risk factor could affect global value chains and exhaust the possibilities of an early recovery of the global economy.",
        "As to political and geopolitical risks, some members explained that the persisting difficulties in some systemically important economies continue to heighten the climate of uncertainty.",
        "One member highlighted the Brexit, where not only significant delays have materialized, but also that the probability of an agreement on terms reasonable for both the United Kingdom and the European Union has diminished.",
        "Furthermore, the same member added that, although the agreement on fiscal matters reached between the government of Italy and the authorities of the European Union eliminates the possibility of sanctions and reduces uncertainty, the risk of a sustained deterioration of Italy’s public finances and macroeconomic outlook persists.",
        "In this context, one member underlined that political and geopolitical issues in the United Kingdom, Italy, France, and China, as well as idiosyncratic risks of emerging economies, will continue contributing to the environment of high uncertainty.",
        "Finally, regarding the risks related to crude oil prices, one member stressed that, in an environment of a global economic slowdown, and due to the higher production of crude oil by other producers, the behavior of oil prices in the next months is still uncertain, despite the production cuts agreed by some of the main producing countries.",
        "Most members pointed out that the divergence in the performance of the main advanced economies continues.",
        "In this regard, most members pointed out that, although in the U.S., the growth rate of economic activity moderated during the fourth quarter 2018, it continues to expand at a higher rate than the Eurozone, Japan, and the United Kingdom.",
        "In particular, one member stated that the dynamism of the U.S. economy reflects, among other factors, the procyclical fiscal stance adopted and the mature phase of the business cycle the U.S. economy is currently going through.",
        "As to the growth forecasts of advanced economies, most members agreed that these have been revised downwards.",
        "The members stated that, in the case of the U.S., the latest information from financial markets reflects the expectations of an economic deceleration and that considerable risk factors will be faced during this process.",
        "In this regard, one member highlighted that there is the perception that the aforementioned deceleration will materialize when the effects of the fiscal stimulus fade away, among other factors.",
        "Some members mentioned that, although the possibility of recession in the U.S. in the next years is still low, it has been increasing.",
        "As to emerging economies, one member mentioned that their economic growth exhibits significant differences and has weakened.",
        "The same member noted that growth forecasts for this group of countries have been revised downwards.",

        "Another member emphasized that the current levels of inflation are relatively low in historical terms.",
        "In the case of the U.S., most members pointed out that its lower economic dynamism, the recent fall in crude oil prices and the further strengthening of the U.S. dollar, have contributed to making headline and core inflations lie around the Federal Reserve’s 2% target.",
        "One member mentioned that, in contrast, in the Eurozone and Japan, core inflation remains clearly below their central banks’ targets.",
        "Another member considered that the balance of risks for global inflation remains relatively stable.",

        "One member mentioned that in these economies the prices of several financial assets are reflecting expectations of a significant moderation in the speed of monetary stimulus withdrawal.",
        "In the case of the U.S., all members stated that, as expected, the Federal Reserve raised the target range for the federal funds rate in December and anticipates that the pace of its monetary policy normalization will be more gradual in the future.",
        "All members argued that the abovementioned is due to the outlook of lower inflationary pressures and to expectations of a reduced economic dynamism.",

        "Additionally, one member mentioned that the policy of quantitative tightening will continue to be gradual, transparent, and foreseeable.",
        "In this regard, another member specified that although the U.S. Federal Reserve has followed a gradual and pre-announced monetary policy normalization process, the escalating trade tensions and the significant fiscal stimulus adopted in the mature phase of the economy’s business cycle, have made the behavior of the economy and of the outlook for inflation in that country more complex and uncertain.",
        "As for the Eurozone, one member pointed out that, although the European Central Bank announced the end of its assets purchase program, it also stated that the level of the interest rate and the size of its balance sheet may remain at their current levels for a long period.",
        "As for the central banks of emerging economies, one member noted that these have maintained a more vigilant monetary policy rhetoric with respect to inflation and emphasized their interest in preserving financial stability.",
        "Most members agreed that international financial markets exhibited high volatility and that the prices of financial assets of emerging economies have deteriorated slightly, although their evolution has improved in the last days.",
        "In this regard, some members mentioned that the greater uncertainty about economic activity, especially in the U.S., and its implications for global financial conditions, have led to adjustments in stock markets and to greater risk aversion.",
        "One member stated that this adverse international environment was also due to the combination of increased trade tensions between the U.S. and China and to the perception of a certain exhaustion of the effects of the fiscal stimulus on economic activity.",
        "The same member explained that this environment is particularly noticeable in the countries that have vulnerable macroeconomic fundamentals or are facing idiosyncratic risk factors.",

        "Additionally, some members pointed out that crude oil prices have continued to decline, which has contributed to this environment of uncertainty.",
        "One member also warned that it is important to take into account that market adjustments can be considerably abrupt in face of the events related with the deceleration of the Chinese economy, in a context where it is not foreseen that new wide-scale measures will be implemented to offset such downturn.",
        "In this regard, one member highlighted that, in this environment, the financial assets of emerging economies registered moderate losses and investors continue to reduce their exposure to fixed-income assets of these economies while they have increased their exposure to equity assets.",
        "One member noted that, recently, expectations of a more gradual monetary policy normalization process in advanced economies has eased the volatility in international financial markets and allowed for a certain recovery in the asset prices of emerging economies.",

        "As for aggregate demand, most members agreed that the negative trend of investment persists, one member highlighting the lower expenditure on construction and in machinery and domestic equipment.",
        "Another member pointed that the trajectory of investment continues to be a cause for concern and noted that gross fixed investment has been following, up to September, a downward trend starting from very low levels.",
        "The same member added that it seems unlikely that this indicator will strengthen in the short term and that although there are several determinants of investment weakness, the lack of confidence is clearly one of the most relevant, and if no decisive actions are taken to revert this situation, the recovery of investment will be significantly limited.",
        "Most members stressed that, in the opinion of economic analysts surveyed by Banco de México, the current juncture to make investments is going through difficult times.",
        "One of them warned that this scenario worsened considerably in the last survey.",
        "Another one stated that in recent months business confidence indicators have deteriorated overall, those of the manufacturing, commercial, and construction sectors reaching levels considered as pessimistic.",
        "Most members underlined the expansion of private consumption.",
        "Regarding external demand, some noted that, at the margin, the dynamism of manufacturing exports has moderated.",
        "One of them highlighted the case of automotive exports.",
        "Another member stated that, despite the downturn observed in October, manufacturing exports remain on an upward trend.",
        "As for the production side, one member added that, although the dynamism of services has prevailed, industrial activity weakened at the margin, especially manufacturing and mining, which showed a marked deterioration associated with crude oil extraction.",
        "Most members stated that forecasts for economic growth for the end of this year and for 2019 have been revised downwards by international organizations as well as by public agencies and private sector organizations.",
        "One member highlighted that the growth environment for 2019 is subject to high levels of uncertainty and will depend on the public policies that are implemented and their effects on private investment and consumption.",
        "In this context, most members expressed that the balance of risks to growth remains biased to the downside and has deteriorated.",
        "One member added that the downward bias is observed in both a short- and a medium-term horizon.",
        "In addition to the global risks described above, some members mentioned additional risks, such as: i) facing obstacles in the ratification of the trade agreements reached between Mexico, the United States and Canada; ii) that factors that lead to greater domestic uncertainty and less confidence in the outlook for the Mexican economy arise; and, iii) that certain delays arise in the execution of public expenditure related to the change of administration.",
        "Most members argued that there are considerable risk factors for the medium and long terms, indicating one member that these are even of greater concern than those for the short term.",
        "Among the risks mentioned by most members are those of a structural nature derived from the possible adoption of policies that could lead to deep changes in the economy and in growth capacity; as well as those derived from the lack of rule of law, public insecurity and impunity, which are significantly affecting the prospects for investment and economic growth.",
        "One member added that the challenges are even more complex considering that no increase in the ratio of public investment to GDP is foreseen in the coming years; that it is difficult to expect that the dynamism of consumption will continue in an environment of persistently weak investment; and that exports might be affected given the outlook of lower world trade growth.",
        "Most members considered that the slack conditions in the economy have remained relatively less tight than those observed at the beginning of the year.",
        "Some members mentioned that the phase of the business cycle that the Mexican economy is going through has not changed significantly since the last monetary policy decision.",
        "In this regard, some members indicated that most slack indicators, except those of the labor market, remain in neutral territory.",
        "One member specified that the economy operates with an output gap close to zero.",
        "Some members commented that the labor market maintains tight conditions, and one of them added that wages have increased.",
        "Some members argued that aggregate demand pressures are not perceived in the short term.",
        "One of them pointed out that this is due to the fact that some moderation in economic activity is expected in such horizon.",
        "In this regard, another member added that the output gap is still expected to continue to decrease in the following quarters, reaching levels around zero towards the end of 2019 and moderately below zero towards the end of 2020.",
        "The majority indicated that headline inflation fell from 4.90% in October to 4.72% in November, exhibiting reductions in both its core and non-core components.",
        "One member pointed out that after reaching a maximum level of 6.77% in December decreasing trend.",
        "Another member specified that from October to November headline inflation decreased for the second consecutive month, while another member warned that it is still early to conclude that the inflationary trend has resumed a downward trajectory and added that most indicators on the present juncture confirm that inflationary pressures persist.",
        "One member highlighted that, since June, headline inflation has been affected by considerable increases in non-core inflation, particularly in energy prices.",
        "As for headline inflation components, some members mentioned that non-core inflation fell from the lower increases in energy prices.",
        "They added, however, that such effects were partially offset by the higher increases in the prices of some agricultural products, so that non-core inflation remains at high levels.",
        "In this respect, some members specified that the prices of fruits and vegetables have increased significantly in recent weeks.",
        "Regarding core inflation, all members agreed that the shocks that have affected non-core inflation have also influenced core inflation due to the indirect effects they have had in production costs.",
        "The majority indicated that despite the reduction in core inflation from 3.73% in October to decline due to the aforementioned shocks and also to structural factors.",
        "One member emphasized that core inflation has decreased with noticeable sluggishness.",
        "Another member mentioned that the recent behavior of core inflation does not yet reflect a general decline in all of its components.",
        "A member noted that, after decreasing in the first half of the year, core inflation was 3.62% in June and 3.63% in November, and that it has been affected by an increase in the annual price variation of services other than housing and education.",
        "Finally, another member added that the high persistence in the merchandise and services subindex, as well as the indirect effects of the exchange rate, have also contributed to the evolution of core inflation.",
        "Most members mentioned that headline inflation expectations for different terms have increased.",
        "In particular, those for the end of 2019 increased from while those for the end of 2020 were revised upwards from 3.50% to 3.79% during the same period.",
        "The majority also indicated that during the same period, core inflation expectations for the end of 2019 were adjusted from 3.45% to 3.50%, while those for the end of 2020 increased from 3.33% to long-term headline inflation expectations are still above the permanent 3% target, at levels around expectations (up to four years) were adjusted upwards and that the dispersion of long-term expectations has increased.",
        "As for information drawn from market instruments, the majority pointed out that medium- and long-term inflationary risk premia remain at high levels.",
        "The majority of the members pointed out that inflation forecasts were revised upwards.",
        "One member stated that the indirect effects on core inflation have caused its deviation from the trajectory anticipated in the forecast.",
        "In this context, some members highlighted that the upward revision of forecasts is mainly due to a path for the exchange rate more depreciated-than-previously anticipated and to higher prices of agricultural products, particularly, fruits and vegetables.",
        "One of the members stated that the upward revision in the prices of such categories —as a result of adverse weather conditions— partially offsets the fall in energy prices.",
        "Another member added the recent increase in minimum wages to the factors affecting the projections for inflation.",
        "The majority of the members considered that the balance of risks for the expected trajectory of inflation has deteriorated and remains biased to the upside, in an environment of marked uncertainty.",
        "Some members noted that, in an adverse external environment and with significant factors of domestic uncertainty, some of the risks to the upside for inflation have materialized.",
        "One of the members highlighted that, under such an environment, the outlook for medium- and short-term inflation has become more uncertain.",
        "One member estimated that, at the margin, the stabilization in the exchange rate market as well as a slightly less unfavorable external environment have improved the outlook for inflation in the short term.",
        "However, that member also acknowledged that considerable risks for the longer term persist for inflation and that core inflation continues to show an elevated degree of uncertainty.",
        "Some members agreed that there is a high risk that the convergence of headline inflation to its 3% target is delayed.",
        "One member added that such risks increase in an environment in which survey-based expectations for headline inflation and, to a lesser extent, for core inflation, for the next two years have been adjusted upwards, even without incorporating the recent increase in minimum wages.",
        "As for the main cyclical risks to the upside for inflation, most members highlighted: the possibility that the peso exchange rate continues to be subject to pressures stemming from external and domestic factors; that additional pressures on energy prices or increases in the prices of agricultural products are observed; that a possible escalation of worldwide protectionist or retaliatory measures materializes; and, that public finances deteriorate.",
        "The majority also mentioned that considering the magnitude of the recent minimum wage increases, in addition to their possible direct impact, there is the risk that these bring about wage revisions that exceed productivity gains and create cost pressures, affecting formal employment and prices.",
        "Some members mentioned that due to the observed shocks and the levels reached by inflation, there is the risk of second-round effects on the price formation process.",
        "Most members pointed out that inflation also faces structural risks related to the possible adoption of policies that could lead to significant changes in the economy’s price formation process.",
        "In this respect, some members noted that a structural weakening of public finances could be observed, and one member added that, in his/her opinion, this is one of the main risks for inflation.",
        "Another member mentioned the possibility that the economy registers a lower potential growth rate.",
        "All members highlighted that since the last monetary policy decision, the prices of financial assets in Mexico continued to exhibit marked volatility.",
        "Most members coincided that in addition to the aforementioned external factors, such environment continued to reflect the uncertainty regarding the policies of the new administration, one of them stating that in his/her opinion, this latter factor has been the most relevant.",
        "Most members underscored the following as factors that have led to an environment of uncertainty: the intention to cancel the project of the New Mexico City International Airport, concerns about the business model of Mexico’s state-owned oil company legislative proposals.",
        "The majority pointed out that in such environment, the exchange rate has been under pressure, although some members mentioned that the operating conditions of the foreign exchange market remain adequate, while one of them added that the foreign exchange market has maintained stable levels of liquidity, depth and volume.",
        "Most members indicated that interest rates, mainly medium and long term, as well as sovereign risk premia remain at high levels.",
        "They also pointed out that medium- and long-term interest rates reached their highest levels in the last ten years and that operating conditions in that market have deteriorated significantly.",
        "In this regard, one member argued that primary auctions have exhibited lower participation from investors, both domestic and foreign, especially for instruments with longer terms and duration.",
        "Another member highlighted that interest rate differentials with respect to those of the United States are also at high levels.",
        "Some members added that stock indexes fell as well, and one of them emphasized that the Mexican Stock Exchange is currently at levels not observed since 2014.",
        "The majority stated that, despite the volatility observed in domestic financial markets, in the last days these have had a better performance, with a moderate reversion in the depreciation of the Mexican peso, and a reduction of both medium- and long-term interest rates, and of sovereign risk premia.",
        "One member elaborated along the same lines that long-term interest rates have fallen by more than 50 basis points and that, as a result, the yield curve steepening that had been observed has significantly reverted.",
        "The majority argued that this improvement was caused by the favorable response of markets to the submittal of the 2019 Economic Package by the Ministry of Finance (SHCP, for its acronym in Spanish) to Congress, as well as to external factors, particularly expectations of fewer increases in the federal funds rate by the U.S. Federal Reserve.",
        "Most members considered that both the domestic and external environment as described before imply medium-and long-term risks that could affect the country’s macroeconomic conditions and thus, it is particularly important that, in addition to continuing with a prudent and sound monetary policy, measures to foster an environment of confidence and certainty for investment are adopted, public finances are consolidated sustainably, and actions that lead to higher levels of productivity are implemented.",
        "One member argued that all this has become necessary not only to promote greater economic growth and development, but also to avoid the materialization of risk factors that could lead to capital outflows.",
        "As some of the measures to improve investor confidence, most members mentioned the need to offer greater clarity on Pemex's business model and, in general terms, on the energy policy to be implemented in the coming years.",
        "In this regard, one member stressed that there are strong concerns about the future of Pemex and the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE, for its acronym in Spanish), while another member argued that obtaining a higher confidence could require additional efforts in different fronts and would also take a long time.",
        "As for public finance consolidation, most members stressed that the 2019 Economic Package submitted by the Ministry of Finance strengthening required in this matter and that it was prepared considering a macroeconomic scenario based on realistic assumptions.",
        "Most members argued that, as part of the measures to strengthen the country’s macroeconomic fundamentals, it is particularly relevant that the fiscal targets included in the Economic Package are met.",
        "Some members considered the strict implementation of the fiscal targets a challenge, given the ambitious nature of the new projects by the Federal Government and the uncertainty inherent to the macroeconomic assumptions used.",
        "One member stated that this challenge is the most far-reaching one for public finances in 2019 given the deterioration of confidence.",
        "Among the risks to which the assumptions for 2019 are subject, most members pointed out the possibility that lower tax rates at Mexico’s northern border cause a higher-thanexpected reduction in tax collection; that the economy grows at a rate lower than the 2% considered in the budget as a result, for example, of a lower-than-expected global growth; and that the oil production platform turns out to be below that considered in the Federal Income Law.",
        "As additional risks, one of the members mentioned greater cuts in public spending, which typically occur at the beginning of a new administration as a result of the departure of experienced public service officials due to the austerity measures, and that a sovereign credit rating revision takes place, hence leading to a higher financial cost for public debt.",
        "With regards to the measures aimed at strengthening productivity and potential growth, some members highlighted the need to reduce the country’s insecurity levels, corruption and the weak rule of law.",
        "One of them noted that doubts prevail as to the effectiveness of the fight against corruption and the improvement in public security.",
        "The same member stated that economic analysts surveyed by Banco de México continue mentioning these two obstacles and, in general terms, the lack of rule of law, as significant drags on growth and investment.",
        "Some members pointed out that, in addition to the aforementioned, the low effectiveness of the policies to promote economic competition have also hindered the country’s potential growth and have been a source of inflationary inertia.",
        "In the same line, some members considered that the federal government policies may generate market distortions and affect the efficiency in allocating resources in the economy and, therefore, productivity.",
        "One member pointed out that it will be necessary to assure that the government actions, the multiannual projects considered and the assumptions used mainly on the estimates for economic growth and oil production, are consistent with the soundness of public finances in the medium and long terms.",
        "Some members warned that the Economic Package does not improve the composition of public spending and that the new strategy of the government seems to privilege consumption rather than human and physical capital formation, which could also affect the economy’s potential growth.",
        "They also mentioned that, in the new budget, the ratio of public investment to GDP does not increase and that public investment will be allocated to projects whose financial and social returns are not evident.",
        "One of them added that the new social programs do not seem to include a clear structure of intertemporal incentives oriented to improve productivity and efficiency, which could imply a significant cost for the population’s welfare.",
        "Another member stated that the combination of investment stagnation and consumption strengthening might have major implications for both economic growth and the conduct of monetary policy.",
        "One member highlighted that the new government still needs to reveal its new strategies regarding key sectors for development, such as education and energy, in which there were already in place processes for the implementation of reforms with medium- and longterm reach and maturity.",
        "The same member mentioned that, in the future, it will be key for both fiscal and monetary authorities to keep an open and direct communication in order to identify any possible deterioration of macroeconomic fundamentals on time and for each to act rapidly and prudently in their spheres of competence.",
        "One member delved into the factors to be considered in the conduct of monetary policy, highlighting that since mid-2015 the economy has been facing an adverse shock to its potential growth, together with a tighter external financing constraint.",
        "In this context, the same member mentioned that in recent years, the reduction in the current account deficit from around 2.5% of GDP in orderly manner, with a cost on growth of slightly over one percentage point, from 3.29% in 2015 to same member stated that in the presence of these shocks, the fiscal policy stance tightened, and therefore public sector borrowing requirements decreased by approximately three percentage points of GDP between 2015 and 2018, from 4% in that, in turn, monetary policy responded by tightening significantly its stance, in order to prevent inflation expectations in the long term from unanchoring and to restrain the decompression of the term premium, raising the target rate from 3% to its current level of 8.25%.",
        "The same member pointed out that due to the referred shocks, both the real exchange rate and real interest rates exhibited adjustments.",
        "The relative magnitude of the adjustment in the real exchange rate and real interest rates depends on the relative magnitude of the adjustment between the fiscal and monetary policies.",
        "To the extent that fiscal policy undergoes a higher adjustment, a larger part of the adjustment is reflected on the real exchange rate, whereas if monetary policy undergoes a higher adjustment, a larger part is reflected on real interest rates.",
        "The same member noted that the strong inertia exhibited by both core and fundamental core inflation.",
        "This member noted that it has been driven by null productivity growth, which makes it difficult for the economy to absorb supply shocks without having a high cost in terms of inflation.",
        "Such member added that there are other distortions that make inflation show a high persistence, such as the high market power prevailing in certain sectors of the economy, which makes core inflation exhibit a high resistance to decline.",
        "Moreover, the same member highlighted that under such market distortions, monetary policy is not an effective instrument in bringing down inflation.",
        "Such member mentioned that a case that illustrates the aforementioned is having real wages growing above productivity, which could lead to higher levels of inflation, putting at risk the goal of raising the purchasing power of earnings.",
        "This member argued that implementing a decisive policy to promote competition in some sectors of the economy should contribute to reduce the relative prices of goods and services with low levels of competition, and in turn prompt an increase in wages’ purchasing power, without creating risks or putting pressure on inflation.",
        "Such member highlighted that this situation is particularly relevant in the case of the consumption baskets of those segments of the population with the lowest incomes, given that it is possible that nearly 50% of the goods and services that make up their consumption baskets come from sectors with a high degree of market concentration.",
        "The same member warned that the fact that minimum wages have been below extreme poverty levels makes it more urgent to create an effective policy to promote competition.",
        "Such member highlighted that other factors that might be contributing to inflation’s strong persistence are public policies related to price determination of energy products and hysteresis in the economy’s price formation process.",
        "Also, that there are several distortions in the economy which might be playing a role on the high degree of inertia exhibited by core inflation and that, in some cases, monetary policy is and must continue to be the main instrument to fight inflation, while, in other, it can turn out to be a less effective instrument, depending on the distortions that are generating inflation’s persistence.",
        "All members agreed that monetary policy continues facing a complex situation, characterized by a high degree of uncertainty in which the balance of risks for inflation remains biased to the upside, in which some of the foreseen inflationary risks from a shortand medium-term perspective have materialized, and in which there is a possibility of medium- and long-term inflation expectations being affected.",
        "Most members stated that among the factors to consider for the monetary policy decision are: that non-core inflation remains high, affecting headline inflation and putting pressure on core inflation; that core inflation has shown a resistance to decline; that short-term inflation expectations have been adjusted upwards; and, that inflation risk premia has reached high levels.",
        "One member added that the aforementioned takes place together with an outlook of a negative output gap and a balance of risks to growth tilted to the downside.",
        "Some members warned about core inflation deviating from the forecasted trajectory and continuing to exhibit a high degree of uncertainty, which constitutes a risk for monetary policy.",
        "In this regard, most members agreed that the central bank must strengthen its monetary policy stance consistent with the attainment of the inflation target in the expected time frame and mitigate the risk of an un-anchoring of inflation expectations.",
        "Another member highlighted that the convergence to the inflation target during 2020 might require further increases in the reference rate.",
        "Nevertheless, such member stated that in order to define the above, it will be necessary to assess thoroughly the latest information on the outlook for inflation and its determinants, including the domestic and external factors of uncertainty that might affect inflation, in order to attain the abovementioned convergence at the lowest possible cost for economic activity.",
        "Another member emphasized that considering the U.S. Federal Reserve’s recent increase in the target for the federal funds rate, as well as the uncertainty surrounding the development of the Mexican economy and the volatility that domestic financial markets have exhibited, the short-term interest rate differentials can help the Mexican economy to transit through an environment of higher uncertainty in an orderly manner and keeping inflation expectations anchored.",
        "Most members highlighted that given the current environment, the monetary policy stance must remain prudent in the next months.",
        "One member mentioned that despite expectations of an economic slowdown in Mexico, prudence in the conduct of monetary policy is necessary given the shocks that have affected inflation, the possible persistence of an environment of uncertainty, and expectations of a continuing process of monetary policy normalization in the U.S.",
        "In this regard, the same member added that it is important to keep in mind that a deterioration of confidence in the central bank would imply higher costs in terms of both inflation and economic growth.",
        "Also, that maintaining credibility on the inflation target is necessary and, for this reason, Banco de México must focus on such target but always analyzing the implications for economic activity, which requires a balanced approach.",
        "Another member considered relevant that the monetary policy statement should include that under the present environment of high uncertainty, the Governing Board must remain vigilant to the development of inflation, its determinants and its expectations and, if necessary, act once more in a timely manner to reinforce its commitment with price stability.",
        "The same member mentioned that with these actions the central bank contributes to the attainment of the economic development goals and to improve the population’s welfare.",
        "One member added that it is important to present a forward guidance of monetary policy that communicates that given the inertia exhibited by core inflation and the prevailing uncertainty, the target rate will probably need to be kept high for a long period.",
        "To guide its monetary policy actions, Banco de México’s Governing Board follows closely the development of inflation vis-à-vis its forecasted trajectory, taking into account the monetary policy stance adopted and the time frame in which monetary policy operates, as well as available information on all inflation determinants and on medium- and long-term inflation expectations, including the balance of risks for such factors.",
        "Monetary policy must also respond prudently if for any reason the uncertainty faced by the Mexican economy increases significantly.",
        "In this context, considering the environment of high uncertainty, in which the balance of risks for inflation is biased to the upside and some of the risks that might affect it in both the short and long terms have materialized, and in view of the possibility that medium- and longterm inflation expectations may be affected, Banco de México’s Governing Board has decided unanimously to raise the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 25 basis points to 8.25%.",
        "Considering the challenges to consolidate a low and stable inflation, as well as the risks that the economy’s price formation process is subject to, the Governing Board will take the necessary actions, specifically, maintaining or, in its case, strengthening the monetary policy stance, so that the reference rate is kept at a level consistent with the convergence of headline inflation to Banco de México’s target within the period of influence of monetary policy.",
        "Banco de México’s Governing Board will maintain a prudent monetary policy stance and, under the current environment of uncertainty, will follow closely the potential pass-through of exchange rate fluctuations to prices, the monetary policy stance relative to that of the U.S. under an adverse external environment, and the conditions of slack in the Mexican economy.",
        "In the presence and possible persistence of factors that, by their nature, involve risks to both inflation and inflation expectations, monetary policy will be adjusted in a timely and robust manner to achieve the convergence of inflation to its 3% target and to strengthen the anchoring of medium- and long-term inflation expectations so that they attain such target.",
        "Alejandro Díaz de León-Carrillo, Irene EspinosaCantellano, Manuel Ramos-Francia and Javier Eduardo Guzmán-Calafell voted unanimously in favor of raising the target for the overnight interbank rate (target rate) by 25 basis points, to 8.25%.",
        "All members highlighted that available information suggests that during the second quarter of 2019 the world economy decelerated as a reflection of moderation of growth in some of the main advanced and emerging economies.",
        "Most members stated that this performance was caused by a more adverse environment for world trade, with periods of significant tension and tariff threats.",
        "Some members stressed that indicators related to international trade and the manufacturing sector point to such weakness.",
        "Some members noted that business confidence and investment have been affected by this environment to a larger degree.",
        "With respect to growth expectations, most noted that these have declined again for 2019 and 2020.",
        "One member added that projections corresponding to international trade point to the lowest dynamism of cross-border flows of goods and services since the global financial crisis.",
        "Most members indicated that the balance of risks for global growth remains biased to the downside.",
        "They stated that among the major risks those that stand out are: i) a further escalation of trade tensions between the U.S. and its main trade partners; ii) that the weakness of some of the main economies lasts longer than anticipated; iii) that new episodes of international financial volatility occur; and, iv) that some political and geopolitical risks intensify.",
        "Regarding the latter, one member stated that such risks could affect the market for energy goods and global financial stability.",
        "He/she added that an additional risk factor is the historically high level of corporate and public sector leverage in many countries, which, he/she considered leaves little room for maneuver for fiscal policy to serve as a buffer in the event of a greater deceleration or a recession.",
        "Finally, he/she underlined that all of the above could bring about systemic financial vulnerabilities.",
        "As for economic activity in advanced economies, most members argued that growth during the second quarter of the year suggests a new deceleration.",
        "One member stressed the case of the euro area, which displays clear signs of weakness both in business confidence indicators and in those associated with manufacturing activity.",
        "In the case of the U.S., he/she pointed out that both residential and nonresidential investment show an incipient weakness, while exports have started to slow down.",
        "In this context, another member mentioned that, although the yield curve of Treasury bonds has inverted in certain tranches, the lower risk premium suggests that such performance points more to a deceleration than to a recession, although all members pointed out that the US economy is expected to undergo a gradual deceleration while most of them indicated that the risk of US recession has increased.",
        "Most members stated that although job creation has slightly decreased in advanced economies, unemployment rates remain at low levels and wages continue recovering gradually.",
        "One member mentioned that unemployment gaps have remained at historic lows.",
        "In this respect, he/she stated that services, which are more labor intensive and less associated with trade activity, have continued to exhibit a better performance, supporting consumption and employment.",
        "Most members mentioned that latest information suggests a deceleration in different emerging economies.",
        "One member argued that in the current environment, emerging economies that are more open to world trade face significant challenges to boost investment.",
        "He/she explained that idiosyncratic risk factors have increased uncertainty regarding these economies’ growth outlook and that in some of them, such as Mexico’s, they have hindered investment.",
        "Another member warned that the materialization of events of variable but high likelihood, such as the referred global risks, would have severe repercussions for emerging economies, beyond the financial volatility that would be generated.",
        "He/she added that regarding economic activity, recent World Bank estimates show that a simultaneous one percentage point deceleration in the growth of the U.S., the euro area and China would generate a negative impact of 1.4 percentage points on growth of emerging economies in the first year alone, followed by a further fall of approximately one percentage point during the second year.",
        "Another member delved into downward risks to emerging economies’ growth, highlighting the possibility of a greater deceleration of the Chinese economy and of a recomposition of world trade.",
        "In this regard, he/she argued that lower bilateral deficits of the major economies could reduce trade opportunities of other economies and break the links of global value chains.",
        "All members stressed that global inflationary pressures are biased to the downside.",
        "Some of them agreed that lower commodity prices, especially those of energy products, have contributed to the above.",
        "One member claimed that, despite the risk of additional increases in oil prices as a result of geopolitical tensions and/or agreements regarding supply among the main producing countries, downward pressures on inflation could intensify over the next months, which is a cause of concern for some of the main advanced economies.",
        "Delving into the case of such economies, most members emphasized that headline and core inflation are below their central bank’s targets, and that this has taken place despite the solid performance of their labor markets and the increase, albeit contained, of wages.",
        "Some added that the economic weakness is expected to contribute to maintain inflation at low levels.",
        "One of them elaborated on the different factors that have kept inflation structurally low in advanced economies.",
        "In this regard, he/she highlighted technological change and the integration of regions with abundant labor force into globalization, which have allowed for the fragmentation of productive processes according to comparative advantages and to the cost structure of different countries and regions.",
        "He/she stressed that this has led to productivity gains and more competitive markets, which has made it more difficult for companies to raise their prices.",
        "In this context, he/she stated that marked differences have been observed between the inflation of goods and that of services.",
        "He/she pointed out that the future behavior of inflation in these economies will largely depend on the permanence or the weakening of such factors.",
        "Finally, he/she mentioned that expectations of inflation remaining at low levels and without considerable pressures in these economies prevail, although this scenario is subject to risks.",
        "All members pointed out that, given the lesser inflationary pressures and the deceleration of the global economy, expectations that the central banks of the main economies will maintain more accommodative monetary policies have strengthened.",
        "In this regard, one member highlighted that in several countries like Australia, Chile, India and Russia, policy rates have already been cut, given the improved outlook in the balance of risks for inflation, in what appears to be the beginning of a new cycle of rate cuts at the global level.",
        "Most members mentioned that the recent communications of the European Central Bank point to a greater monetary policy easing.",
        "Some members pointed out that it has shown willingness to use all its available tools to support economic activity and to ensure that inflation converges to its target.",
        "In addition to the above, one of them stressed that both the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England reaffirmed their commitment to take the necessary actions to reach their targets.",
        "As for the US Federal Reserve, most members stated that in its June meeting the target range for the federal funds rate was left unchanged.",
        "They stressed the change in the tone of the monetary policy statement towards greater easing, as well as the commitment to adopt the appropriate measures to sustain the economic expansion in view of the increased uncertainty faced by the US economy.",
        "They added that the projections for the federal funds rate of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) declined for the end of this year and the following.",
        "Most members agreed that the future trajectory of the federal funds rate implied by financial instruments shows a decrease of over 100 basis points accumulated for the end of 2020, and some of them specified that a reduction of at least 25 basis points is anticipated for July’s meeting.",
        "Some members stressed that the more adverse environment for world trade which has prevailed since the beginning of May, had a negative effect on international financial markets, in particular, on riskier assets.",
        "However, most members argued that, recently, expectations of a more accommodative monetary policy stance by the central banks of major advanced economies has contributed to a decline in interest rates throughout the entire yield curve, both in advanced and emerging economies, as well as to an increase in risk appetite.",
        "In this respect, some members mentioned the increase in stock market indices, mainly in advanced economies, as well as the strengthening of emerging economies’ currencies.",
        "In this context, they emphasized that global financial conditions have eased.",
        "One of them specified that portfolio flows to emerging economies have resumed and that sovereign borrowing costs in these economies have declined.",
        "Nevertheless, some members noted that, given the idiosyncratic deterioration in some emerging economies and the lower commodity prices, it is possible that capital flows to such economies will not be of the same magnitude as observed in other episodes of increasing risk appetite.",
        "One member mentioned that some segments of these markets continue registering outflows and therefore similar patterns of behavior for longer periods or more generalized, cannot be ruled out.",
        "Among the risk factors for international financial markets, some members highlighted those previously mentioned with regard to the global economy.",
        "One member added the possibility of an intensification of tensions related to investment and technological development as well as a greater slowdown of the Chinese economy.",
        "Another member considered that risks to international financial markets have decreased.",
        "All members underlined that available information suggests that economic activity in Mexico exhibits a greater-than-anticipated deceleration, with a contraction in the first quarter of 2019 and signs of weakness in the second quarter.",
        "One member added that there is no evidence of a rebound in economic activity, as was anticipated after it was affected by transitory factors in early 2019.",
        "Some members specified that an environment of weakness persists in most components of aggregate demand, mainly domestic demand.",
        "One of them added that all components exhibited negative variations during the last quarter of 2018, and that similar dynamics are observed for the first quarter of 2019.",
        "Delving into domestic demand, most members highlighted the slowdown of consumption and the lack of vigor of investment.",
        "One member stated that households’ consumption exhibits signs of weakness after having contributed strongly to growth during previous periods, while public spending exhibits negative growth rates.",
        "He/she specified that although in the first quarter of 2019 gross fixed investment registered a positive growth rate, this was due to an unusual increase in January, a trend that did not continue during the subsequent months.",
        "In this respect, some members added that timely information points to a continuing negative trend in investment, mainly associated to the uncertainty derived from domestic and external factors.",
        "As for external demand, some members mentioned that, despite the deceleration of global trade, manufacturing exports have strengthened throughout 2019.",
        "From a longer-term perspective, one member highlighted the secular slowdown in private consumption that has been observed since 2016 as well as the stagnation of private investment during the same period.",
        "He/she indicated that nowadays investment is even lower than that registered during for households and firms has increased constantly since 2016, and that the growth rate of commercial banks’ credit has declined since then.",
        "In his/her opinion, the transmission mechanism of the tight monetary policy is operating through channels that affect real variables.",
        "On the supply side, most members pointed out that available information suggests that economic activity registered a marginal monthly increase in April in seasonally adjusted terms, below market expectations.",
        "Some members highlighted that the Global Economic Activity Indicator (IGAE, for its acronym in Spanish) shows signs of weakness in all of its components.",
        "Most members emphasized the slowdown of the services sector, and some members highlighted that a significant unfavorable change in the trend of this sector can already be observed, after having peaked at the end of last year.",
        "One of them stated that the latter is worrisome, not only due to the importance of this sector in GDP, but also because for a long time services seemed to have been isolated from the fluctuations in the rest of the economy and were an important growth driver.",
        "Most members pointed out that, given the recent evolution of economic activity in Mexico, the growth outlook has continued to deteriorate.",
        "One member specified that downward adjustments have been due to a weaker international environment as well as to domestic factors.",
        "He/she added that the economy’s weakness is expected to persist, that investment is estimated to continue showing lack of vigor, and that consumption is anticipated to continue loosing dynamism.",
        "Another member added that growth expectations among business analysts surveyed by Banco de México have declined and reached 1.35% in May and noted that these figures did not include IGAE’s latest data yet and, therefore, they can be expected to continue adjusting to the downside.",
        "He/she also mentioned that some private analysts are already forecasting a growth rate as low as 0.5%.",
        "In this context, most members noted that during 2019 growth could be lower than expected.",
        "One member pointed out that, in his/her opinion, growth could lay around the lower bound of the range estimated in the latest Quarterly Report, and then exhibit some improvement in 2020, although he/she emphasized that this outlook should be considered with caution, due to the limited information published so far.",
        "Another member stated that the growth rates of the last two quarters and the results of the Coincident and Leading Composite Indicators System (SICCA, for its acronym in Spanish) already suggest the possibility of a mild recession.",
        "In this sense, the same member noted that for 2019 Mexico is expected to grow at a rate lower than that observed during the last ten years and below that forecasted for most emerging economies.",
        "One member considered that the economic outlook for 2019 continues to include high uncertainty due to both domestic and external factors.",
        "Most members pointed out that the balance of risks to growth had expanded its downward bias as a result of both external and domestic factors, and some members mentioned that the balance of risks has become more uncertain.",
        "Among external factors, in addition to the already described global risks, they added: i) the possibility that there are difficulties in the ratification of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) by the legislative bodies of the U.S. and Canada; and, ii) that there are new threats of tariffs on Mexican imports by the U.S.",
        "In this regard, one member underlined that, although the negotiations between the governments of these two countries led to the indefinite suspension of tariffs, such agreement is a temporary solution and will be revised in mid-July, and the way in which the results of Mexico’s commitments will be measured is not clear.",
        "He/she stressed that the mere perception of the U.S. authorities that Mexico is not fulfilling its commitments, as well as the electoral cycle in the U.S., could prolong the threat of the imposition of tariffs.",
        "He/she emphasized that the ratification of the USMCA in the U.S. and Canada could become more complex, and that, even if the agreement is ratified by the congresses of the three countries, the continuous threat of tariffs by the U.S. towards Mexico could hinder the implementation of the new trade agreement.",
        "Among domestic risks, some members mentioned the possibility of additional reductions to the sovereign credit rating and to that of Pemex’s.",
        "One member pointed out that a similar situation could occur with the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE, for its acronym in Spanish), whose credit rating and outlook were also revised downwards by an agency, although its debt continues maintaining investment grade.",
        "Another member mentioned the risk of a greater decrease in public revenues.",
        "Finally, one member pointed out the direction taken by public policies in different areas.",
        "These elements are addressed in detail further in this document.",
        "Most members mentioned that slack conditions in the economy have loosened even more than expected.",
        "In this regard, some noted that the risk of economic slack widening in the next quarters persists.",
        "One member mentioned that, despite the economic weakening, different indicators point to relatively high wage pressures.",
        "He/she added that the combination of weak economic activity and wage pressures has affected the evolution of employment.",
        "He/she noted that a broad range of labor market indicators, such as the unemployment rate, the share of employed population that became unemployed, or the withdrawals from individual AFORE accounts due to unemployment, show the greater lassitude exhibited by this market.",
        "Some members mentioned that the labor market shows a lower rate of job creation.",
        "One member pointed out that informal sector employment has increased and formal employment has contracted.",
        "He/she specified that across different regions of Mexico, the weakening of employment is more evident in the Northern border free zone, where the larger wage adjustments have been observed, and that the lessons derived from this experience should be taken into consideration.",
        "Most members mentioned that between April and the first fortnight of June 2019, headline inflation decreased from 4.41 to 4.00%.",
        "One member highlighted that this indicator lay at the upper limit of the variability interval around the target.",
        "All members indicated that the decline of headline inflation was due to a significant decrease of the non-core component.",
        "In turn, most members pointed out that core inflation remains at high levels.",
        "One member pointed out that headline inflation has shown a clear downward trend since September, when it was at and in April due to calendar factors.",
        "He/she stressed that the recent evolution of inflation has been better than anticipated, and that the figure of the first fortnight of June turned out to be far below the forecast in the Quarterly Report published in May.",
        "He/she added that observed inflation has been considerably below the expectations at the end of up to May 2019 to be 0.68%, while it was only 0.21%.",
        "In this context, another member stated that cumulative headline inflation for the first five months of 2019 was the third lowest for a similar period since Banco de México adopted the current inflation targeting regime, and that with June’s figure, which again surprised on the downside, the cumulative rate of the first half of the year points to be the second lowest after the historically low figure registered in fact that cumulative non-core inflation of the last five months is the lowest for this statistic since the measurements of core and non-core inflation have been on record, and that the random and volatile nature of non-core inflation should be stressed, given that cumulative core inflation during the same period was 1.60%, the fourth highest in the last 20 years.",
        "One member pointed out that although the decline in headline inflation has been fundamentally due to non-core inflation developments, it is possible to anticipate that over the next months core inflation will also begin to decrease.",
        "As to the performance of the non-core and core components, all members highlighted that the former has been following a downward trend and the majority indicated that it decreased from 6.08 to also highlighted that such reduction was mainly the result of the lower increases in energy products, which were partly due to the fall in their international references.",
        "Some members also added the lower increases observed in the prices of fruits and vegetables.",
        "As for core inflation, most members pointed out that it was 3.87% both in April and June the upside in June.",
        "Most members mentioned that core inflation has been affected by the indirect effects of pressures on energy prices and that, within it, the higher rates of change of food merchandise and services prices are noteworthy.",
        "Some members stated that core inflation’s resistance to decline is worrisome, since a greater economic slack should lead to lower pressures on this component.",
        "One member argued that core inflation’s persistence may be partly due to the fact that both the labor gap and wage pressures have offset the effects that a negative output gap and slack conditions may have otherwise had.",
        "Another member underlined that this subindex, in addition to remaining at high levels, has registered new increases in recent months.",
        "Such member noted that this performance is not explained by the behavior of some of the items within it but rather by widespread pressures on core inflation, as shown by trimmed mean indicators, the median of the rates of change, and the re-weighted estimates which smooth the influence of extreme variations.",
        "He/she pointed out that, in the case of services, significant increases in education and figures close to 6% in services other than housing and education, excluding tourist and telecommunication services, as well as an upward trend in the prices of housingrelated services, although still below 3%, are observed.",
        "He/she added that, due to their nature, the factors that explain these trends probably stem from the shocks on food merchandise and energy prices as well as the wage adjustments that took place in previous months.",
        "Another member stated that, to understand the latest inflation dynamics, it is useful to consider an indicator such as the six-month moving average of the seasonally adjusted annualized monthly rate of change, as it does not carry forward the performance of inflation from relatively distant periods and is not affected by problems related to the base of comparison.",
        "The same member noted that, according to such indicator, core inflation displays a clear downward trend, laying at around 3.5%, while headline inflation is close to 3.1%.",
        "Most members mentioned that, between early May and mid-June, short-, medium- and long-term headline inflation expectations did not register significant adjustments.",
        "Some members pointed out that, in the same period, core inflation expectations for 2019 and 2020 increased slightly.",
        "The majority highlighted that, for all terms, expectations remained above the 3% target.",
        "One member emphasized that they are also above Banco de México’s forecasts.",
        "Another member emphasized that although observed inflation from December to May has been significantly below inflation expectations registered at the end of 2018, headline and core inflation expectations for the end of 2019 have been adjusting upwards.",
        "The same member added that these upward adjustments are surprising given that between December and May, observed inflation was below expectations and several inflation risk factors for inflation have mitigated in relation to their levels of December of last year.",
        "As to information drawn from market instruments, most members mentioned that medium- and long-term breakeven inflation expectations remain at high levels.",
        "In this regard, one member warned that the latter suggests the perception of high risks for inflation in the long run.",
        "Nevertheless, another member pointed out that such premium decreased slightly at the margin.",
        "The majority of members pointed out that both headline and core inflation are expected to follow a downward trend in the following months.",
        "Some members stated that headline inflation may improve slightly, mainly due to lower pressures on non-core inflation.",
        "Another member noted that average annual headline inflation figures for the second quarter of Reports published this year.",
        "He/she mentioned that if the monthly rates continue exhibiting a relatively favorable performance, the annual rates of change of headline inflation and core inflation may eventually converge to lower levels, once the effects related to the base of comparison fade.",
        "Delving into the outlook for core inflation, some members noted that it should begin to decline, partly due to the lower indirect effects of energy prices, as well as to the weakness of the economy.",
        "In this context, they pointed out that headline inflation is still expected to attain the target towards mid-2020.",
        "One member considered that it is feasible to attain the 3% target in the first half of 2020 and a figure below 3.5% towards the end of 2019.",
        "Another member pointed out that core inflation should begin to decrease once the temporary indirect effects on food prices that resulted from increases in energy products during the second half of 2018 begin to dissipate.",
        "These effects were due to the confluence of supply shocks in energy and food products, which will eventually end up fading.",
        "As for inflation risks, most members pointed out that some have diminished and others have gained relevance.",
        "Among risks to the upside for headline inflation, most members highlighted the possibility that the peso exchange rate comes under pressure stemming from external or domestic factors.",
        "In this regard, one member considered that it is unclear how relevant the risk of a greater exchange rate depreciation passing through on prices is, since the pass-through coefficient is either extremely low or very close to zero.",
        "He/she stated that the passthrough is practically insignificant for economies with inflation targeting regimes, central bank independence from the fiscal authority, and with flexible exchange rates.",
        "Nevertheless, he/she acknowledged that this risk cannot be entirely ruled out since the pass-through is not static and may have an unexpected non-linear behavior.",
        "In this regard, another member highlighted the risk of exchange rate pressures due to Pemex’s loss of investment grade by a second rating agency and that such risk has increased due to the lack of a credible business plan for Pemex.",
        "The majority stated as an additional upward risk the threat of the United States imposing tariffs on Mexican imports and the adoption of compensatory measures, although this risk has decreased as a result of the recent agreement.",
        "One member also included the risk associated to the USMCA ratification.",
        "Some members mentioned the possibility of protectionist measures escalating worldwide and that core inflation’s persistence leading to a greater resistance to decline of mediumand long-term inflation expectations.",
        "Most members also underlined the risk that public finances deteriorate.",
        "The majority of members highlighted the risk that, given the magnitude of several wage revisions, costrelated pressures arise, insofar as such revisions exceed productivity gains.",
        "One member highlighted that the above may affect formal employment and put pressure, particularly on core inflation.",
        "Another member noted his/her concern that such cost pressures are being observed in the overall economy and, especially, in the manufacturing sector.",
        "He/she added that such pressures may intensify at the beginning of 2020 if minimum wages are adjusted above productivity gains.",
        "One member underlined that a lower-than-expected capacity of the economy to absorb labor cost increases, may put pressure on the most labor-intensive sectors, as is the case of several of the service sectors.",
        "He/she mentioned as additional risks that the indirect effects of energy prices and of the IMSS-insured workers’ wage materialize into higher pressures on housing prices and those of other services, as well as the possibility of greater increases in food merchandise prices due to increases in international prices.",
        "Another member added that, despite the greater economic slack, core inflation’s resistance to decline may continue, just as has been the case in the last quarters, in which despite economic activity having weakened more than expected, core inflation has continued to show resistance to decline and has even increased at the margin.",
        "As to the risks to the upside that may affect the non-core component directly, most members mentioned the possibility that energy prices revert their trend or that agricultural and livestock product prices increase.",
        "One member stated that, in an environment of geopolitical tensions, the international price of crude oil may differ from its forecast.",
        "He/she warned that a higher crude oil price affects gasoline prices, limiting the scope of action of the federal government to stabilize them through adjustments to the special excise tax on production and services (IEPS, for its acronym in Spanish).",
        "As for risks to the downside for headline inflation, the majority of members highlighted that the peso exchange rate appreciates, which may possibly be associated with a context of more accommodative monetary policy stances and lower interest rates worldwide, or in case greater certainty regarding the trade relation with the United States is achieved.",
        "They also pointed out the possibility that slack conditions widen more than anticipated, as suggested by the latest information on economic activity, which might influence the behavior of core inflation.",
        "One member added the possibility that public finances improve.",
        "Regarding the risks to the downside that affect non-core inflation directly, most members mentioned that there may be lower rates of change in the prices of some of the goods included in this subindex, as has been the case with energy prices.",
        "One member pointed out that the price of gasoline may decrease if there is a fall in crude oil prices, given the greater weakness of the world economy.",
        "Most members agreed that significant uncertainty persists regarding the risks that might affect inflation.",
        "They considered that the net impact of inflation risks is uncertain since opposite effects are taking place.",
        "One member argued that, in his/her opinion, inflation risks have decreased significantly vis-à-vis those observed in December 2018, adding that this is due to several factors, such as the improvement in global financial conditions, which lessens the pressure on the peso exchange rate and, eventually, on inflation.",
        "The same member added that energy prices are expected to remain stable, in line with the federal government’s price fixing policy.",
        "He/she highlighted that the impact of the minimum wage on inflation has been only slightly significant, that slack conditions in the economy have been increasing, and that the balance of risks for growth remains clearly biased to the downside.",
        "Another member expressed that the balance of risks remains tilted to the upside, despite expectations of a greater economic slack and the recent monetary policy statements by the US Federal Reserve, as it remains to be seen if specific actions by this central bank materialize and in that case what their impact on inflation would be.",
        "The same member highlighted that as evidenced by the recent experience with the trade tensions with the U.S., and the changes in the credit rating or in the credit outlook of sovereign debt and of Pemex’s debt, the exchange rate might suddenly adjust due to domestic and external events.",
        "Such member added the risks of wage pressures being above productivity gains and of the behavior of non-core inflation.",
        "He/she noted that in his/her opinion, the convergence of inflation to the target in 2020 implies figures for that item of around 3%, when it is the case that its long-term average has been above such figure.",
        "One member argued that, as to the balance of risks for inflation, it is important to analyze the risks to non-core inflation on one side, and those to core inflation on the other, since the factors determining each component are different.",
        "He/she stated that, on the one hand, risks to non-core inflation are more symmetrical; that is, their occurrence may either favor or harm their dynamics, and they are also not affected by monetary policy; on the other hand, risks to core inflation are more asymmetrical and, in principle, susceptible to monetary policy actions.",
        "He/she considered that the balance of risks for core inflation seems to be biased to the upside, while that for noncore inflation is slightly biased to the downside.",
        "All members highlighted that, since the last monetary policy decision, domestic financial markets displayed episodes of volatility due to the threat of tariffs on US imports of Mexican products.",
        "The majority pointed out that the revisions to the outlook or the credit rating of the sovereign debt and that of Pemex by some rating agencies also contributed to the greater volatility.",
        "Nevertheless, they underlined that, in recent weeks, long- and medium-term nominal and real interest rates of government securities decreased significantly and that the peso exchange rate reverted the depreciation that was previously observed.",
        "Most members considered that this improvement was driven by the agreement reached between the governments of Mexico and the United States, the increase in risk appetite among investors given the outlook for more accommodative monetary policy stances in advanced economies, and the interest-rate spreads between Mexico and other economies.",
        "In this regard, one member mentioned that such spreads have mitigated capital outflows, mainly in public and private fixed income, although, given the prevailing uncertainty, there has been a rebalancing of government bond holdings towards long-term instruments, which partly explains the yield curve’s inversion.",
        "One member mentioned that longterm nominal and real interest rates provide useful information regarding the risk premia in the economy.",
        "He/she added that both yield curves are inverted, which may provide insights for the assessment of both the economy and the monetary policy stance.",
        "One of them pointed out that, in line with the significant improvement in global financial conditions since June, long-term interest rates on government securities are at their lowest levels of the year and have decreased in more than 100 basis points, the sovereign risk premium has slightly decreased and the Mexican Stock Exchange resumed an upward trend, after having fallen in May.",
        "The same member also highlighted that the peso has appreciated with respect to the levels observed at the end of 2018 and noted that the level of the exchange rate is sustained by interest rate spreads, by the trade agreement with the U.S. and Canada (USMCA) and its recent ratification by the Mexican Senate, by investors’ consent to the New Mexico City International Airport bond buyback offer, by the fight against fuel theft, and by the new administration’s commitment to fiscal discipline.",
        "In this regard, another member added that although long-term interest rates decreased in Mexico, they did so to a lesser extent than in other emerging economies.",
        "He/she pointed out that although Mexico’s favorable interest rate spread with respect to that observed in other emerging economies, has mitigated the adjustment of the exchange rate in the presence of shocks, the peso exchange rate against the US dollar has accumulated an appreciation similar to that observed in other Latin American currencies in Mexican economy.",
        "Most members warned that there are factors that may deteriorate the performance of financial assets in Mexico, such as the risks regarding the credit outlook of the sovereign debt and that of Pemex, as well as the uncertainty regarding the US-Mexico bilateral relationship.",
        "One member noted that, given the aforementioned risks, domestic assets are being traded at a discount vis-à-vis other similar emerging economies’ assets.",
        "Another member considered that the risks for domestic financial markets have been decreasing, although he/she acknowledged that those related to global and domestic economic weakness, as well as with Pemex’s situation, remain latent.",
        "Some members stated that the credit rating of both sovereign debt and Pemex’s debt were downgraded by one rating agency and that their credit outlook was revised from stable to negative by another one.",
        "One member pointed out that it is worth recalling that, although several Mexican financial assets and their derivatives —such as the credit default swaps— had already discounted the adjustment from BBB+ to BBB since several months ago, there is still concern regarding additional adjustments due to possible vulnerabilities coming from public finances.",
        "Another member noted that the rating agencies highlighted the following aspects to justify their decisions on their sovereign credit rating: i) the uncertainty regarding the implementation of public policies and their impact on investor’s confidence; ii) the changes and lack of clarity as to the energy policy; iii) the risks regarding Pemex’s financial situation and the uncertainty about its business plan; and, iv) the implications of the above described factors on public finances and on economic growth.",
        "Most members considered that addressing the deterioration of both the sovereign credit rating and that of Pemex is necessary.",
        "With regards to this company, one member highlighted that the rating agency that recently downgraded its credit rating mentioned that such adjustment reflected: i) the downgrading of the sovereign credit rating; ii) the continuing deterioration of Pemex’s financial profile; and, iii) the lack of investment to revert the decline in its production capacity.",
        "Another member stated that the fact that the decision to revise downwards the credit rating or outlook of Pemex’s debt was taken before the company announced its business plan is noteworthy.",
        "The majority emphasized that Pemex’s risk premium has deteriorated significantly.",
        "One member attributed such deterioration to the rating agencies’ actions, pointing out that, although the increase of Pemex’s debt risk premium has affected its financial cost, the impact on the financial cost of the sovereign debt has been limited, given that the sovereign debt risk premium decreased even while that of Pemex’s was increasing.",
        "Some members noted that markets are discounting the loss of Pemex’s investment grade by a second credit rating agency.",
        "They stated that the confirmation of this event might lead to forced sales of the company’s debt by investors, a process that may already be underway.",
        "One member mentioned that this would complicate even further not only the company’s financing capacity but of the overall economy, it could affect volatility in financial markets and compromise the consolidation of public finances.",
        "He/she noted that the price of Pemex’s external debt has deteriorated in the secondary market, which may imply a lower availability of resources in the future.",
        "Another member argued that Pemex’s loss of investment grade would not necessarily lead to episodes of financial volatility since such risk has already been discounted and the adjustments in investors’ portfolios may take place gradually.",
        "In this context, most members noted the importance of preventing an additional deterioration in the credit rating of Pemex’s debt.",
        "They noted that to improve the situation of the company, a clear and credible business plan is necessary, together with a mediumand long-term strategy focused on value generation and that improves the company’s access to financial markets.",
        "Nevertheless, one member warned that a solution for the company’s problems has not been offered yet.",
        "He/she noted that only isolated measures that affect the development of the energy sector have been announced, such as the cancellation of the last bidding rounds; the construction of the oil refinery in Dos Bocas; and the international arbitration process started by CFE against the builders of the Texas-Tuxpan sea-bed pipeline.",
        "Some members mentioned that in case the actions taken to reactivate oil production and restore the health of Pemex’s finances are insufficient, this would have important implications for public finances and in general for the economy.",
        "One member deemed it increasingly urgent to implement measures that address the challenges faced by this company.",
        "Some members warned that CFE’s financial situation also contributes to increase the vulnerability of public finances in Mexico.",
        "Most members highlighted that the current environment continues to pose significant mediumand long-term risks that could affect the country’s macroeconomic conditions, its capacity to grow, and the economy’s price formation process.",
        "One member noted that in light of a highly complex external situation and insufficient actions domestically to offset such complexity, the impact on investment and on potential growth might be significant, in an environment in which the latter seems to already be decreasing.",
        "In this regard, such member highlighted that private sector analysts’ expectations for Mexico’s economic growth rate over the next ten years lay only slightly above 2%.",
        "In this context, the majority pointed out that, in addition to a prudent and firm monetary policy, public finances must be consolidated in a sustainable way.",
        "One member argued that such consolidation is of paramount importance given that monetary policy’s room for maneuver increases in an environment of robust public finances.",
        "The majority added that measures to foster an environment of confidence and certainty for investment and higher productivity should be adopted, with one member pointing out the adoption of new technologies and the strengthening of human capital.",
        "Most members also mentioned that strengthening the rule of law, tackling corruption, and fighting insecurity are equally imperative.",
        "In this context, one member underlined the need to avoid the combination of an economic deceleration along with actions that could affect price formation, and pressure inflation above its target.",
        "As to public finances, most members warned that, in an environment of lower revenues, fiscal policy has little room for maneuver.",
        "In particular, one member pointed out that public sector’s total budgetary revenues, including Pemex, CFE, and other government agencies under direct budgetary control, were below the expected in the program.",
        "He/she noted that such reduction was due to the contraction of the oil production platform and to transitory decreases in VAT tax collection.",
        "He/she also stated that this situation may worsen if there is a greaterthan-expected economic deceleration.",
        "In addition, he/she emphasized that there is an under-spending of programmable budgetary resources in various items and that projections suggest that public sector revenues and spending will end the year with negative deviations vis-à-vis the levels programmed for 2019.",
        "Under such scenario, he/she noted that the public sector has limited room for maneuver to offset the revenue shortfalls.",
        "He/she emphasized that this may lead to a policy of raising the IEPS for fuels and/or to withdrawals from the Budget Revenue Stabilization Fund (Fondo de Estabilización de los another member added that, given its explicit commitment to fiscal consolidation, the federal government would not have margin to finance the deficit with debt nor have room for adjusting spending, which has already been reallocated to social programs that are difficult to cut down.",
        "In this regard, he/she highlighted that the lack of clarity and predictability regarding the direction of several public policies in strategic sectors, and an expenditure policy that has favored the redistribution of resources towards social transfers in detriment of public investment, are factors that continue undermining investors’ confidence and putting pressure on the dynamics of the economy and of public finances.",
        "Finally, one member highlighted that domestic banks have a robust capitalization level and a high liquidity level.",
        "He/she mentioned that these indicators reflect that banks are capable of responding to unexpected losses or stress situations that may arise in the short run.",
        "He/she concluded that the stress tests published in the last Financial Stability Report confirm the resilience of the Mexican banking system.",
        "The majority considered that the current monetary policy stance is consistent with the convergence of inflation to the target.",
        "However, they expressed their concern about the resistance to decline displayed by core inflation.",
        "One member stressed that such persistence has occurred despite the tight monetary policy stance and has been an obstacle to headline inflation’s convergence to the target.",
        "Another member argued that the core component is the one that more adequately reflects inflationary pressures in the economy and that it has remained at high levels despite the slowdown of economic activity.",
        "The majority mentioned that it is essential to monitor closely the evolution of core inflation and that it resumes its downward trend.",
        "One member added that core inflation’s persistence, coupled with the volatility of non-core inflation and a balance of risks for inflation that, in his/her opinion, is biased to the upside, could lead to a persistence of long-term headline inflation expectations above the target or to a de-anchoring of such expectations.",
        "Another member expressed his/her concern about the level of short-, medium- and long-term inflation expectations reflecting a lack of credibility in the central bank’s actions.",
        "The majority pointed out that expectations of a more accommodative monetary policy stance by the US Federal Reserve provides Banco de México greater room for maneuver.",
        "One member pointed out that monetary policy in Mexico is one of the most restrictive among emerging economies, adding that since May 2017, the policy rate in Mexico has been adjusted in a synchronized manner with that of the Fed, in such a way that the yield spread between Mexico and US interest rates has remained at around 575 basis points.",
        "He/she considered that given the latest developments observed in the path of inflation, economic growth and financial stability risks, a widening yield spread cannot be justified, so that in the event of a monetary policy easing in the United States, Banco de México should act accordingly, so that the current spread is maintained.",
        "Another member added that if a cut in the Fed’s target range for the federal funds rate were to take place, it would represent a challenge for monetary policy conduction in Mexico, since a widening in the yield spread between both countries could generate and additional tightening in monetary conditions in Mexico, although he/she stressed that this has not yet materialized.",
        "Some members mentioned that given the complex environment faced by inflation, it would not be convenient to ease the monetary policy stance if inflation does not show a clear trend towards the 3% target.",
        "One of them added that the possibility of weak economic growth coupled with persistent inflationary pressures in which the convergence of inflation to its target is delayed cannot be ruled out, and that if such a scenario materializes, monetary policy decisionmaking would become more complex.",
        "Another member argued that a downward adjustment of 25 basis points to the policy rate is necessary, given inflation’s favorable evolution, unfavorable expectations regarding economic growth and the outlook of a monetary policy easing in the United States.",
        "He/she added that, in his/her view, this adjustment in Mexico’s monetary policy stance would be consistent with the convergence of inflation to its target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates.",
        "He/she argued that the monetary policy statement should highlight that risks for inflation have decreased since December of last year, that inflation has behaved as expected by the central bank, and that it is foreseen to attain the inflation target in the near future.",
        "He/she mentioned that this would send a message of certainty and confidence to markets that inflation is under control and on the path towards the target.",
        "In this regard, he/she stated that the information provided by the central bank to economic agents serves to shape their own beliefs regarding the state of the economy, and therefore the tone of the central bank’s communications can become a mechanism for coordinating or confirming private agents’ beliefs.",
        "He/she stressed that the pessimistic tone of the recent monetary policy statements cannot be ruled out as being one of the reasons behind the recent increase in inflation expectations.",
        "Another member pointed out that if the behavior of inflation continues to be aligned with the convergence to its target, it will be necessary to begin a cycle of monetary policy easing in a relatively short horizon.",
        "He/she pointed out that there is the risk of maintaining a tight monetary policy for a prolonged period, to the detriment of economic growth, public finances and financial costs.",
        "However, he/she added that given the inflation risks, the decision to begin a cycle of policy rate cuts must be taken very prudently and cautiously.",
        "He/she pointed out that a premature easing of monetary policy could generate volatility in domestic financial markets and affect key variables for financial stability.",
        "In light of the aforementioned, he/she considered that, although the policy rate should not be adjusted on this occasion, the monetary policy statement should have a less restrictive tone.",
        "Most members agreed that monetary policy faces a complex juncture in which a high degree of uncertainty prevails and in which certain factors are putting downward pressure on inflation, while others are pushing it upwards.",
        "One member highlighted that it is to be expected that over the next months, the path of inflation will be very much influenced by the combined impact of the deceleration of economic activity, supply shocks from several sources, and the persistence of a situation of high uncertainty with potential effects on the exchange rate.",
        "He/she mentioned that the incidence in opposite directions on inflation of the above mentioned factors requires monetary policy to be managed with extreme caution.",
        "Such member underlined that there is still no evidence of a decline in core inflation and that although some inflation risks have slightly decreased, others such as those stemming from the trade relationship with the U.S. and with the sovereign and Pemex’s credit rating persists or have even intensified.",
        "He/she pointed out that under such circumstances, there is the risk that the path of the exchange rate exhibits fluctuations that are incompatible with the attainment of the inflation target in 2020.",
        "Such member concluded that the monetary policy adjustment must be based on convincing evidence of a sustained decrease of inflation towards the target, and that in an environment of increased economic slack and such high levels of uncertainty, Banco de México’s Governing Board must be prepared to respond in case of surprising events.",
        "Another member stated that although greater economic slack, together with an external environment of prevailing lower interest rates and a certain lack of vigor in the outlook for growth, point to an environment of lower inflationary pressures within the time frame in which monetary policy operates, there are other elements that are also influencing the domestic economy and price formation, especially when headline and core inflation are at levels above 3%, and have shown a resistance to decline, and several risks are still present.",
        "The majority agreed that under such challenges the central bank must maintain a prudent and cautious policy stance and monitor closely all determinants of inflation, its outlook, its balance of risks and the possible materialization of certain risks, in order to guarantee the convergence of inflation to its target.",
        "Finally, they stated that the central bank's communication should reflect that it will be attentive to taking the required monetary policy actions based on incoming information, and will act in a timely manner to guarantee the orderly convergence of inflation to its goal.",
        "To guide its monetary policy actions, Banco de México’s Governing Board follows closely the development of inflation vis-à-vis its forecasted trajectory, taking into account the monetary policy stance and the time frame in which monetary policy operates.",
        "In this process, it uses available information on all inflation determinants as well as on medium- and long-term inflation expectations, including the balance of risks for such factors.",
        "Monetary policy must also respond prudently if for any reason the uncertainty faced by the economy increases considerably.",
        "In this context, considering that the current monetary policy is consistent with the convergence of inflation to its target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates, Banco de México’s Governing Board decided by majority to maintain the target for the overnight interbank interest rate at 8.25%.",
        "One member voted to reduce the target by 25 basis points.",
        "Considering the challenges to consolidate a low and stable inflation as well as those the economy’s price formation is subject to and the amount of slack in the economy, the Governing Board will continue to follow closely all factors and elements of uncertainty that have an impact on inflation and its outlook and will take the required actions based on incoming information so that the policy rate is consistent with the orderly convergence of headline inflation to Banco de México’s target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates.",
        "Banco de México’s Governing Board will maintain a prudent monetary policy stance and, under the current environment of uncertainty, will follow closely the potential pass-through of exchange rate fluctuations to prices, Mexico’s monetary policy stance relative to that of the U.S. —in an external environment that it is still subject to risks— and the behavior of slack conditions and cost-related pressures in the economy.",
        "In the presence and possible persistence of factors that, by their nature, involve risks to both inflation and its expectations, monetary policy will be adjusted in a timely and firm manner to achieve the convergence of inflation to its medium- and long-term inflation expectations so that they attain such target.",
        "Alejandro Díaz de León-Carrillo, Irene EspinosaCantellano, Javier Eduardo Guzmán-Calafell and Jonathan Ernest Heath-Constable voted in favor of maintaining the target for the overnight interbank rate at 8.25%.",
        "Gerardo Esquivel-Hernández voted in favor of reducing the target for the overnight interbank rate by Inflation has exhibited a better performance than the one forecasted in previous Quarterly Reports and is on a convergent path to Banco de México’s target.",
        "Cumulative inflation for the first semester of the year will fluctuate around 0.30% and will be the second lowest figure so far this century.",
        "Annual figures for both headline as well as core inflation have been influenced (either directly or indirectly) by the increase in energy prices during the second semester of 2018.",
        "These effects, however, must fade in the second half of the year.",
        "Thus, I estimate that by December 2019, inflation will be very close to or even below 3.4%, that is, in line with the forecasts of last year’s Quarterly Reports.",
        "In addition to the above, there are other elements that must be considered in the determination of the target interest rate: the announced loosening of the monetary policy of advanced economies and the noticeable economic deceleration in the country.",
        "These factors open a space to be able to cut the interest rate in 25 basis points without putting at risk nor compromising the fundamental mandate of Banco de México.",
        "All members agreed that available indicators suggest that the weakening of world economic activity during the second half of 2018 continued during the early part of 2019, with a lower dynamism in most advanced and some emerging economies.",
        "In this context, some members stated that among the main factors of this deceleration are the trade tensions and the implementation of tariff measures between the U.S. and China, which have affected global trade and investment.",
        "One member called attention to persistent political and idiosyncratic factors.",
        "Another member pointed out that the deceleration of the global economy has been greater than anticipated.",
        "Most of the members acknowledged that such an environment has led to the decline in world growth expectations for 2019, one member adding that growth projections for 2020 have also been revised downwards.",
        "In this regard, some members noted that different timely and leading indicators continue showing weakness, which signals a significant deceleration in several regions of the world.",
        "However, some members claimed that it is possible to expect a certain rebound in the following quarters, insofar as the transitory factors that have affected the dynamism of some economies continue to dissipate and the stimulus measures announced in several economies begin to take effect.",
        "All members stated that the balance of risks to global growth remains biased to the downside and one pointed out that, despite the apparent moderation of some risk factors over the last weeks, other factors have intensified considerably.",
        "The majority agreed that among the main risks, the following stand out: i) an escalation of trade disputes between the U.S. and China; ii) a disorderly Brexit process; iii) a lowerthan-anticipated growth of the Chinese economy; iv) a sharper-than-expected deceleration in some economies due to idiosyncratic factors; and, v) political and geopolitical tensions.",
        "Regarding the first of these risks, one member warned that, although negotiations appear to be heading towards reaching an agreement, the risk of setbacks or episodes of intensification of the tensions between both countries has not disappeared.",
        "The same member added that tariff barriers —greater than those registered prior to the conflict — could be observed, even if an agreement between both economies is reached.",
        "As to the second risk, he/she mentioned that the probability of a scenario without a mutually convenient agreement between the U.K. and the European Union has apparently increased in the last days.",
        "Most members mentioned the lower dynamism in advanced economies, especially in the euro area and, to a lesser extent, in the U.S. One member delved into the fact that, although this group of countries continue having differences in their cyclical positions and in their inflationary gaps, the negative effects of trade disputes have contributed to a synchronized deceleration.",
        "Some members pointed out that the economic slowdown in the euro area has been greater than expected, and affected by idiosyncratic factors.",
        "One of them mentioned the case of Italy, which is already in recession, and of Germany, where manufacturing production has even started to show signs of contraction.",
        "One member considered that although some idiosyncratic factors that affected the euro area have already dissipated, the lower growth of external demand continues to affect the region’s dynamism.",
        "As for the deceleration of the US economy, another member stated that it was intensified by the fading of the transitory effects of the pro-cyclical fiscal stimulus adopted by that country.",
        "Another member mentioned that industrial production and exports seem to be suffering from the effects of the trade tensions and the global economic weakness, while the fiscal deficit has widened further.",
        "Most members stated that growth expectations for advanced economies have decreased.",
        "One of them stressed that, although the deceleration is widespread, reductions to growth forecasts vary, given that they have been considerable in the euro area, while in Japan and in the U.S. they have been of a smaller magnitude.",
        "However, most members emphasized that several financial indicators point to a higher probability of recession in the U.S. over the next 12 months.",
        "One member explained that although there are certain signals of a gradual recovery of private spending in the U.S., it is expected to grow at a lower rate than that registered during the previous quarter.",
        "As to emerging economies, most members mentioned the lower dynamism displayed by some of them, especially China, where the economic slowdown has been greater than anticipated.",
        "Nevertheless, some members considered that this slowdown could moderate as a result of the adopted fiscal and monetary stimuli.",
        "One of the members pointed out that the People’s Bank of China mentioned that there was still room to cut its reserve requirements, in an effort to generate more market liquidity, and that this could contribute to raise global growth towards the second half of 2019.",
        "Some members stated that such stimuli are limited by China’s own structural problems, such as the transition towards a more moderate growth as well as the vulnerabilities that prevail in that country, such as the high levels of public and private indebtedness.",
        "Regarding growth prospects for emerging economies, one member argued that a certain divergence among them persists, given that, although countries such as Argentina and Turkey are anticipated to continue contracting in the first half of the year, others like Brazil and India are anticipated to continue recovering.",
        "Another member pointed out that in an environment where lesser pressures from external markets are foreseen, the performance of emerging economies will be determined, to a large extent, by idiosyncratic risk factors and by the soundness of their macroeconomic fundamentals.",
        "All members emphasized that inflationary pressures have decreased worldwide, partly due to the decline in economic growth.",
        "Some members added that this has also been the result of lower prices of some commodities.",
        "Most members noted a continuous tightening in the labor markets of advanced economies.",
        "Some of them specified that wage growth has been accelerating and unemployment continues to decline.",
        "One of them added that, in certain cases, the unemployment rate has reached multiannual minimum levels.",
        "Most members specified that, despite the above, headline inflation in these countries is below their respective central bank targets, and one member pointed out that it has been declining.",
        "Another member mentioned that there are few pressures on prices associated with the labor market.",
        "When analyzing the evolution of inflation in advanced economies from a long-term perspective, one member warned that lower inflationary pressures reflect both the effects of the recent economic deceleration and the presence of other factors that have kept inflation structurally low.",
        "In particular, he/she considered that technological changes and globalization have allowed the fragmentation of the production processes for both goods and services according to the comparative advantages of different countries and regions.",
        "Such member added that this allowed the incorporation of the abundant workforce from Asia and Eastern Europe into the global economy and stressed that all of this has contributed to greater market competition, reducing the possibility of firms increasing their prices.",
        "He/she noted that the continued presence or weakening of these structural factors will be highly relevant for the future evolution of inflation.",
        "With regards to inflation in emerging economies, some members agreed that it declined due to the fall in energy and food prices, the fading of the effect of the depreciation of their currencies, and to the lower dynamism worldwide.",
        "One member pointed out that in some of these economies, headline inflation was close to their central banks’ targets, and in others it was even below such targets.",
        "All members mentioned that the described external environment has consolidated expectations that the main central banks will not tighten monetary conditions in the foreseeable future.",
        "Regarding the US Federal Reserve, they stated that in its policy decision of March, it left the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged and reaffirmed its message that it will be patient in making future adjustments.",
        "In this regard, most members stressed that the median of the Federal Open Market Committee projections suggests there will be no increases in the federal funds target range in 2019.",
        "One member underlined the adjustment in the target range’s expected trajectory by the members of the Federal Open Market Committee, from two increases this year to none.",
        "Another member mentioned that markets are beginning to consider the possibility of the next adjustment being to the downside.",
        "Most members underlined the Federal Reserve’s announcement of shrinking the rate of reduction of its securities holdings starting in May and concluding such process in September 2019.",
        "One member added that the central banks of Canada, the euro area, England and Japan did not adjust their policy rates in their March meetings either, and that they emphasized that the economic deceleration has been greater than expected.",
        "He/she added that, as a consequence of the latter, market variables are discounting that there will be no additional increases during the year in the policy rate of several of these countries.",
        "Most members agreed that during the first months of performed favorably, in light of expectations that the central banks of the main advanced economies will not tighten monetary conditions in the foreseeable future.",
        "One member added that the apparent decline in trade tensions between the U.S. and China as well as the measures announced by the Chinese government to address the deceleration of its economy also contributed to this development.",
        "Another member noted that financial conditions improved despite the international uncertainty, which entails the risk of an additional fall in economic activity.",
        "Some members stated that the main stock market indices registered gains, that government bond interest rates decreased, that there was a compression of corporate bond spreads and that risk appetite increased.",
        "Some members noted that the US yield curve inverted.",
        "One member specified that the latter was notorious in its shorter terms.",
        "Another member mentioned that this behavior, which was also observed in Canada, has been present in all the recent previous recessions in the U.S., since it anticipates problems to finance medium- and longterm projects and therefore informs us about a possible credit channel that can contribute decisively to the economic deceleration.",
        "As to financial markets of emerging economies, most members pointed out that these have also had a favorable performance, following the Federal Reserve’s announcement of a more cautious policy stance.",
        "One member specified that interest rates in most of these countries decreased and some mentioned the improved performance of their currencies.",
        "Most members mentioned that improved financial conditions have encouraged capital flows to emerging economies, while some members also attributed such flows, in part, to the significant interest rate spreads some of these economies have with respect to US rates.",
        "Most members indicated that, in the foreseeable future, although financial stress on emerging economies has diminished, the perceived risks to global economic growth could affect international financial markets and therefore the possibility of new episodes of financial volatility persists.",
        "Some members added the risk of surprises to the upside in the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy in view of possible unexpected increases in inflation.",
        "One of them argued that the implications of a slower normalization process should be seen with caution given that, although such process can ease pressures on domestic financial markets, at the same time it points to a lower expansion of the world economy, it extends the challenges to financial stability stemming from the persistence of low interest rates, and reduces monetary policy’s margin of response in the event of a weakening of economic activity.",
        "Most members noted that economic activity in Mexico decelerated at the end of 2018 and in early marked at the end of 2018.",
        "Another member mentioned that although GDP growth in the fourth quarter was positive, it is a cause of concern that both public and private investment have declined for three consecutive quarters, that exports have fallen for two consecutive quarters and that consumption has decreased in two out of the last three quarters.",
        "He/she added that the sum of the components of aggregate demand exhibited a contraction.",
        "In this context, most members mentioned that available information suggests that in early 2019 economic activity continued exhibiting low growth, although some of them specified that it has maintained a positive trajectory.",
        "Most members mentioned that the country’s economic performance was a consequence of the slowdown of the world economy, of some weakness in domestic demand, and of some transitory factors, such as the fuel distribution problems and the blocking of railways, which could have affected growth during the first quarter of the year.",
        "In this respect, another member clarified that there was no major spillover to other activities so that overall economic activity exhibited a slight increase in January.",
        "With regard to economic activity from the demand side, another member noted that both external and domestic demand seem to continue losing dynamism.",
        "Regarding external demand, some members mentioned that exports continue following an upward trend.",
        "However, some members warned that automotive exports to the U.S. remain weak.",
        "As for domestic demand, most members considered that consumption shows some deceleration and that investment continues on a negative trend.",
        "One of them elaborated that this is due especially to the weakness in purchases of machinery and equipment.",
        "In this context, he/she added that according to economic analysts interviewed by Banco de México, the current juncture’s investment climate is going through a bad moment.",
        "As for the performance of productive activities, some members mentioned that in January the Global Index of Economic Activity (IGAE) grew at a lower-than-anticipated monthly rate.",
        "With respect to industrial production, most members noted that it has shown weakness and, in particular, that manufacturing continues to show sluggishness and that mining remains on a downward trajectory.",
        "One member specified that within the mining sector, the decline in oil production is noteworthy.",
        "Another member mentioned that construction rebounded significantly during the first month of the year.",
        "Some members highlighted that the services sector has also decelerated.",
        "One member added that this behavior was observed in sectors that were most affected by the fuel distribution problems.",
        "Some members argued that it is yet to be seen if the observed economic deceleration is temporary.",
        "One member stated that it is not clear yet whether the lower dynamism is caused by the adjustment that always occurs at the beginning of a new administration or if it is a phenomenon associated with a new phase of the business cycle.",
        "The same member warned about the performance of the components of the Coincident Indicator of INEGI’s Cyclical Indicators System, which have shown declines for several consecutive months, which points to the beginning of a downward phase in the economic cycle.",
        "Such member argued that some of these components, such as the IGAE, the urban unemployment rate or the permanent IMSS-insured workers, have had a negative contribution for at least ten consecutive months.",
        "To put this into perspective, he/she added that the level of the coincident indicator in December 2018 was one of the lowest in the last 10 years and that the last time these levels were observed —with a downward trend— was in November 2008, at the onset of the last recession in Mexico.",
        "In the same vein, such member added that the inverted yield curve in Mexico anticipates the possibility of recession.",
        "In this sense, most members noted that in light of the deceleration in Mexico, both Banco de México as well as private sector analysts and multilateral entities have revised downwards their growth expectations for 2019.",
        "One of the members mentioned that given the lower global dynamism, especially in the U.S., a certain deceleration of foreign trade and, in consequence, a lower demand for Mexican exports, will continue to be observed.",
        "Some members highlighted that precisely exports have been one of the country’s main growth drivers over the last 25 years.",
        "As to the dynamism of domestic demand, one member stated that consumption is anticipated to continue weakening.",
        "However, another member noted that, given the decline in growth expectations, the increase in consumer confidence, which is at historical highs, is striking.",
        "In addition, some members commented that signs of an economic recovery starting from the second quarter of 2019 are to be expected, once the transitory factors that have affected economic activity dissipate.",
        "One of them noted that, considering that the beginning of a new administration is always complex for circumstantial reasons and not necessarily for structural ones, the performance of public spending in the next months will be key for said economic recovery and to subsequently boost private investment.",
        "All members agreed that the balance of risks for growth remains biased to the downside.",
        "One member pointed out that this bias is observed in both the short- and medium-term horizons.",
        "In addition to the global risks described above, most members mentioned other downward risks for growth of domestic nature, among which the following stand out: i) that the current environment of uncertainty that has kept investment at low levels, and that may lead to lower levels of consumer expenditure, persists or deteriorates; ii) that a downgrading in the credit rating of State-owned productive companies or of the sovereign itself materializes; iii) that public spending is exercised with a longer delay than would normally occur at the beginning of an administration; iv) risks stemming from the ratification process of the new free-trade agreement with the U.S. and Canada; and v) the possibility of a slower-than-expected recovery in oil production.",
        "Regarding the first risk, some members explained that the uncertainty originated by the lack of clarity on several public policies may hinder the recovery of private investment and consumption.",
        "In this context, one member added that the uncertainty could also make consumers reduce their spending for precautionary reasons, while another pointed out that the main action to strengthen economic activity in the current scenario is the creation of conditions of confidence that promote an upturn of investment.",
        "To the above mentioned risks, one member added the possibility of tax revenues decreasing in relation to their projections, which may limit the performance of public spending; that the recent stagnation of automotive exports to the U.S. persists; and that the real exchange rate appreciates, thus discouraging non-oil exports.",
        "Another member pointed out that an additional risk is that the effects of the transitory factors that have affected the economy turn out to be greater than expected or that this type of events occur again.",
        "Finally, some members mentioned that several risks to medium-term growth persist, including the possibility of a recession in the U.S. As to the upward risks for growth, one member noted a greater-than-expected dynamism of the US economy; the approval and implementation of the new North America free trade agreement; a better performance of one or several components of GDP from the spending side; the possibility of a greaterthan-expected rebound effect arising from a low base of comparison; and greater-than-expected returns on the government’s new investment projects.",
        "In this context, another member stated that there are at least three factors that could contribute to an economic growth rate that would not be as low as might be anticipated: i) the increase in consumer confidence; ii) the positive effect in consumption that the new social programs focused on segments of the population, such as elder adults and young people, with a high propensity to consume, may have; and iii) the slight 3% increase in the real wage of IMSSinsured workers.",
        "Similarly, the same member mentioned that an escalation of trade tensions between China and the U.S. may benefit Mexico, as a result of the natural redirectioning of certain bilateral trade flows between those countries.",
        "Most members considered that slack conditions in the economy loosened towards the end of 2018 and in the early part of 2019, and some members highlighted that this confirms the existence of a negative output gap.",
        "Nevertheless, one member pointed out that, excluding oil production, the latest output gap indicators remained neutral and that, although labor market indicators continue exhibiting tightness, they appear to have loosened at the margin.",
        "Another member noted that such conditions were still tight at the end of 2018 and stated that, in the current situation, an accurate assessment of the economy’s business cycle stage is complex due to: i) the fact that the recent evolution of the economy may have been affected by transitory factors; ii) that, given the decline in investment and the unfavorable evolution of productivity, that the economy’s growth potential is probably contracting, which further complicates the estimation of the output gap; and, iii) that, regardless of the recent increases in the unemployment rate, such rate continues to be below its long-term levels.",
        "Finally, most members stated that, considering the forecasts for growth, slack conditions in the economy are expected to widen in the following quarters.",
        "Some members noted that this would lead to a negative output gap.",
        "All members mentioned that between January and the first half of March 2019, annual headline inflation decreased from 4.37 to 3.95%.",
        "Most members highlighted that, since the first half of February, it remained within the range of variability around the time this occurs since December 2016.",
        "The same member pointed out that, during the last six fortnights, inflation fell by 105 basis points.",
        "However, he/she argued that it is unclear whether this path is sustainable in the long term.",
        "In this regard, another member noted that, although it has improved at the margin, the reading for the first half of March was slightly above that of February.",
        "One member added that headline inflation has been affected by significant adjustments stemming from both the exchange rate and from pressures to non-core inflation, particularly energy prices.",
        "Another member argued that latest figures point to a significant fall in inflation and reveal a behavior consistent with the forecast trajectory of convergence to the target in the time frame in which monetary policy operates.",
        "The same member pointed out that the average of the last six figures of annualized headline and core inflation suggests that price increases have grown at decreasing rates.",
        "He/she added that inflation seems to be converging to the target faster than expected and that it is exhibiting a significantly better path than that described in the forecasts published in Banco de México’s Quarterly Reports of the third and fourth quarters of 2018.",
        "One member considered that the recent decline in inflation is explained by the fall in non-core inflation, and that it has been accompanied by worrisome elements.",
        "He/she highlighted among these the considerable persistence of core inflation; the fact that it has exceeded the central bank’s projections, in a context of frequent upward revisions of its future trajectory; short-, medium- and long-term inflation expectations above the central bank’s forecasts and above the 3% target; long-term core inflation expectations at the highest levels that have been recorded, and gradually getting closer to those for headline inflation, which could imply a deeper entrenchment of expectations at levels above the target; and estimates of compensation for inflationary expectations and inflationary risk implied by market instruments which are still at relatively high levels.",
        "Most members agreed that the reduction in headline inflation was mainly due to the fall in non-core inflation from 6.81% in January to 5.39% in the first half of March.",
        "Such members pointed out that this component decreased by 385 basis points in the last six fortnights.",
        "Some members noted that this decrease was a reflection of the lower increases in energy and in agricultural and livestock product prices.",
        "Nevertheless, some members stated that some of the favorable shocks that have led to the fall in non-core inflation have started to revert recently.",
        "In particular, the prices of energy goods rose during the second half of February, reflecting the increase in their international references.",
        "As to core inflation, most members noted that it decreased from 3.60 to 3.51% between January and the first half of March 2019.",
        "As to the dynamics of its components, most members mentioned that inflation of certain services remains high.",
        "Similarly, some members pointed out that food merchandise inflation has increased.",
        "Most members agreed that core inflation’s resistance to decline is worrisome.",
        "Some members underlined that for the last eleven months, the cumulative fall in core inflation has been of barely two tenths of a percentage point.",
        "One member underlined that core inflation has remained above shown a basically lateral behavior over the last eleven months.",
        "Nevertheless, one member considered that core inflation has broken through the months and has apparently started a downward phase consistent with the forecasts of convergence to the target.",
        "Regarding inflation expectations, most members mentioned that, between January and February, the median of headline inflation expectations for the end of 2019 and for 2020 fell from 3.80 to 3.65% and from out that the median of expectations for 2019 is above Banco de México’s forecast for the end of the year.",
        "As to core inflation expectations, most members pointed out that, between January and February, their median for 2019 remained at 3.50% and that for Additionally, some members described as mixed the behavior of inflation expectations drawn from surveys.",
        "However, one member stated that it is worth mentioning that considering the aforementioned decline in expectations, a change in trend of these indicators has occurred given that, between May and November 2018, headline and core inflation expectations had been increasing constantly and significantly.",
        "Regarding medium and long-term inflation expectations, most members highlighted that those corresponding to headline inflation continue above the permanent target of 3%, at levels around 3.50%.",
        "Regarding medium-term core inflation expectations, such members stated that these increased from 3.42% to 3.50%, while those for the long term remained at 3.40%, after having been at 3.30% during most of 2018.",
        "Some members emphasized that the latter are at historically high levels.",
        "As for information drawn from market instruments, most members pointed out that although the medium- and long-term inflationary risk premium decreased, it still remains at high levels.",
        "In this regard, one member pointed out that this premium implied in the 10-year bond has continued to decrease as stress in debt markets has faded.",
        "Another member said that although some risk premia have increased, those that are more closely linked to monetary conditions have been decreasing.",
        "As to the outlook for headline inflation, most members considered that it is feasible that it will converge to the 3% target towards the first half of in inflation is anticipated in the coming months due to a higher trajectory for energy prices.",
        "Some members pointed out that the above is also due to a low base of comparison in the previous year and that this trend should begin to reverse in June.",
        "One of the members added that this means that the perception of favorable developments in inflation in the short term will fade rapidly.",
        "However, another member stated that, if the observed path continues, the inflation target may be reached within the timeframe in which monetary policy operates.",
        "As to the forecasts for non-core inflation, some members mentioned that, despite its recent decline, some of its components, particularly energy prices, are expected to exert upward pressure on this subindex in the following months.",
        "In this regard, one member explained that the decline in non-core inflation resulted from a reduction in the growth rates of agricultural and livestock product prices and of energy prices.",
        "The same member added that the former are highly volatile, while the latter are very likely to increase in the following months due to their seasonality.",
        "In this context, the same member argued that it is foreseeable that non-core inflation increases.",
        "Another member indicated that, from March 2020 core inflation is anticipated to decrease in view of expectations of a more appreciated peso exchange rate.",
        "Some members added that this component would also be subject to downward pressures as a result of greater slack.",
        "As for upward risks to inflation, most members highlighted the possibility that the peso exchange rate is pressured by external or domestic factors.",
        "One member added that, in his/her opinion, this continues to represent one of the main risks for inflation.",
        "Most members pointed out that inflation could also be affected if additional pressures on energy prices or on agricultural and livestock product prices arise, if an escalation of protectionist and compensatory measures worldwide materializes or in case public finances deteriorate.",
        "One member noted that the latter risk is important, because one of the fundamental pillars of price stability is having sustainable public finances, and emphasized that their deterioration could increase medium and longterm inflation expectations.",
        "In this regard, another member pointed out that public finances could weaken given the fall in oil production and the weakening of economic activity.",
        "Additionally, most members agreed that, given the magnitude of the minimum wage increases, in addition to their possible direct impact, there is also the risk that these bring about wage revisions that exceed productivity gains and give rise to cost pressures, affecting formal employment and prices.",
        "One member estimated that the materialization of these pressures would imply a greater resistance of core inflation to decline or even additional pressures on this subindex.",
        "Some members pointed out that this year wage growth appears to be accelerating.",
        "In this regard, some members emphasized that the significant increase in the minimum wage level in the country’s border zone has raised the possibility of observing a lighthouse effect, that is, that the 100% increase affects also contractual wage demands for those salaries that are above the minimum wage.",
        "One of the members added that this effect might be observed in firms both at the border zone as well as in the rest of the country.",
        "Another member stressed that, up to now, there is no evidence that increases in the minimum wage level have led to significant inflationary pressures.",
        "He/she argued that in the case of the northern border, where these pressures could have been higher due to the greater increase in the minimum wage level, available information does not suggest an inflationary pattern different from that of the rest of the country.",
        "In this regard, another member argued that the new policy of improving the purchasing power of minimum wages is praiseworthy and necessary, but acknowledged that, for this policy to be functional, it must be implemented within a plausible horizon, in order to assess it and ensure that the economy can absorb such increases without generating inflationary pressures.",
        "Some members argued that, in order to raise the purchasing power of wages in a sustained manner, the role of other public policies must be considered, such as fostering competition in the markets for those goods and services with a high share in the consumption basket of the low-income population.",
        "Most members pointed out that the persistence exhibited by core inflation could lead to a greater resistance to decline of long-term inflation expectations.",
        "In this regard, one member expressed concern about the persistence of such subindex at levels above the target, and within this subindex, about the annual rate of change of services prices other than housing and education continuing at high levels.",
        "As for downside risks, some members mentioned the possibility of observing lower price variations in the prices of certain goods included in the non-core subindex or a greater-than-foreseen widening of slack conditions.",
        "In sum, the majority of the members agreed that although there has been an intensification of some of the downside risk factors, there continue to be others that might put upward pressure on inflation in greater magnitude and make it deviate from its foreseen path, therefore they highlighted that there still persists an upward bias in the balance of risk to inflation with respect to its forecast trajectory.",
        "One member stated that the balance of risks for inflation is relatively stable, and that several of the risk factors for inflation have been easing in recent weeks.",
        "Most members pointed out that, since the last monetary policy decision, financial assets in Mexico have exhibited a positive performance reflecting both the more favorable conditions that have prevailed in international financial markets as well as Mexico’s monetary policy stance relative to that of other economies.",
        "Regarding the performance of the Mexican peso, one member noted that it appreciated slightly during this period, with an improvement in the measures of depth and volatility of the foreign exchange market.",
        "Some members considered that the Mexican peso has remained relatively stable since the end of December 2018.",
        "In this context, one member mentioned that the Mexican peso has reversed the losses observed at the end of 2018 and that the current low levels of volatility had not been observed since, at least, 2014.",
        "Another member highlighted that this behavior is noteworthy and reflects certain calmness despite the uncertainty associated with the change of administration and the start of a government with novel policies.",
        "One member emphasized that the performance of domestic markets was mixed, pointing out in this regard, that, although the Mexican peso had appreciated during part of the period since the monetary policy decision of February, such trend was recently reversed in view of concerns regarding the weakening of the world economy, thus the peso underwent a slight depreciation.",
        "As to interest rates, most members mentioned that those of government securities decreased significantly during the period and that trading conditions in this market improved.",
        "One member pointed out that inflows to the fixed income market from foreign investors have continued, although in lesser magnitude than in previous months.",
        "In regards to Mexico’s stock market, the same member underlined that this market fell, as a reflection of the latest quarterly results, which showed a deceleration of revenue growth and profit margins, stating that this might have been further influenced by the downward revisions in growth forecasts for the Mexican economy.",
        "As to sovereign risk premia, most members highlighted that they remained at high levels similar to those observed in the latest monetary policy decision while one member stated that they registered a decrease.",
        "Some members mentioned that the current levels of such premia are higher than those of other economies with a credit rating similar or even lower, than that of Mexico.",
        "In this regard, most members stressed that the presence of risk factors and uncertainty associated with the Mexican economy has led to an additional discount or risk premium for domestic assets.",
        "Most members stated that risk factors persist that could affect the performance of domestic financial markets, among which Pemex's financial situation, its future economic viability and the implications this could have on its credit rating stand out.",
        "Such members noted that a deterioration in the credit rating of the state-owned company could lead to a revision in the rating of the country's sovereign debt, reducing the availability of financial resources for the economy and possibly causing episodes of volatility in Mexican financial assets as well as significant adjustments in investment portfolios.",
        "In this regard, one member warned that Pemex's debt accounts for a significant share in the portfolio of several institutional investors dedicated to emerging economies, which have exposure to a wide range of Mexican assets.",
        "Another member pointed out the nervousness of investors given the potential loss of Pemex’s investment grade and the possible revision of the country’s sovereign rating.",
        "In this context, all members considered that Pemex’s financial challenges are a risk factor for the country's macroeconomic stability, as a deterioration of its credit rating could increase not only the cost of the country’s sovereign debt, but also that of the private sector debt.",
        "One member added that the latter would affect businesses and households, making public and private investment more expensive, affecting overall spending as well.",
        "The same member considered that this could lead to a downturn in economic activity and, eventually, to a deterioration in the credit portfolio of commercial banks.",
        "In this regard, most members highlighted the possible announcement of support measures for Pemex by the federal government.",
        "Some members agreed that the support could improve the company’s short-term outlook, but most members pointed out that it should primarily address structural problems, strengthening its medium- and long-term capacity to generate value by means of a credible and functional business plan.",
        "One member argued that the measures announced so far to repair the company’s financial position, although relevant, have been considered insufficient by the markets.",
        "This member indicated that, unless Pemex adopts a business model that allows a sustained recovery of its oil production capacity and that guarantees its financial viability without affecting the perspectives for solid public finances in the long run, such actions might be counterproductive, because they would probably not avoid a rating cut for Pemex, they would increase the vulnerability of public finances and they would affect the sovereign’s risk.",
        "Another member mentioned that the proposal of using part of the funds from the Budget Revenue Stabilization Fund support to Pemex as well as allowing the use of this fund as a countercyclical fiscal policy tool can have positive effects, but also entails risks.",
        "This member noted that the effectiveness of the support will not only depend on the amount, but on the destination of the resources.",
        "Finally, most members agreed that the support to be granted to Pemex should not affect the fiscal balance, in order to avoid an impact on Mexico’s sovereign risk.",
        "Most members emphasized the importance of sound public finances, so that together with a prudent monetary policy, a solid macroeconomic stance is maintained allowing the economy to face adverse scenarios.",
        "Such members also pointed out the importance of achieving the goal established in the of GDP.",
        "One member noted that, since the last monetary policy decision, concerns regarding insufficient public revenues relative to the projections in the Federal Income Law have increased.",
        "He/she mentioned that this could be the result of lower tax collection as a consequence of lower economic growth than forecast in the 2019 Economic Package, or from a greater-than-expected decline in the oil production platform.",
        "Some members considered that the current environment continues to pose significant risks in the medium and long terms, which could affect the country’s macroeconomic conditions, its growth potential and the economy’s price formation process.",
        "Some members mentioned that, for this reason, it is necessary to adopt economic policy measures that foster an environment of confidence and certainty for investment, promote higher productivity, adequate resource allocation, competition, technological progress and human capital formation, and that also narrow opportunity gaps.",
        "Such members emphasized that, in order to achieve the abovementioned, it is necessary to strengthen institutions, to enforce the rule of law, to effectively fight corruption and to bring down insecurity.",
        "One member mentioned that, in particular, it is crucial to try to avoid the combination of an economic deceleration with the adoption of certain policies that might generate higher levels of inflation and maintain it above the target.",
        "He/she also pointed out that, in the presence of different adverse shocks, the Mexican economy has had to adjust to a lesser availability of external financial resources.",
        "Such member stated that this has required a significant depreciation of the real exchange rate and a further strengthening of macroeconomic policy.",
        "The same member considered that in order for this adjustment to be orderly and with the least possible impact on GDP, the exchange rate has to function as an adjustment variable and inflation must remain contained and near its target.",
        "He/she concluded that, for this reason, both monetary and fiscal policies had to be reinforced.",
        "All members agreed that the current monetary policy stance is consistent with the convergence of inflation to its target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates.",
        "One member added that the foreseen trends of headline, core and non-core inflation seem to be the result of the credibility of Banco de México’s decisions and of the functioning of monetary policy’s transmission channels.",
        "Some members argued that the expectations of monetary policies in advanced economies more relaxed than previously anticipated increases the room for maneuver for monetary policy conduction in Mexico.",
        "Nevertheless, one member mentioned that although the moderation of expectations regarding monetary normalization in advanced economies diminishes the risks for monetary policy in Mexico, it does not change significantly the inflationary scenario faced by the Mexican economy.",
        "Most members mentioned that slack conditions in the economy are foreseen to widen over the next quarters.",
        "In this regard, one member noted that Banco de México should monitor that the tight monetary policy does not remain in place for too long, in case the economy’s slack conditions continue to widen.",
        "He/she considered that, otherwise, there is the risk of generating an overadjustment of economic activity.",
        "In line with the above, such member argued that the recent behavior of total investment is concerning, since this variable has stagnated over the last years and has fallen in recent months.",
        "The same member warned that it is evident that this behavior cannot be decoupled from the high real interest rate levels prevailing in Mexico, since the policy interest rate is at its highest levels of the last 10 years.",
        "Such member added that, although the high interest rates contributed significantly to financial stability and to diminish inflationary pressures, partly due to an increase in capital inflows and to an appreciation of the Mexican peso, the prevalence of these interest rates at high levels could eventually contribute to generate undesired downward pressures on economic activity — especially in the export sector— and also to attract too-volatile capital inflows, which could increase the instability and vulnerability of the foreign exchange market in the long term.",
        "Such member concluded that, in this environment, the balance of risks for growth is clearly biased to the downside, while that for inflation is stable and, for this reason, unless something extraordinary occurs, the upward cycle of interest rates should be thought of as concluded.",
        "The same member underlined that the necessary room to begin a downward adjustment in the policy rate could be created in the near future, given that he/she considers that the level of such rate is consistent with the convergence of inflation to its target, and depending on how inflation behaves in the next weeks.",
        "Another member warned that if the current monetary policy is relaxed too soon, significant increases in volatility could be observed in domestic financial markets and this could have an impact on financial stability.",
        "While the same member agreed on the need to measure the negative consequences of maintaining a tight monetary policy for too long, he/she stressed the importance of considering the scope and limitations of monetary policy.",
        "The same member explained that monetary policy has only one instrument: the policy interest rate which aims to achieve a single objective, price stability.",
        "Such member emphasized that the latter is a necessary condition to achieve sustained growth in economic activity, but it is far from being a sufficient condition.",
        "He/she stressed that when monetary policy is used to attain two objectives, such as to contribute to improve public finances or to try to boost economic growth in the short term, it loses its effectiveness and there’s the risk of not achieving any of the objectives at all.",
        "Such member mentioned that monetary policy can influence the cyclical behavior of the economy around its growth trend in the long term, but not the trend itself.",
        "The same member argued that, for this reason, the most important and solid contribution that monetary policy can make to the healthy economic development of the country is to seek price stability.",
        "The same member also stressed the importance of taking into consideration the natural lag with which monetary policy operates and in which it can effectively contribute to the commitment to price stability.",
        "Most members expressed their concern about the persistence exhibited by core inflation.",
        "One member pointed out that such concern stems from the fact that the current monetary policy has been restrictive since early 2018, with an ex-ante real interest rate above its neutral level and that it is this component that should respond most to monetary policy actions.",
        "Another member added that its evolution should be a focus of attention for the central bank, given the degree of interrelation between inflation and its expectations.",
        "One member underlined that despite the tight monetary policy, the path of inflation foreseen by economic analysts is markedly above Banco de México's forecast.",
        "He/she argued that core inflation expectations for 2019 and 2020 suggest that core inflation will remain at its current levels, that is, analysts expect core inflation will not decrease in the next two years.",
        "He/she expressed that the fact that long-term expectations are at 3.50% might be of concern.",
        "However, he/she argued that, considering that such expectations are \"adaptive\", they could decrease in the medium term when inflation converges to its target.",
        "Another member noted that the increase in medium and long-term core inflation expectations is a cause of unease for the central bank.",
        "One member stressed that given the persistence of a situation of high uncertainty and upside risks to inflation, monetary policy must continue to emphasize prudence and the strengthening of its credibility.",
        "He/she indicated that in this sense, economic analysts' generalized forecasts of an easing of monetary policy in Mexico in a context in which short and long- term inflation expectations are above the 3% target are surprising.",
        "He/she highlighted that this suggests that the evolution of the reference rates drawn from analysts’ surveys and from market instruments is not consistent, in their view, with the convergence of inflation to the target for the first half of 2020.",
        "He/she stated that, given the macroeconomic environment that is currently foreseen, achieving this will require a firm monetary policy to be in place for a prolonged period.",
        "Likewise, this and another member agreed that the behavior of inflation expectations described above reflects lack of credibility regarding the 3% target.",
        "Most members mentioned that a prudent and firm monetary policy must be maintained in order to attain the convergence of inflation to its target in the time frame in which monetary policy operates and to promote the converge of inflation expectations to persistence of an environment of high uncertainty and of upward risks for inflation.",
        "One member pointed out that the contribution of persistence to core inflation is asymmetrical, that is, it increases more when inflation rises and persists for a long time when inflation decreases.",
        "He/she highlighted that, for this reason, it is essential to have patience when implementing a tight monetary policy in the periods after inflation increased significantly.",
        "Most members agreed that Banco de México must communicate a clear signal of prudence and commitment to its price stability mandate.",
        "Such members pointed out that the central bank will continue following closely the evolution of inflation, its determinants and its expectations and will adjust its monetary policy stance if necessary.",
        "To guide its monetary policy actions, Banco de México’s Governing Board follows closely the development of inflation vis-à-vis its forecasted trajectory, taking into account the monetary policy stance and the time frame in which monetary policy operates, as well as available information on all inflation determinants and on medium- and longterm inflation expectations, including the balance of risks for such factors.",
        "Monetary policy must respond prudently if for any reason the uncertainty faced by the economy increases considerably.",
        "In this context, considering that the recent developments in inflation and its main determinants have not changed significantly with respect to their foreseen path, that the cyclical position of the economy has loosened somewhat, and that the current monetary policy stance is consistent with the convergence of inflation to its target, Banco de México’s Governing Board decided unanimously to leave the target for the overnight interbank interest rate unchanged at stable inflation as well as those the economy’s price formation is subject to, the Governing Board will take the necessary actions so that the reference rate is kept at a level consistent with the convergence of headline inflation to Banco de México’s target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates.",
        "Banco de México’s Governing Board will maintain a prudent monetary policy stance and, under the current environment of uncertainty, will follow closely the potential pass-through of exchange rate fluctuations to prices, Mexico’s monetary policy stance relative to that of the U.S. —in an external environment that it is still subject to risks — and the behavior of slack conditions in the Mexican economy.",
        "In the presence and possible persistence of factors that, by their nature, involve risks to both inflation and inflation expectations, monetary policy will be adjusted in a timely and firm manner to achieve the convergence of inflation to its 3% target and to strengthen the anchoring of medium- and long-term inflation expectations so that they attain such target.",
        "Alejandro Díaz de León-Carrillo, Irene EspinosaCantellano, Gerardo Esquivel-Hernández, Javier Eduardo Guzmán-Calafell and Jonathan Ernest Heath-Constable voted in favor of leaving the target for the overnight interbank interest rate unchanged at 8.25%.",
        "Against the Monetary Policy Statement (press Although I agreed with the decision to keep the target interest rate level constant, I do not agree with the press release that informs about such decision.",
        "Specifically, I differ on both the restrictive tone that characterizes it as well as the conclusion reached with respect to the balance of risks to inflation.",
        "In regards to the first issue, I consider that the recent evolution of the different indicators of inflation in Mexico described in such document as well as the policy changes announced recently by the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, opened up the space for a press release with a more neutral tone.",
        "In regards to the second issue, I consider that the downside risks to inflation due to both a perspective for conditions of greater slack in the Mexican economy as well as a foreseeable worldwide economic deceleration, are high enough as to balance the potential upward risks that are identified in the document.",
        "It is worth adding that, in my assessment, the concerns about the potential impact on inflation of the increase in the minimum wage level or of a possible exchange rate passthrough, are smaller than as reflected in the monetary policy statement.",
        "All members agreed that towards the end of 2018 the world economy decelerated, with most advanced and some emerging economies showing less dynamism.",
        "One member mentioned that, although the weakening of the global economy has been persistent, it has occurred at a moderate rate.",
        "Some members argued that such deceleration was sharper than expected, due partly to the escalation of trade disputes and to idiosyncratic and geopolitical factors.",
        "Some members noted the negative performance that coincident and leading indicators are recently showing.",
        "One member pointed out the negative evolution of industrial production, investment spending, and global trade flows for advanced and, more recently, for emerging economies.",
        "As for the outlook for global economic activity, all members stated that growth expectations for this year have been revised downwards on an ongoing basis, while some added that forecasts for 2020 have also been reduced.",
        "One member noted that trade tensions, mainly those between the U.S. and China, have contributed to the downward revision of growth expectations.",
        "As for the balance of risks to global growth, most members stated that it is significantly biased to the downside and one pointed out that it has deteriorated.",
        "Most members agreed that, among the main risks, the following stand out: i) an escalation of trade disputes; ii) a lower-than-expected economic growth of the Chinese economy; and, iii) political, geopolitical, and idiosyncratic factors.",
        "In relation to the first of these risks, most members highlighted the uncertainty surrounding the trade disputes between the U.S. and China.",
        "In this regard, one member warned that, although the negotiations within the ninety-day-period agreed to in December appear to be progressing satisfactorily, it is not possible to rule out a scenario of greater trade barriers between both economies starting in March, which would have effects on the world economy.",
        "As for the second risk, another member argued that the Chinese economy registered its lowest growth rate since the beginning of the 1990s and that a significant decline in ChinaU.S.",
        "trade can already be observed.",
        "The same member added that this lower dynamism would lead to a deceleration of global demand for basic commodities, with a negative effect on global trade.",
        "In regards to the third risk, some members mentioned that international financial markets may react abruptly to developments of either economic, political or geopolitical nature, with spillover effects on the real economy.",
        "One member pointed out that vulnerable emerging economies would be particularly affected.",
        "Among these events, most members noted the possibility of a Brexit process without mutually convenient agreements between the U.K. and the European Union, as well as prospects of a resumption of the U.S. government shutdown.",
        "Some members stated that the uncertainty stemming from such factors has translated into a warning of a further decline in economic activity.",
        "One member noted that business confidence has been affected by both the impact of the aforementioned developments on the real economy and the uncertainty and volatility that they have generated in markets.",
        "Most members highlighted the lower dynamism of economic activity and continued divergence among the main advanced economies.",
        "In this regard, some members pointed out that the U.S. has decelerated less than other advanced economies.",
        "One member attributed this difference, among other factors, to the transitory effects of the procyclical fiscal stance adopted by this country during the mature phase of its business cycle.",
        "Another member mentioned that the economic contraction of the Eurozone has become more visible due to the deceleration of external demand and the presence of transitory factors that have affected industrial production in certain economies, in addition to business confidence remaining in negative terrain.",
        "Regarding growth expectations of advanced economies, most members agreed that those for 2019 and 2020 have been revised downwards on an ongoing basis.",
        "The majority highlighted that in the particular case of the U.S., the uncertainty about the outlook for its growth persists and the probability of a recession over the next 12 months has even increased.",
        "In this regard, some members noted that some financial variables suggest the possibility of a recession.",
        "Nevertheless, one member acknowledged that the change in the Federal Reserve’s message regarding future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate and the possible moderation of the balance sheet reduction process could mitigate or postpone the possibility of such recession.",
        "Other members stated that the outlook for deceleration in the U.S. is associated with the fading fiscal incentives, a progressively less expansionary monetary policy stance, the economic costs of the partial government shutdown, and the decline in investment.",
        "Regarding emerging economies, most members mentioned that their economic growth has weakened and that forecasts about their growth rate have been revised downwards.",
        "One member pointed out that the deceleration of China is a risk factor for other emerging economies, both directly through a reduction in trade, and indirectly through lower commodity prices.",
        "Most members highlighted that the Chinese economy has decelerated more than the other emerging economies and that the risk of a lower-than-expected dynamism prevails.",
        "One member noted that economic growth estimates for China have been declining steadily and in a sustained manner.",
        "In this regard, some members underlined the willingness of the Chinese authorities to seek an orderly adjustment in the transition to a more moderate and balanced growth by considering the adoption of fiscal, monetary and regulatory easing measures.",
        "One member stated that, to reverse the negative impact of the trade dispute with the U.S., the People’s Bank of China relaxed its reserve requirements, pointing out that it will grant improved financing conditions to small and medium enterprises.",
        "Most members noted that due to the lower economic dynamism and the fall in energy prices, inflationary pressures have moderated worldwide.",
        "As for such pressures in advanced economies, most members mentioned that these have decreased, while some of them added that pressures have decreased in both headline and core inflation.",
        "Some members emphasized that this has occurred notwithstanding the tightening of their labor markets and faster wage growth.",
        "As for the U.S., some members pointed out that headline inflation is near the Fed’s 2% target, while in the Eurozone and Japan inflation is still below the targets of their central banks.",
        "Continuing with the U.S., one member stated that there are no signs of possible inflationary pressures in the foreseeable future, except for a possible impact stemming from wage pressures on its labor market.",
        "One member added that the behavior of the prices of food and of some industrial metals, as well as the favorable performance of core inflation in some emerging economies, have also contributed to diminish inflationary pressures worldwide.",
        "As for inflation in emerging economies, another member underlined that it decreased due to the fall in crude oil and food prices, the fading effect of the depreciation of their currencies on prices, and lower global dynamism.",
        "All Governing Board members highlighted that the lower dynamism of global economic activity has been reflected in expectations of a slower monetary policy normalization by the major central banks, and in lower short- and long-term interest rates in the United States.",
        "Most members added that, as expected, in January, the U.S. Federal Reserve left the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged.",
        "Such members mentioned that this central bank stated that it will be patient in making future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate.",
        "Some members indicated that the Fed sent clear signals that the upward trend of interest rates will stop at least for some time, eliminating from its statement all references to additional rises.",
        "In this regard, one member highlighted the change in the Federal Reserve’s policy stance.",
        "Another member noted that, in this environment, market variables no longer incorporate the possibility of an additional increase in the reference rate during this year and are even starting to discount a decrease in interest rates in 2020.",
        "Additionally, most members pointed out that the Fed stated that it could adjust its balance sheet normalization program if necessary, one member adding that the balance sheet normalization program could end sooner and at a higher level than expected.",
        "Nevertheless, another member warned that, in a context of an economic downturn but with forecasts for GDP growth above potential for this year, there are greater challenges in terms of the assessment of the economy’s cyclical position as well as in terms of communication.",
        "Therefore, the same member estimated that surprises in the monetary normalization process cannot be ruled out.",
        "From a longer-term perspective, another member argued that, since the years after the 2008 crisis, the Federal Reserve has used forward guidance to exert a greater influence on expectations for short-term interest rates along the entire yield curve and strengthen its effects on aggregate demand.",
        "The same member considered that this policy was useful for the cyclical recovery of the U.S. economy, but that it has faced significant challenges in the current phase of the cycle.",
        "In this regard, he/she highlighted that, albeit having announced several years ago that the withdrawal of monetary stimulus was to be gradual and preannounced, this type of guidance and commitment faces significant challenges when the monetary policy stance is close to a possible inflection point or when it faces an environment of high uncertainty.",
        "He/she pointed out that this has occurred in recent months, when the cyclical path of the U.S. economy has become more uncertain.",
        "He/she mentioned that this situation led to a considerable adjustment in the Fed’s message, which in September appeared to be operating under a prescheduled strategy, while by the end of December and in January, it announced that its actions would be determined on the basis of incoming information.",
        "Another member underlined that, on the one hand, the central banks of the Eurozone and Japan left their reference rates unchanged, stating that the Bank of Japan pointed out that it will continue with a highly accommodative monetary policy for a prolonged period.",
        "The same member mentioned that, on the other hand, the central banks of most emerging economies left their monetary policy stances unchanged and several of them have stated that they will remain vigilant to developments and incoming data that may jeopardize the convergence of inflation to their targets.",
        "Most members mentioned that, recently, financial markets in both advanced and emerging economies have exhibited a more favorable performance associated, to a large extent, with the greater caution with which the central banks of advanced economies, particularly the U.S. Federal Reserve, have stated they will proceed henceforth.",
        "Some members agreed that interest rates in these economies decreased and one member noted that this decrease was more significant in the U.S.",
        "Some members highlighted that the yield curve in that country flattened considerably.",
        "Most members stated that this has been reflected in an appreciation of most emerging economies currencies against the U.S. dollar.",
        "One member emphasized that the best performing currencies were those exhibiting greater interest rates spreads vis-à-vis advanced economies.",
        "Some members underlined that as a result of this environment, emerging economies have registered significant capital inflows.",
        "Nevertheless, most members warned about the persistence of certain risks, whose materialization may affect financial markets significantly.",
        "Some members pointed out that the global economic deceleration might sharpen and lead to greater financial volatility, reversing the apparent increase in risk appetite.",
        "One member added that tight financial conditions may become even tighter than they already are.",
        "In this regard, some members warned that financial markets were already affected in 2018, precisely by a deterioration of growth forecasts due to the materialization of some risks to the global economy.",
        "One member recalled that the abovementioned led to a lower risk appetite.",
        "The same member pointed out that the initial adjustment in financial markets to an environment of increasing interest rates implied a downward adjustment in stock markets and high credit risk spreads, thus tightening financial conditions.",
        "He/she stated that, towards the end of 2018, markets recovered as expectations of lower interest rates consolidated gradually.",
        "Finally, he/she underlined that now that lower pressures from external markets are expected, the performance of emerging economies will be determined, to a larger extent, by idiosyncratic risk factors and by the soundness of their macroeconomic fundamentals.",
        "As for economic activity in Mexico, most members highlighted that during the fourth quarter of 2018, it decelerated significantly as compared to the previous quarter.",
        "One member mentioned that this deceleration is due to transitory factors as well as others of a more persistent nature and that, thus, the rate of economic growth continued on a downward trend which has been observed since 2016.",
        "Some members stated that the evolution of the labor market also suggests a weakening of economic activity during such period.",
        "One member noted that latest figures for the fourth quarter of 2018 imply that growth for the entire year was 2% and indicate the effects of some factors that have affected growth negatively.",
        "On the demand side, most members agreed that consumption showed signs of deceleration during the fourth quarter of 2018.",
        "Nevertheless, one member pointed out that, overall, consumption continued on a positive trend supported by the recovery of the total wage bill and the dynamism of revenues from remittances, which, during 2018, reached historical highs of above 33 billion USD.",
        "Most members mentioned that private investment continued following a downward trend and one member stated that this is due to the lower spending in both construction and machinery and equipment.",
        "The majority of members noted that in the last quarter of 2018 manufacturing exports maintained a level similar to that of the third quarter.",
        "One member mentioned that in December imports fell drastically vis-à-vis the previous month.",
        "Another member pointed out that the public sector is anticipated to have continued being a drag on aggregate demand at the end of 2018.",
        "One member noted that recent indicators suggest that the weakening of economic activity during the fourth quarter of 2018 may extend to the beginning of 2019.",
        "As an example, the same member highlighted that consumption started showing signs of deceleration for the first time.",
        "Another member stated that it remains to be known if the economic slowdown is transitory, resulting from the adjustment that usually occurs at the beginning of a new administration, or if it is a phenomenon associated with a new phase of the economy’s business cycle.",
        "The same member argued that maybe the most evident sign of this latter phenomenon is what is reflected in the trend of all the components of the Coincident Indicator of INEGI’s Cyclical Indicators System, which have contributed negatively to this indicator for at least four consecutive months, and stated that some of these components have been contributing negatively to such indicator for at least nine consecutive months.",
        "He/she stated that the last time that such indicator reached a level as low as that of November 2018 with a negative trend was between November and December 2008, right at the beginning of Mexico’s last recession.",
        "One member mentioned that there is not enough statistical information available to make an accurate assessment of economic activity for the beginning of the economy may weaken further during the first quarter of 2019, given that no changes have been observed in the fundamental determinants that have recently been affecting the economy, highlighting the complex international environment and the global slowdown, and a domestic environment of persisting uncertainty.",
        "Such member added that in addition to the aforementioned, the impact of the transitory shocks should also be considered, especially the shortage of fuel in several regions of the country, the blockage of railroads in Michoacán, the labor conflicts in Tamaulipas, and the U.S. government shutdown.",
        "In this context, the same member pointed out that growth forecasts for the next two years have deteriorated, and that it is foreseen for 2019 that the economy will expand less than what was observed in 2018 and then strengthen slightly in 2020.",
        "In this regard, some members warned that such forecasts are subject to a higher degree of uncertainty.",
        "One member added that a negative growth rate for the first quarter of 2019 would not be surprising.",
        "Another member considered that the environment for growth for 2019 will depend on the public policies to be implemented.",
        "Most members highlighted that private sector specialists have revised downwards their growth forecasts for 2019.",
        "Another member delved into the dispersion of such forecasts, which increased between December 2018 and January pointed out that the range for such forecasts decreased during the same period.",
        "Another member mentioned that the most worrying concern is the deteriorating prospects for growth, as gross fixed investment has remained stalled for three consecutive years and consumption and exports have not exhibited sufficient dynamism to foster higher growth.",
        "The same member added that the start of every six-year administration is always complicated and is now accompanied by additional transitory challenges, such as those associated with fuel distribution, the blocking of transportation routes, and the labor conflicts in the state of Tamaulipas.",
        "Such member expressed his/her view that starting out with a persistent environment of caution for investment in addition to the direct and indirect effects originated by the aforementioned developments, a stronger emotional constraint must also be considered.",
        "All members said that the balance of risks to growth is biased to the downside: one member added that the downward bias is present in both short- and medium-term horizons and some members noted that the balance of risks has deteriorated.",
        "One of them argued that there are external and domestic factors that have substantially increased the uncertainty about the country’s economic performance.",
        "The majority warned that in the beginning of 2019 transitory factors that could affect the growth rate during the first quarter of this year have been observed.",
        "One stressed that it is estimated that the shortage of fuel in some states will have a negative effect on GDP growth in the first quarter of 2019, which will depend on its intensity and duration.",
        "In addition to the global risks described above, the majority mentioned other downside risks for growth, such as: i) obstacles in the ratification of the trade agreements reached between Mexico, the United States and Canada; ii) factors leading to greater domestic uncertainty and less confidence in the outlook for the Mexican economy; and, iii) certain delays in the execution of public expenditure related to the beginning of a new administration.",
        "In this regard, one member added that, given the lower global dynamism, the country will face a certain deceleration in foreign trade, which has been one of Mexico’s main growth drivers in recent years.",
        "Another member warned that the substantial reallocation of public expenditure can translate into greater delays and inefficiencies in resource allocation and weaken economic activity to a larger extent than normally observed at the beginning of a new administration.",
        "One added the uncertainty about public policies in the next years, which according to such member is hindering the recovery of business confidence from its very low levels.",
        "In addition, some warned that a lower-than-expected growth would reduce tax collection, and would make it difficult to execute public expenditure in the second half of this year.",
        "As upside risks for growth, some members pointed out the important increase in consumer confidence.",
        "One member added that there could be a positive effect from new social programs, which could boost the domestic market given their focus on segments of the population, such as seniors and young people, which have a high propensity to consume.",
        "Another member added as a risk the possibility that economic policy and public expenditure begin making a positive contribution to economic growth, which could surprise to the upside towards the second half of the year or towards 2020.",
        "In addition, such member mentioned that, given the deterioration in growth expectations, the unusual increase in consumer confidence is striking, which was especially motivated by the perception of the country's future economic situation, currently at historical highs.",
        "The same member noted that there is an exceptional contrast with business confidence, which has not really changed in the past months.",
        "However, such member specified that the latter indicator has improved in the past couple of years and that it maintains a path which is slightly above the 50-point threshold.",
        "The same member noted that consumer perception about the country’s future economic situation is better than that of business owners, while that of the future situation of households is practically aligned with the future perception of businesses.",
        "In this regard, such member pointed out that despite the events of recent months and the deterioration in growth projections, firms maintain positive expectations, while consumers have more confidence in government actions.",
        "The same member concluded that it is possible that these confidence levels favor consumption and an eventual recovery in private investment, which could translate into a better economic performance during the second half of the year or by 2020.",
        "Most members considered that slack conditions in the economy relaxed towards the end of 2018 and the beginning of this year, and one member highlighted that these slack indicators have remained at less tight levels than those registered at the beginning of 2018.",
        "In this regard, another member pointed out that with indicators which exclude oil production these conditions remained neutral.",
        "As to the labor market, some noted the rise in the unemployment rate at the end of 2018, and one noted the deceleration in the creation of IMSSinsured jobs during the last quarter of 2018.",
        "This last member indicated that labor market figures might have been affected by factors related to the present juncture, such as the cancelation of the New Mexico City International Airport’s construction, which would also have been reflected in economic activity in general.",
        "Some members mentioned that, notwithstanding the latter, the labor market remains tight.",
        "Some pointed out that slack conditions in the economy are expected to widen in the coming quarters and indicated that it is very likely that during the period of influence of monetary policy the output gap with and without oil production begins to lie in the negative region.",
        "One of them noted that it is relevant to consider that the economy is currently in a situation with an output gap that is not very different from zero.",
        "The majority pointed out that from November to January, headline inflation decreased, some members specifying that it went from 4.72% to mentioned that this decrease was mainly due to the reduction of non-core inflation.",
        "One of them indicated that headline inflation continued with the downward trend shown since September.",
        "Another member warned that although this reading points in the right direction, it is early to conclude that inflation has returned to a clear downward path.",
        "He/she added that coincident and prospective indicators associated with prices suggest that despite the marginal improvement, the inflationary process continues to show a strong resistance to decline.",
        "Likewise, one member remarked that the decrease in January was due to one-time adjustments, such as the reduction of the VAT in the border region.",
        "Another expressed that headline inflation has been affected by the significant adjustments in the real exchange rate.",
        "However, one member stated that the latest inflation figures are in line with their anticipated path of gradual convergence to the target in the horizon in which monetary policy operates.",
        "As for the components of headline inflation, all members highlighted that core inflation continues to show a resistance to decline and some of them pointed out that it went from 3.63% in November to inflation has remained around 3.6% in the last 10 months.",
        "One member emphasized that it shows a high persistence which for several months has prevented it from decreasing at the desired speed.",
        "Some members indicated that, given that core inflation is a more appropriate indicator of fundamental pressures on prices and it is the component that should respond more to monetary policy actions, its persistence is a matter of concern.",
        "Nevertheless, another member stated that despite its rigidity, core inflation seems to have started a downward trend.",
        "With regards to the factors that explain core inflation’s behavior, some members mentioned the increase in prices of services other than housing and education, as well as the indirect effects of increases in energy prices.",
        "One member added to the above the indirect effects of recent increases in the prices of some fruits and vegetables.",
        "Another member mentioned also the impact of the exchange rate, the tight economic conditions observed until recently, and the real wage increases during 2018.",
        "Regarding non-core inflation, some members stated that it fell from 8.07% to 6.81% between November and January.",
        "Some mentioned that this reflects lower increases in energy prices and livestock products, although such effect was partially offset by greater increases in the prices of some fruits and vegetables.",
        "One member indicated that the recent trends of core and non-core inflation seem to be associated with the credibility of Banco de México’s monetary policy decisions and to the operation of monetary policy’s real transmission channels.",
        "The majority mentioned that headline inflation expectations for 2019 and 2020 showed a clear deterioration in December and some improvement in January.",
        "They highlighted that those corresponding to the end of 2019 went from 3.71% in October to in January.",
        "Some noted that those corresponding to the end of 2020 were adjusted upwards from 3.5% to 3.79% and then downwards to 3.71% in the same comparison periods.",
        "Regarding core inflation expectations for the end of 2019, the majority emphasized that they went from 3.45% in October to rated the behavior of inflation expectations drawn from surveys as mixed, since those of headline inflation improved from December to January, while those of core inflation did not.",
        "One member stated that both headline inflation and core inflation expectations had a shift in trend, since between May and December 2018 both had been increasing steadily and significantly.",
        "Some members stressed that core inflation’s persistence has even contaminated inflation expectations, one member adding that, in particular, it has had an influence on medium-term expectations.",
        "The majority indicated that headline inflation expectations for the medium and long terms still stand above the permanent target of 3%, at levels of around 3.50%.",
        "One member pointed out that a convergence of long-term core inflation expectations to the levels of headline inflation can be observed.",
        "As for information derived from market-based instruments, some stressed that medium- and longterm inflation risk premium showed a deterioration by the end of 2018 and subsequently decreased, although it continues at high levels.",
        "One highlighted that these levels continue to suggest significant upward risks for inflation in the medium and long terms.",
        "Some members noted that inflation forecasts suggest that inflation is following a downward trajectory in line with Banco de México’s last Quarterly Report.",
        "One member highlighted that it is estimated that forecasts for the next 12 months will have mixed revisions.",
        "As for the outlook for headline inflation, a member mentioned that it has been affected significantly by non-core inflation, which has also put pressure on core inflation, albeit its effects have slightly decreased.",
        "Some members highlighted an upward revision of core inflation during the first semester of the year because of its resistance to decline.",
        "One member emphasized that this can affect the convergence of headline inflation to its target.",
        "Another member cautioned that the risk of inflationary pressures that are not consistent with the attainment of the target within the expected timeframe persists, and that a larger number of favorable observations is necessary to confirm that risks of possible second round-round effects have started to dissipate.",
        "Nevertheless, one member indicated that the latest figures suggest that the paths of headline, core and non-core inflation could be converging even faster than as indicated in the last Quarterly Report.",
        "Most members considered that the balance of risks with regards to the expected path of inflation continues to be biased to the upside, in an environment of marked uncertainty.",
        "One of them indicated that the upward bias is slight and another one that inflation faces a more benign scenario than at the time of the previous monetary policy statement.",
        "As for the main risks to the upside for inflation, the majority highlighted the possibility that the peso exchange rate continues to be pressured by external and domestic factors, one of them adding that in his/her opinion this is one of the main risks for inflation in the near future.",
        "The majority mentioned that inflation could also be affected in case that new pressures on the prices of energy or agricultural products are observed, or if there is an escalation of protectionist and compensatory measures worldwide, or in case public finances deteriorate.",
        "One of them pointed out that this last risk has intensified.",
        "Some members indicated that a further continuation of the problems in fuel distribution as well as the blocking of railways and labor conflicts, are also risks for inflation.",
        "Additionally, the majority agreed that, given the magnitude of the recent increases in the minimum wage, beyond their possible direct impact, there is the risk that these lead to wage revisions that exceed productivity gains and thus generate cost pressures, affecting formal employment and prices.",
        "One member expressed that the above would imply a higher resistance or even additional pressures on core inflation.",
        "One of them alerted to the possibility of secondround effects in the price formation process.",
        "Most members warned about core inflation’s persistence, which could lead to a higher resistance to decline for long-term inflation expectations.",
        "One of them highlighted that it is particularly worrisome that core inflation is expected to remain in coming months above the level that was forecast only recently.",
        "Additionally, some members insisted that inflation expectations implied by financial market instruments continue signaling upward risks to inflation.",
        "One of them pointed out that the above can be observed for the medium and long terms, and another one argued that expectations drawn from surveys also signal the same risk.",
        "One of them added that inflation expectations drawn from surveys show a contrasting behavior, with those for 2019 and 2020 linked to headline inflation beginning to decline, while those focused on core inflation registering a slight upward trend.",
        "He/she pointed out that in the case of longterm inflation expectations, although those corresponding to headline inflation have remained stable at around 3.5%, there is a convergence of those corresponding to core inflation towards the levels of those of headline inflation.",
        "He/she argued that, if it continues, this trend would represent a deterioration of long-term inflation expectations, since it would imply a stronger anchoring of such expectations at levels above the target.",
        "Another one argued that such upward trend as well as the decreased dispersion among forecast answers in the survey, at levels above the target in the last few months, suggest a risk of contagion of long-term inflation expectations.",
        "Regarding downside risks, some members mentioned the possibility of smaller variations in the prices of certain goods included in the non-core index, or that slack conditions widen more than expected.",
        "All members highlighted that since the last monetary policy decision, financial asset prices in Mexico exhibited a more favorable performance.",
        "Most of them agreed that this was a reflection of more favorable external conditions and of domestic factors such as the approval of the economic package for included fiscal targets that were in line with market expectations; investors’ consent to the New Mexico City International Airport bond buyback offer; and, the implementation of a prudent monetary policy with interest rate spreads above those of other economies.",
        "All members pointed out that the peso exchange rate appreciated and reduced its volatility while one member added that the foreign exchange market’s operating conditions had improved and that analysts’ exchange rate expectations had been revised downwards.",
        "The majority pointed out that risk premia and long- and medium-term interest rates decreased, and some of them mentioned that operating conditions in government securities markets also improved.",
        "One member mentioned that foreign investment inflows have been observed, in particular, to government securities.",
        "Regarding the stock market, most mentioned that in line with the appreciation of the peso and the decline in interest rates, it registered gains during the same period, and some of them indicated that it has reversed the losses observed in the last quarter of 2018.",
        "Most members emphasized that, recently, domestic financial markets resented Fitch’s revision of Pemex's credit rating from BBB+ to BBB- with a negative outlook, albeit one member pointing out that such revision had already been anticipated by markets.",
        "One member stressed that, despite the latter, sovereign risk premia have not been affected, although an impact on them cannot be ruled out if this situation deteriorates.",
        "The majority of members mentioned that although financial asset prices in the country have exhibited positive results, the peso-US dollar exchange rate, medium- and long-term interest rates, and risk premia are at levels higher than those registered at the beginning of October, before domestic uncertainty escalated as a result of factors such as the announcement of the cancellation of the New Mexico City International Airport, the presentation of some legislative projects and raising concerns about the business model of Pemex.",
        "In this regard, one member mentioned that an environment of high uncertainty prevails in domestic financial markets, especially related with domestic factors.",
        "Another member mentioned that the balance of macro-financial risks has deteriorated due to the increasing uncertainty about the country's economic and financial environment.",
        "The same member added that this could mean lower inflows of foreign investment (direct and portfolio) to the country, with its subsequent impact on the exchange rate.",
        "Another member pointed out that future episodes of volatility in domestic financial assets in response to external and/or domestic factors cannot be ruled out.",
        "From a longer-term perspective, one member stated that in recent years the economy has faced two major shocks: i) a lower availability of external resources; and ii) a significant deterioration in the oil trade balance.",
        "The combination of both shocks has led to a major adjustment of the non-oil trade balance.",
        "Such member acknowledged that the economy has also been affected by uncertainty about the trade relationship with North America, the process of monetary policy normalization in the United States and other idiosyncratic factors.",
        "The same member argued that this has required a significant depreciation of the real exchange rate and that for such an adjustment to take place in an orderly way and without affecting domestic output, the nominal exchange rate must be flexible, and inflation must remain contained and close to its target.",
        "Such member added that this process requires the combination of a sound fiscal policy and a responsible monetary policy stance to prevent the contagion of inflation expectations and the deterioration of the price formation process.",
        "Also, that the economy still faces a significant tightening of external financing which is imperative to reverse.",
        "In this regard, another member highlighted that the greatest risk of not mitigating the country’s economic and financial uncertainty is the possibility of having lower inflows of foreign investment (direct and portfolio), with the subsequent increases in risk premia that would make credit more expensive, thus hampering the country’s economic recovery.",
        "Most members considered that the current environment continues facing medium- and longterm risks that might affect the country’s macroeconomic conditions.",
        "Among such risks, the majority of the members mentioned: Pemex’s financial fragility and outlook, and, in particular, an additional downgrade to its credit rating as it could have an impact on the federal government’s financial cost and, in general, on the country’s conditions for accessing external financing.",
        "One member pointed out that the business strategy to be adopted by Pemex will play a key role in determining the shortand medium-term outlook for the Mexican economy.",
        "The same member added the latter is due not only to the size of the oil company and its connection with many other corporations and domestic financial institutions, but also to its relevant role in domestic and international financial markets, stressing the importance of Pemex’s debt in the portfolio of different asset management institutions specialized in emerging markets.",
        "Another member pointed out that the recently announced actions to improve the financial situation of Pemex represent a positive element, but that additional efforts to strengthen the oil company’s production capacity and its financial outlook and, therefore, credibility on the fiscal targets for the short and long terms are required.",
        "The same member stated that the intention of the authorities to announce shortly a set of measures to face these challenges is highly relevant, given that greater hardships faced by Pemex would significantly affect public finances and, in general, the overall economy.",
        "Most members mentioned that a potential financial support to Pemex by the federal government or a reduction in its fiscal burden addressing its structural problems could mitigate the aforementioned risks, as long as these measures are consistent with the fiscal targets set by the government.",
        "Most members pointed out that in order to foster higher growth it is key to consolidate a solid macroeconomic framework as well as measures that contribute to raise productivity levels.",
        "In this regard, some stated that it is relevant to ensure an environment of confidence and certainty for investment and that public finances are consolidated sustainably.",
        "As a risk for the latter, some members highlighted, besides the already mentioned financial fragility of Pemex, the possibility of a lower-thanexpected GDP growth, which might affect tax collection and put at risk the attainment of the fiscal targets.",
        "One member added that it is important that the primary surplus target of 1% for 2019 is achieved.",
        "Finally, some members pointed out that the macroeconomic framework that accompanied the fiscal package for 2019 presented last December contributed to increase investors’ confidence and generated a positive response from markets.",
        "As to measures to boost productivity, some members considered that public policies must foster an efficient allocation of resources in the economy.",
        "In this regard, one member emphasized that the policies affecting price formation, as well as the higher minimum wages and the guaranteed prices are a cause for concern.",
        "Some members pointed out the need to ensure the Rule of law and tackle the challenges of public insecurity, corruption and impunity.",
        "In addition to these measures, another member considered the need for adopting public policies that support the strengthening of human capital, the adoption of new technologies, the narrowing of opportunity gaps, and the generation of adequate incentives for growth and development.",
        "Another member highlighted the need to carefully assess the implications of the current strategy for long-term growth and to introduce corrective measures when needed, particularly because of the economy’s low potential growth and the risks to the economy stemming from the continuous contraction in investment ratios.",
        "Most members acknowledged that the weakness of investment is a factor that may affect the country’s productivity and future growth.",
        "One member added that it is desirable that the new public investment is channeled to projects of proven economic and social returns.",
        "All members agreed that Mexico’s economic activity decelerated and that its balance of risks continues to be biased to the downside.",
        "One member considered that, in principle, the country’s economic deceleration should favor a faster process of inflation reduction.",
        "Nevertheless, the same member noted that, under the current juncture, inflationary risks stemming from Mexico’s complex economic and financial environment persist.",
        "Another member stated that the current environment features dilemmas and risk in the short- medium- and longterms, adding that it is clear that the challenges to the economy and to inflation are not only of a cyclical nature.",
        "In this regard, he/she underlined that it is important to avoid a situation with a period of weak economic growth and where also other factors that affect the price formation process keep inflation under pressure and above its target.",
        "Most members agreed that the evolution of headline inflation has remained in line with the forecast published at the end of November in Banco de México’s past Quarterly Report and that core inflation continues to exhibit a resistance to decline.",
        "One member mentioned that this is a cause for concern since such component should be responding more clearly to the monetary policy actions.",
        "Another member highlighted that although core inflation has shown resistance to decline, it is starting to follow a downward trend.",
        "Most members pointed out that Banco de México should maintain a prudent approach and signal clearly its commitment with its price stability mandate.",
        "In this regard, most members considered that the current monetary policy stance is consistent with the convergence of headline inflation to the target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates.",
        "One member added that the outlook that inflation is facing, in addition to the persistent risk of a de-anchoring of inflation expectations, suggest that the monetary policy tightening implemented should be kept in place for a lengthy period.",
        "Another member argued that the central bank should remain vigilant to the conditions prevailing in Mexico’s economy so that a very restrictive monetary policy stance is not in place for too long, in case the economy’s slack conditions continue to widen significantly.",
        "One member underlined that the combination of a weakening economic activity, on the one hand, and persistent inflationary pressures with a balance of risks to the upside and short-term and long-term inflation expectations above Banco de México’s projections, on the other, intensifies the challenges for monetary policy.",
        "The same member argued that monetary policy must focus on attaining the inflation target, but considering the high uncertainty prevailing as well as the effects of the evolution of economic activity on prices and the need of an orderly and efficient convergence of inflation to the target.",
        "He/she pointed out that the latter requires a prudent approach in which monetary policy decisions will depend fundamentally on additional information on inflation, its determinants and outlook, and which must be aimed at strengthening the central bank’s credibility.",
        "Such member indicated that given the aforementioned, additional adjustments to the monetary policy rate cannot be discarded.",
        "One member emphasized that the central bank message should not reflect an easing of monetary policy stance given the weakening of economic activity, but rather convey the persistence of risks to inflation, thus strengthening monetary policy’s credibility.",
        "The same member added that the central bank’s communication should reflect the concern for core inflation’s resistance to decline in spite of the clearly restrictive monetary policy stance so far adopted.",
        "Some members mentioned that the rises in the reference rate have increased interest rate spreads vis-à-vis other countries, thereby helping to mitigate the volatility that financial markets have exhibited due to external and domestic factors.",
        "One of the members stated that, given the expectations of more gradual and smaller increases in interest rates in advanced economies, Banco de México would have a slightly wider margin as to its monetary policy decisions.",
        "Most members highlighted the importance of pointing out that Banco de México’s Governing Board will remain vigilant to the evolution of inflation, its determinants and expectations and, that if necessary, it will take the actions required to attain the inflation target.",
        "To guide its monetary policy actions, Banco de México’s Governing Board follows closely the development of inflation vis-à-vis its forecast trajectory, taking into account the monetary policy stance adopted and the time frame in which monetary policy operates, as well as available information on all inflation determinants and on medium- and long-term inflation expectations, including the balance of risks for such factors.",
        "In this context, considering that the recent developments in inflation and its main determinants have not changed significantly with respect to their foreseen trajectories, that the cyclical position of the economy has loosened somewhat, and that the current monetary policy stance is consistent with the convergence of inflation to its target, Banco de México’s Governing Board has decided unanimously to leave the target for the overnight interbank interest rate unchanged at 8.25%.",
        "Considering the risks inflation is subject to, the Governing Board will take the necessary actions so that the reference rate is kept at a level consistent with the convergence of headline inflation to Banco de México’s target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates.",
        "Banco de México’s Governing Board will maintain a prudent monetary policy stance and, under the current environment of uncertainty, will follow closely the potential pass-through of exchange rate fluctuations to prices, the monetary policy stance relative to that of the U.S., under an external environment that it is still subject to risks, and to the behavior of the conditions of slack in the Mexican economy.",
        "In the presence and possible persistence of factors that, by their nature, involve risks to both inflation and inflation expectations, monetary policy will be adjusted in a timely and robust manner to achieve the convergence of inflation to its 3% target and to strengthen the anchoring of medium- and long-term inflation expectations so that they attain such target.",
        "Alejandro Díaz de León-Carrillo, Irene EspinosaCantellano, Gerardo Esquivel-Hernández, Jonathan Ernest Heath-Constable and Javier Eduardo Guzmán-Calafell voted in favor of leaving the target for the overnight interbank rate (target rate) unchanged at 8.25%.",
        "Most members agreed that since the second half of downward trend, although it recovered moderately during the first quarter of 2019 in some economies, such as the U.S., the U.K, the euro area and China, largely associated with transitory factors.",
        "In particular, some members claimed that this recovery was a result of the fiscal and monetary stimuli in such countries.",
        "As for growth expectations, most members noted that these are still being revised downwards.",
        "One member mentioned that the International Monetary Fund’s forecasts for 2019 decreased in a generalized manner, and another one pointed out that the probability of new downward revisions for this year and the next one apparently has increased.",
        "In this context, most members agreed that the outlook for investment has deteriorated and business climate worldwide has worsened.",
        "One member stated that some analysts expect a gradual deceleration in global economic activity and a low risk of recession.",
        "He/she added that given the more adverse environment for world trade, manufacturing has been one of the most affected sectors and that, on the demand side, investment has been affected by the impact of this environment on global value chains.",
        "In contrast, he/she stated that services, which is a more labor intensive sector and is less exposed to global trade, has continued to expand in the major economies, supporting consumption and the labor market.",
        "The same member highlighted that two factors have led to a reallocation of resources from manufacturing to services: one medium- and long-term factor, associated with a greater trade integration and specialization, and a more recent one, related to technological change and its use in the services sector.",
        "Most members indicated that the balance of risks to global growth remains biased to the downside.",
        "Among the risks that still persist the majority mentioned the escalation of trade tensions between the U.S. and its trade partners.",
        "In this respect, most members warned that the recent announcements of protectionist measures between China and the U.S. affected investors’ sentiment, thus reversing the optimism that had conveyed stability to global markets.",
        "They also considered that this could lead to a sharper economic deceleration.",
        "Most members added the following risks: i) a more prolonged weakening of some of the major economies than expected; ii) new episodes of volatility in international financial markets; and iii) the intensification of certain political and geopolitical risks.",
        "Regarding the latter, some members stressed the possibility of a disorderly Brexit process, and one of them added the tensions generated by North Korea and conflicts in the Persian Gulf.",
        "Such member warned that this could deteriorate consumer confidence, discourage investment, weaken further the lack of dynamism of global growth, increase the volatility in markets and worsen global financial conditions.",
        "In this respect, another member stated that the financial channels could magnify the economic slowdown.",
        "As to the evolution of labor markets in advanced economies, one member highlighted the high levels of job creation and the historically low levels of the unemployment gaps.",
        "In the same line, he/she emphasized the contrast between the high levels of consumer confidence and the fast deterioration of business climate observed since mid-2018.",
        "In the case of the U.S., another member argued that its anticipated deceleration reflects the fading of the fiscal stimulus and its protectionist trade policy.",
        "Some members mentioned that such policy could lead to a greater-than-anticipated deceleration.",
        "One member underlined that the probability of a recession in the U.S. taking place in the following twelve months has decreased, albeit from relatively high levels.",
        "However, the same member mentioned his/her concern about the performance of some financial indicators being similar to those observed in the months prior to past recessions.",
        "In contrast, another member noted that, although the yield curve of Treasury bonds has inverted in certain tranches, the lower term premium suggests that such performance points more to a deceleration rather than a recession.",
        "Most members highlighted the lower dynamism in emerging economies, although stating that some of these have slightly rebounded recently.",
        "One member pointed out that the tightening of global financial conditions affected to a greater extent the more vulnerable economies.",
        "Another member mentioned that economic activity in China seems to be responding favorably to the implemented stimuli and stressed that the Chinese authorities have expressed their intention to use the policy tools at their disposal to attain an orderly adjustment of their economy.",
        "However, he/she added that there is still the risk that these actions turn out to be insufficient and that shocks occur that could contribute to a greater-than-anticipated slowdown of the economy.",
        "Regarding the outlook for emerging economies, some members anticipate a decreasing growth trend.",
        "One member specified that this will be more evident in Asian economies, which already show signs of weakness after having exhibited a positive performance in early 2019.",
        "Another member stressed that emerging economies that are more open to world trade face considerable challenges to boost investment.",
        "In addition, he/she noted that in some economies, idiosyncratic factors have increased the uncertainty regarding the economic outlook and have hindered investment.",
        "Some of the downward risks for growth of emerging economies that he/she highlighted are: i) the deterioration or persistence of trade tensions; ii) that these give rise to a greater deceleration of the Chinese economy and to lower commodity prices; iii) that, with the aim of attaining quantitative targets for the bilateral deficits of larger economies, trade opportunities for other economies are restrained; and iv) that a restructuring of investment portfolios towards lowerrisk assets is observed.",
        "The same member pointed out that the environment for these economies has become more uncertain and that their performance will be determined by idiosyncratic factors and by the soundness of their macroeconomic foundations.",
        "Most members mentioned that global inflationary pressures remain at moderate levels, some of them pointing out the downward pressures associated to a lower global demand, although the majority acknowledged that increases caused by higher energy prices have also been observed.",
        "In the same vein, most members mentioned that although headline inflation has rebounded due to the above, core inflation has decreased in several economies, in some cases due to transitory factors and methodological changes.",
        "The majority clarified that in the U.S., the euro area and Japan, core inflation lies below their central banks’ targets.",
        "In this sense, one member added that in many developed countries inflation expectations for the end of 2019 have been adjusted downwards, below such targets.",
        "Most members noted that although labor markets in advanced economies continue to exhibit strength and certain wage increases, no inflationary pressures have been detected so far.",
        "One member considered that the performance of labor markets could contribute to attain their inflation targets, but he/she also stated that this is still subject to uncertainty, given the moderate increases in labor costs and the risks for global economic activity.",
        "However, he/she warned that an unexpected rebound in inflation cannot be ruled out, as a result of a greater pass-through of wage increases or of import tariffs on prices.",
        "Another member underlined that in advanced economies a number of factors have kept inflationary pressures structurally low, such as the difficulty for firms to pass on cost pressures associated with wage-related increases to goods and services’ prices.",
        "He/she pointed out that technological change and globalization have allowed the fragmentation of production processes according to the comparative advantages and to the cost structure in different countries and regions.",
        "He/she added that this has generated productivity gains and more competitive markets, making more difficult for firms to increase their prices.",
        "Finally, he/she underlined that the future performance of inflation will largely depend on the persistence or weakening of these factors, and that although inflation in advanced economies is expected to remain low, this scenario is not free of upside risks.",
        "Regarding inflation in emerging economies, one member stated that it followed a slight upward trend, but also pointed out that core inflation remained relatively stable, once the effects of the exchange rate depreciation dissipated and due to a lower global demand.",
        "All members noted that given the environment of lower inflationary pressures and of lower world economic dynamism, expectations that the central banks of the major economies will follow a more accommodative monetary policy strategy have strengthened.",
        "Nevertheless, one member underlined that the risk of monetary policy surprises cannot be ruled out.",
        "All members mentioned that in its May meeting the US Federal Reserve left the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, and reiterated its message that it would be patient in making adjustments to the range.",
        "One of them added that the Fed has also adopted a strategy that relies more on the most recent information and without a predetermined direction or bias.",
        "Another member pointed out that market variables are no longer incorporating increases in the federal funds rate in 2019.",
        "Regarding international financial markets, most members stated that the outlook of lower interest rates in advanced economies led to an easing of global financial conditions, to greater risk appetite, and to a better performance of emerging economies’ assets and currencies.",
        "One of them highlighted the gains that have been observed in the main economies’ stock indices, the decline in government and corporate bond interest rates, and the pause in the strengthening of the US dollar.",
        "Some members noted the greater capital flows to emerging economies and one pointed out that these were channeled particularly to fixed income assets and, to a lesser extent, to stock markets, reflecting the higher uncertainty about economic activity worldwide and in emerging economies.",
        "Most members pointed out that, more recently, markets were affected by the escalation of trade tensions.",
        "Some members commented that in this juncture investors sought refuge in lower risk assets, and one of them highlighted the moderation in capital flows to emerging economies, as compared to the beginning of the year, and even registering outflows of equity assets in recent weeks.",
        "The same member warned that political and geopolitical risks could aggravate global financial conditions.",
        "In this regard, another member noted that the recent negative performance of financial markets could persist or even worsen, given the resurfacing of different political and geopolitical tensions.",
        "If the above materializes, it would have an adverse effect particularly on emerging economies.",
        "In addition, he/she warned that, if upward monetary policy surprises materialize in the main advanced economies, it would surely lead to sharp adjustments in international financial markets.",
        "Nevertheless, one member pointed out that the escalating trade tensions have not reversed the improvement in global financial conditions, and that due to the above and to expectations of a continued monetary policy easing, the risks to economic activity and international markets remain biased to the downside.",
        "All members said that timely information suggests that the weak performance that the Mexican economy had been exhibiting since the previous quarter intensified during the first quarter of 2019, due to both external and domestic factors, some of which are transitory.",
        "Most members noted that, according to timely estimates, using seasonally adjusted figures, GDP contracted 0.2% during the first quarter of the year, and some members specified that such weakening was greater than anticipated.",
        "Most members indicated that transitory factors affected economic activity.",
        "In this regard, some of them mentioned the fuel distribution problems, the blocking of railways, the strikes in northern Mexico, and the delays at border crossings.",
        "Given the above, one of the members deemed that the recent growth figures are likely to overestimate the weakness of economic activity.",
        "Another member mentioned that the economic cycle measured by INEGI’s Coincident and Leading Composite Indicators System (SICCA, for its acronym in Spanish) points to an upward phase covering 119 consecutive months at the end of the first quarter of phase has been the longest in Mexican history since growth.",
        "He/she mentioned that its current stage points to a temporary stagnation, without signaling yet the beginning of a recession.",
        "Another member stated that the Coincident Indicator of INEGI’s Cyclical Indicators System (SIC, for its acronym in Spanish) has lay below its long-term trend for 7 consecutive months, registering even more prolonged negative contributions in certain indicators related to employment and economic activity.",
        "With regard to economic activity from the demand side, most members noted that manufacturing exports have decelerated.",
        "Some noted that this has been associated with the negative impact on global trade.",
        "They stressed that the decline in growth expectations of US industrial production for 2019 implies a lower dynamism of external demand for Mexico.",
        "One member warned that the slow growth of non-oil exports has taken place despite certain dynamism in the US economy and a very favorable real exchange rate.",
        "Specifically, he/she highlighted the deceleration of automotive exports.",
        "As for domestic demand, most members emphasized the persistent lack of dynamism of investment and the recent slowdown of consumption.",
        "One member noted that investment is expected to have continued decelerating after the rebound observed in January.",
        "Another member commented that a cause of concern is that private investment has remained practically stagnant since 2016 and that, since then, the cost of financing to firms has increased and the growth rate of bank lending to firms, particularly to small- and medium-size firms, has declined.",
        "The same member added that it is also worrisome that a secular slowdown in private consumption has been observed since 2016, while the growth rate of credit to households has declined considerably, which has been accompanied by a significant increase in the costs of such credits.",
        "In this regard, he/she indicated that it is no coincidence that the slowdown in consumption and the stagnation of investment have coincided with a period in which the real interest rate has increased significantly, given that, although consumption and investment respond to different determinants, interest rates are a key factor in their evolution.",
        "He/she pointed out that the above shows that the monetary policy transmission mechanism is functioning through channels that affect real variables.",
        "Another member stressed that the weakness of investment has continued for approximately four years, due to several factors, such as the fall in public investment, fundamentally explained by the strategy adopted to strengthen public finances, and an environment of persisting uncertainty.",
        "He/she specified that the stagnation of investment has not responded to the adopted monetary policy stance, since such stagnation began when the reference rate was at 3%.",
        "He/she added that recent surveys among entrepreneurs and analysts do not assign a major role to monetary policy as an explanatory factor of low growth rates.",
        "On the other hand, one member warned that, given different transitory and idiosyncratic factors, it is foreseeable that GDP components on the expenditure side will continue exhibiting negative growth rates or rates very close to zero in the first quarter.",
        "On the supply side, most members emphasized that in the first quarter of the year contractions were observed in the industrial and services components.",
        "As to industrial production, one member stressed that data up to March show a downward trend in three out of its four main components, along with a stagnation of the manufacturing industry.",
        "Another member stressed that the significant contraction in construction is a cause of concern, while another one added that the persistent fall in oil production is also worrisome.",
        "Most members noted that given the GDP figures at the beginning of 2019, growth expectations for the year have deteriorated.",
        "One member noted that growth expectations for 2019 by private sector specialists surveyed by Banco de México have been decreasing constantly for more than a year.",
        "Nevertheless, some members indicated that a recovery in the growth rate is expected starting from the second quarter.",
        "One of them pointed out that this could be driven by consumption, given the higher real wages, the real increase in credit for consumption and the increase in the purchasing power of remittances.",
        "He/she commented that positive, albeit marginal, contributions of private investment and exports are foreseen.",
        "Likewise, he/she pointed out that, in this scenario, along with the implementation of the priority programs of the new administration, a new phase of growth is likely to begin.",
        "Regarding growth expectations for 2020, another member pointed out that these have been adjusted downwards from April 2018 to April 2019.",
        "However, most members noted that in recent months such expectations have recovered somewhat.",
        "In this regard, another member mentioned that this seems to reflect an arithmetic effect, as there are no elements that lead to assume a more optimistic view.",
        "All members pointed out that the balance of risks for growth has become more uncertain and that it continues biased to the downside, as a result of external and domestic factors.",
        "Among the former, in addition to the already described global risks, most members added the possibility of obstacles in the ratification process of the trade agreement reached in North America, other actions that can affect trade in the region and the risk that the US authorities include Mexico in the list of countries subject to trade retaliations.",
        "One member considered that, if the ratification of the aforementioned agreement is delayed, the investment outlook could become more complicated.",
        "Another member added among external risks the decline in the growth rate of manufacturing production in the U.S. and the potential implications of the fall in the Purchasing Managers’ Indices in both that country and worldwide.",
        "Among domestic risk factors, most members highlighted the risk of additional reductions in oil production, which may negatively affect public revenues.",
        "One member added the uncertainty regarding the direction of public policies in different sectors, which has contributed to maintain an adverse environment for investment.",
        "Another member pointed out that greater uncertainty, apart from undermining private investment, may also curb consumption.",
        "The same member also added the following downward risks to growth: i) the possibility of a downgrading of Pemex’s credit rating, coupled with a reduction in the country’s risk rating; ii) a further delay in the implementation of the new government’s priority programs; iii) that the new government’s austerity program leads to a greater inactivity of government than anticipated; iv) that the real exchange rate appreciates and discourages non-oil exports; v) that the growth of family remittances starts to fade; and; vi) that the increase in the purchasing power driven by the recent wage increases dwindles due to the difficulty to abate inflation.",
        "As to medium-term downward risks, such member noted the possibility of a recession in the United States.",
        "Some members argued that there are upside risks to growth, such as the significant increase in consumer confidence that has persisted for several months, the increase in the total wage bill, the start of new social programs aimed at segments of the population with a high marginal propensity to consume, and a more favorable performance of remittances.",
        "One member added the following risk factors: i) a greater-thanexpected dynamism of the US economy, an early ratification of the new trade agreement in North America as well as an elimination of trade tariff and non-tariff barriers imposed by US authorities on Mexico; ii) a greater–than-expected upturn of private investment due to positive signals from the government; iii) an early start-up of the new public investment projects, coupled with a higher-thanexpected return; and iv) the possibility of a higherthan-anticipated rebound effect resulting from a low base of comparison.",
        "Most members mentioned that the economy’s slack conditions loosened towards the end of 2018 and early 2019.",
        "One member pointed out that they remain at a neutral level, while another member noted that they are expected to widen in the following quarters.",
        "One member stated that, considering the current real GDP forecasts for the next two years, it is reasonable to anticipate a negative output gap, although below the one derived from statistical estimates, given the probable decline in the country’s growth potential over the last years.",
        "Such member highlighted the paradox that, in an environment of economic weakness, there have been increases in different indicators of wage pressures, such as contractual wages, IMSS-insured workers’ wages, and unit labor costs in the manufacturing sector.",
        "He/she stated that the upward trend of the latter has become more evident since late 2018, due to wage increases being above labor productivity.",
        "The same member argued that the natural outcome of this combination of trends has been a fall in formal employment, an increase in informal labor, and a rise in the unemployment rate, which has probably been softened by the higher levels of employment in the informal sector.",
        "He/she added that, naturally, the contraction of employment has been more marked in certain regions of the country, such as the northern border zone, where greater wage adjustments have been observed, even showing a sharp contrast with the neighboring municipalities that have not been affected by such adjustments.",
        "As for the path of headline inflation, most members mentioned its decline at the beginning of the year.",
        "One member highlighted the unusually low monthly inflation in January, due to the VAT reduction in the border zone.",
        "Another member emphasized that after accumulating 44 basis points in the first three months, it was the lowest inflation for a first quarter since Mexico’s Consumer Price Index (INPC, for its acronym in Spanish) exists.",
        "Such member added that, in February, the annual inflation rate lay marginally below the upper limit of the variability range for the first time since December 2016.",
        "One member emphasized that inflation showed a clear downward trend between September and February, although it rebounded in March and April.",
        "The same member added that cumulative inflation from December to April has been the second lowest since years.",
        "Another member pointed out that core inflation, which reflects more accurately inflationary pressures, registered a higher growth during January-April of this year than in the same period of the previous year and the second highest figure in the last 5 years.",
        "All members underlined that headline inflation rose from 4.00% to 4.41% between March and April.",
        "Most members noted that the latter figure is higher than expected and one member further stated that headline inflation lay again above the upper limit of the variability range.",
        "Another member highlighted that inflation was affected by the impact of major adjustments stemming from the peso exchange rate and from significant pressures on the non-core inflation component.",
        "One member pointed out that the possibility of headline inflation turning out higher during the second quarter of the year vis-à-vis the first quarter, was expected given the change in weights from the update of the CPI’s base year adopted in mid-2018 and due to comparison base effects.",
        "Most members noted that the recent rise in headline inflation was due to increases in its two components, pointing out that the core inflation component contributed in greater measure to such an increase.",
        "As to this latter component, most members emphasized that it remains at high levels and recently rose further than expected, going from added that this was the highest annual rate in the last behavior of core inflation was due to the variation of food merchandise prices, which continues to increase, while that of services prices rebounded recently.",
        "One member explained that the prices of food merchandise, education and services other than housing and education have grown at rates near or above 5%.",
        "Most members mentioned that services prices were influenced by the calendar effect, given that the Easter holiday this year took place in April, while in 2018 it did so in March.",
        "Nevertheless, they noted that, even after eliminating this effect, services prices register an increase.",
        "One member underlined that this effect is transitory and that he/she expects that it would start to revert starting from the third quarter of the year.",
        "Another member added that services other than tourism are not registering price increases as significant, although their growth rate has not decreased either.",
        "Such member pointed out that the rise in food merchandise prices is worrisome.",
        "He/she stated that, although INEGI reported that food merchandise inflation was 4.75% in April, Coneval estimated that the cost of the basic food basket used to measure extreme poverty, increased 6% in the same period.",
        "In this regard, such member further stated that preserving the population’s purchasing power and protecting the poorest sectors of the population should be the priority.",
        "One member said that the trend of core inflation showing a weak connection between the price dynamics and the economy’s cyclical position is of concern.",
        "Another member highlighted that several measures to track trend core inflation show persistence or even an upward trend.",
        "Such member added that, given the deceleration of economic activity, no demand pressures on prices are observed at this moment and that this, in addition to the performance of the peso exchange rate, suggests that the recent path of core inflation is explained mainly by supply shocks, stemming from the indirect impact of food and energy prices, and by the behavior of wages, together with a certain degree of inertia of core inflation.",
        "One member pointed out that it is too soon to draw conclusions about the persistence of core inflation since it cannot be ruled out that it may be due to the confluence of supply shocks that will eventually fade away.",
        "As for noncore inflation, most members mentioned that it increased from 5.47% to 6.08% from March to April, partly reflecting that since the second fortnight of February 2019, the downward path in the rate of change of energy prices reverted.",
        "As for inflation expectations, most members stated that those for short- and medium-term headline inflation increased recently.",
        "Some members noted that this was due to the recent increase of headline inflation and of some of its components.",
        "Nevertheless, one member considered that inflation expectations for the end of 2019 have been decreasing after rebounding at the end of 2018, from a median of 3.90% in November to one of 3.60% in March and of 3.70% in April.",
        "Another member explained that, between February and April, the median for headline inflation expectations for 2020 remained at 3.60%.",
        "As for headline inflation expectations for the long term, most members expressed that they remained unchanged.",
        "As for core inflation expectations, most members pointed out that those for the short and medium terms increased.",
        "One member added that, between February and April, the median of such expectations for the end of 2019 and for 2020 increased from respectively.",
        "One member considered that the median of those corresponding to the end of 2019 has not changed significantly over the last months and remains relatively stable at around 3.50%.",
        "Another member warned that long-term core inflation expectations have been converging to those of headline inflation in the last years.",
        "In sum, most members stated that all inflation expectations are clearly above the 3% permanent target, with one member specifying that this situation has been observed for a long period.",
        "Some members underlined that analysts’ inflation expectations for all terms remain above those projected by Banco de México.",
        "As for information drawn from market instruments, most members pointed out that, after having followed a downward trend, the medium- and long-term inflationary risk premium recently increased and remains at high levels.",
        "One member considered that this points to a new increase of inflationary risks in the medium and long terms.",
        "Some members mentioned that the increases in headline and core inflation and the evolution of their determinants could lead to revisions to their foreseen paths.",
        "One member highlighted that the future paths have become more uncertain.",
        "Another member noted that although headline inflation is foreseen to resume a downward trend in the second half of 2019, its convergence to the 3% target is expected to be slower than anticipated, adding that this target appears to be difficult to attain during the first half of in the absence of other shocks, it is feasible to be very close to the 3% target towards the first half of have been according to or even better than what was foreseen.",
        "In this regard, such member pointed out that average annual headline inflation during the first quarter of 2019 was in line with the forecast of the last Quarterly Report.",
        "As for inflation risks, most members highlighted the possibility that the peso exchange rate comes under pressure from external or domestic factors.",
        "The majority added that inflation could be affected if additional pressures on energy prices or on agricultural and livestock product prices arise, if an escalation of protectionist and compensatory measures worldwide materializes, or in case public finances deteriorate.",
        "Moreover, most members agreed that, given the magnitude of the increases to the minimum wage, in addition to their possible direct impact, there is the risk that these bring about high wage revisions in a variety of sectors.",
        "Some members expressed that a possible source of wage pressures are the labor commitments subscribed within the framework of the United States-MexicoCanada Agreement (USMCA).",
        "Some members underlined that wage revisions in some sectors have already exceeded productivity gains, which could give rise to cost pressures and affect formal employment.",
        "Some members mentioned that available information suggests that wage revisions may be putting pressure on core inflation, mainly through prices of labor-intensive goods and services.",
        "One member considered that although based on available information it is too early to assess the lighthouse effect that minimum wage increases may have on other wages and, subsequently, on the price level, it is important to monitor the economy’s absorption capacity to ensure that such increases do not generate additional inflationary pressures.",
        "The same member stated that it is difficult to analyze this phenomenon due to the characteristics of the labor market where minimum wage increases mostly impact the low income deciles and the informal sector of the economy.",
        "He/she warned that the analysis is further complicated by the extraordinary increase in the minimum wage level in the country’s northern border zone, which could impinge upon contractual wage negotiations for firms not only at the border zone but also in the rest of the country.",
        "He/she also highlighted that the increase of tourist services prices is of concern since, due to their labor intensive nature, they are more exposed to wage increases, and that such price increases may be the result of an undesirable pass-through effect.",
        "Another member emphasized that, up to now, there is no evidence that increases in the minimum wage, both at the national level and in the border zone, have translated into significant inflationary pressures.",
        "He/she noted that, in the case of the northern border zone, where such pressures may have been greater, inflation has been even lower than in the rest of the country.",
        "Some members added the risk that the persistence shown by core inflation could lead to a greater resistance to decline of medium- and long-term inflation expectations.",
        "One member stated that the recent dynamics of core inflation implies the materialization of some of the upwards risks that had been mentioned on previous occasions.",
        "Finally, some members highlighted the risk that the widening of economic slack does not translate into lesser pressures on inflation, given the factors that have been putting upward pressure on core inflation.",
        "As for downside risks, the same members mentioned the possibility that the prices of certain goods included in the non-core subindex could register lower variations and that economic slack could widen more than expected.",
        "One member considered that, in his/her opinion, such balance is relatively stable.",
        "The same member argued that risks have decreased as compared to those at the beginning of the year, due to the fact that the improvement of global financial conditions implies lower pressures on the peso exchange rate and, eventually, on inflation, among other factors.",
        "He/she added that stable energy product prices are expected on account of the price setting policy of the new administration.",
        "Most members pointed out that, although there has been an intensification of certain downside risk factors, like the greater slack in the economy, there are other factors that could make inflation remain at high levels and, therefore, deviate from its foreseen path, given the factors that have restrained core inflation from decreasing.",
        "Thus, most members agreed that, in an environment of high uncertainty, it is deemed that the balance of risks for inflation relative to its forecasted trajectory remains biased to the upside.",
        "As for domestic financial markets, most members pointed out that the Mexican peso appreciated compared to the levels observed during the last monetary policy decision, although it has exhibited higher volatility.",
        "Some members mentioned that trading conditions in the foreign exchange market point to an orderly functioning of such market.",
        "Most members stated that Mexico’s relatively high interest rate spreads with respect to other economies have contributed to the positive performance of the peso.",
        "Regarding interest rates, the majority noted that these recently increased, mainly those for the medium and long terms, which was associated with the escalation of the trade tensions that affected international financial markets.",
        "Some members added that the higher-than-expected inflation figures also contributed to such increase.",
        "Notwithstanding the above, one member highlighted that trading conditions in the fixed income market are at adequate levels.",
        "Another member pointed out that the stock market exhibited a marginal increase during this period.",
        "Some members delved into the performance of domestic financial markets and analyzed their development throughout a longer period, particularly since the last quarter of 2018.",
        "One member argued that it is useful to divide the analysis into two periods.",
        "During the first period, from October to the first half of December 2018, the peso depreciated significantly, while interest rates on government bonds, risk premia, and the stock market index exhibited a negative performance.",
        "Such member emphasized that this was due to a generalized strengthening of the US dollar given the outlook of a further tightening of monetary policy in the United States as well as the natural higher uncertainty present at the beginning of a new federal administration, and to some controversial public policy decisions.",
        "He/she mentioned that, during the second period, extending from the second week of December 2018 to date, the Mexican peso has been one of the best performing currencies.",
        "He/she added that interest rates on government bonds and risk premia decreased, while the stock market resumed a positive trend.",
        "He/she noted that this improvement was due partly to the aforementioned international factors and also to the fact that the natural uncertainty associated with the beginning of a new federal administration has been fading as some key decisions have been taken.",
        "Among these, he/she highlighted the USMCA, the fiscal discipline included in the Economic Package for 2019, the successful negotiation with the bond holders of the New Mexico City International Airport, and the fight to deter fuel theft.",
        "He/she considered that all of these factors appear to have contributed to restore, at least partially, an environment of greater confidence and certainty.",
        "Therefore, this member noted that the risks for domestic financial markets have been decreasing.",
        "Another member pointed out that these markets have exhibited a positive performance despite the uncertainty associated with the announcement of new public policy measures.",
        "Most members agreed that risks prevail which may affect the performance of domestic financial markets, and highlighted the uncertainty regarding the external environment and the risks regarding the credit outlook of both Pemex and the overall Mexican economy.",
        "One member underlined the uncertainty and the risk factors still prevailing have domestic assets trading at a discount or with an additional risk premium relative to their behavior in the last years or with respect to their current credit ratings.",
        "The majority of the members warned that the current environment continues to pose significant mediumand long-term risks that could affect the country's macroeconomic conditions, its growth capacity and the economy’s price formation process.",
        "Most members stressed that it is particularly important, in addition to maintaining a prudent and firm monetary policy, to promote the adoption of measures to foster an environment of confidence and certainty for investment and higher productivity, and to consolidate public finances in a sustainable way.",
        "One member noted the importance of promoting the adoption of new technologies, strengthening human capital, reducing opportunity gaps and generating the necessary incentives for growth and development.",
        "In this context, the majority mentioned that it is particularly relevant that the fiscal targets of the Economic Package for 2019 are met and that strengthening the rule of law, tackling corruption and fighting insecurity are imperative.",
        "Delving deeper into public finances, one member noted that there is a growing concern about a shortfall in public revenues, due mainly to lower oil revenues.",
        "He/she warned that this problem could worsen due to the economic slowdown and to lower tax revenues derived from the support measures for Pemex.",
        "In addition, he/she stressed that during the current fiscal year, various factors could put pressure on public finances, among which the following stand out: i) expectations of lower revenues, without considering the decrease in fiscal revenues due to the support provided to Pemex; ii) the need to reduce Pemex’s expenditures; and iii) the increase in the cost of the public debt, which could even increase further during the rest of the year subject to the behavior of the sovereign risk and the inflation premium.",
        "Finally, such member warned that public spending has been reallocated in detriment of public investment, and that together with the lack of vigor of private investment, this has adverse effects not only on economic activity in the short term but also in the medium and long run by affecting productivity and the economy’s growth potential.",
        "Another member mentioned that meeting the fiscal targets implies in the short term addressing in a timely manner the pressures stemming from the developments in oil production, the measures to support Pemex, and from a lower than expected economic growth.",
        "In this regard, most members pointed out the concern about the persisting reduction in oil production, which has led to lower-than-budgeted oil revenues, leaving the federal government with less room for maneuver to implement its priority projects and meet its fiscal targets for 2019 and 2020.",
        "Delving into Pemex’s situation, most members mentioned that the federal government’s efforts to support this state-owned company, such as the recent agreements to lessen its tax burden and refinance its debt, although they point in the right direction, it is necessary to solve the company’s structural problems.",
        "Such members added that this company has structural problems and that it is essential not only that it submits a credible and functional business plan, which does not jeopardize the federal government’s fragile fiscal balance, but also that it offers a permanent solution.",
        "In this context, the majority highlighted that its credit rating is a risk factor for domestic financial markets and for the country’s economy.",
        "One member underlined that it is important that the actions that are adopted contribute to generate confidence and to anchor more effectively the outlook for the Mexican economy.",
        "Another member noted that according to experts, returns on projects involving oil exploration and production are far higher than those involving oil refining.",
        "The same member added that neither Pemex nor the federal government have the resources to make the necessary investments.",
        "He/she argued that it is also necessary to promote private investment in this sector as well as to offer legal certainty to private companies’ contracts and to improve Pemex’s corporate governance.",
        "Some members mentioned the risks associated with the decision to build the oil refinery in Dos Bocas.",
        "One member pointed out that the federal government has had to adjust public spending for 2019, which could compromise physical investment in Pemex.",
        "Finally, another member underlined that markets’ questioning regarding the institution’s solvency, the strength of public finances and their possible impact on the economy, will continue as long as Pemex does not have a business model that opens the perspective of a recovery of crude oil production and of a financially viable institution in the long run.",
        "In addition, one member highlighted that in the last years the economy and price formation have faced considerable shocks, both external and domestic, and that for this reason both fiscal and monetary policies had to be strengthened.",
        "Such member stated that having a sound macroeconomic policy contributes to an orderly adjustment of the economy and to the attainment of the inflation target, and provides the necessary room to adopt the required actions to foster greater certainty and confidence.",
        "In this regard, the same member expressed that is necessary to avoid that economic deceleration occurs with the adoption of policies that could affect the economy’s price formation, keeping inflation under pressure and above its target.",
        "All members considered that the current monetary policy stance is consistent with the convergence of inflation to its target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates.",
        "Nevertheless, most members expressed their concern about the persistence exhibited by core inflation.",
        "One member stated that the recent increase in core inflation reflects the challenges to consolidate its convergence to 3%.",
        "Another member mentioned that expectations of the US Federal Reserve adopting a more accommodative monetary policy stance relieves the pressure to synchronize Mexico’s monetary policy with that of the U.S., providing greater room for maneuver to Banco de México.",
        "Such member added that this allows the central bank to focus on its main goal of maintaining price stability and also meet its additional objectives related with financial stability, and even center its attention on how the economy positions itself in the business cycle.",
        "In this regard, such member pointed out that monetary policy can influence the business cycle only around the long-term growth trend, but it cannot influence the trend itself.",
        "He/she considered that monetary policy’s most important contribution to a country’s economic development is to guarantee price stability, which is a necessary condition for sustained economic growth, but which is far from being a sufficient condition.",
        "The majority of members agreed that the evolution of inflation expectations is an important factor to consider for monetary policy conduction.",
        "One member pointed out that despite the tight monetary policy, analysts estimate that core inflation will not decline considerably in the next two years, anticipating a path significantly above Banco de México’s forecasts.",
        "Such member mentioned that given the decline in inflation in early 2019, inflation expectations for the end of the year were adjusted downwards, and several analysts foresaw that Banco de México would start a cycle of monetary policy easing.",
        "However, just as the central bank had warned at the time, it was not clear that such downward trend could be sustained in the short term, as proven by the recent increase in inflation.",
        "Moreover, he/she also highlighted that the monetary policy stance does not depend only on the behavior of a single variable.",
        "The same member underlined that although the growth in the annual inflation rate in April should not have been surprising, most analysts did not anticipate it and ended up revising upwards their expectations for the end of 2019.",
        "He/she considered that the latter suggests that a shift towards a more accommodative message in the previous monetary policy statement would have been very premature.",
        "However, he/she emphasized that the anticipated increase in headline inflation for the second quarter of the year is a temporary phenomenon that might fade away as long as the current monetary policy stance is maintained long enough to ensure that observed inflation and its expectations converge clearly to inflation’s permanent target, as has been forecasted.",
        "One member mentioned that the increase in longterm core inflation expectations is difficult to explain in a context where inflation has been decreasing, short-term inflation expectations have remained relatively stable and the risks to inflation have diminished.",
        "In this regard, he/she argued that the tone of the monetary policy statement is an economic policy tool and that, when private agents have imperfect information on the state of the economy, they use the information provided by the central bank to update their beliefs about such state.",
        "He/she argued that the tone of the central bank’s communications may constitute a mechanism for coordinating or confirming private agents’ beliefs.",
        "He/she considered that the tone of the last three monetary policy statements has been relatively pessimistic and has highlighted the potential upward risks to inflation, which might be one of the reasons behind the recent increases in short- and long-term inflation expectations.",
        "Another member argued that the behavior of such expectations is not related with a pessimistic message by the central bank regarding the path of inflation, given that the forecasts published are based on objective criteria and, up to the last Quarterly Report, they estimated that inflation would converge to its target in the first half of 2020.",
        "Most members noted that the current environment poses a complex outlook and dilemmas for monetary policy.",
        "They argued that, although the weakening of economic activity and the widening of economic slack should mitigate inflationary pressures, there are still significant risks that could increase inflation.",
        "Some members expressed that the central bank should monitor the evolution of the economy so that the tight monetary policy does not continue for too long.",
        "One of them warned that this could generate greater economic slack, lead to an excessive appreciation of the real exchange rate and to downward pressures on export activity, and attract volatile capital flows, which, in the long run, could increase the instability and vulnerability in the foreign exchange market.",
        "He/she mentioned that, in view of a stable balance of risks for inflation, the upward cycle of interest rates should be thought of as concluded, unless extraordinary events occur.",
        "Nevertheless, he/she acknowledged that it is important for Banco de México to send a clear signal of prudence and commitment to complying with its main mandate.",
        "He/she stated that for the monetary policy decision to contribute to attain the inflation target and to maintain financial stability, the tone of the monetary policy statement should be more neutral than that of previous ones, thus contributing to anchor inflation expectations.",
        "He/she stressed that inflation has behaved accordingly to the central bank’s projections, that the inflation target is expected to be attained in the near future, and that inflation risks have diminished.",
        "Another member argued that it is key for the monetary policy statement to emphasize that, despite the weakening of economic activity, the balance of risks to inflation has deteriorated in an environment of significant domestic and external uncertainty.",
        "Most members warned about the risks of easing the monetary policy stance too early, in an environment where: i) headline and core inflation have increased; and ii) the future path of these indicators considers additional pressures and has become more uncertain.",
        "One member mentioned that this could lead to higher volatility in domestic financial markets, undo the progress achieved in granting higher real wages and even foster a less favorable macroeconomic environment for sustained economic growth.",
        "Another member pointed out that although the negative output gap forecast should contribute to ease inflationary pressures, there is the risk that supply shocks on inflation and, specifically, the trends that are being observed in wages, lead to a de-anchoring of long-term inflation expectations, especially in an environment of increases in shortterm headline inflation expectations and of a persisting upward trend in long-term core inflation expectations.",
        "He/she emphasized the risk of core inflation following an inertial behavior and also added the importance of exercising extreme caution in light of the challenges that might arise in a situation of high domestic and external uncertainty.",
        "Some members noted that under these circumstances, an easing of the monetary policy stance or a premature message in this direction would validate the above mentioned inflation expectations, would call into question the commitment to the inflation target and would affect the central bank’s credibility.",
        "One member pointed out that this could even affect economic activity negatively, as it would be reflected in upward adjustments of long-term interest rates.",
        "Some members added that the current monetary policy stance should be maintained for as long as it is required to guarantee the convergence of inflation, and one of them stressed that this is the only way for inflation expectations to begin decreasing.",
        "Most members indicated that the central bank should be prepared to respond to the extent that is required to attain such convergence and considered that, given the environment of both external and domestic uncertainty, Banco de México should maintain a firm and cautious policy stance.",
        "To guide its monetary policy actions, Banco de México’s Governing Board follows closely the development of inflation vis-à-vis its forecasted trajectory, taking into account the monetary policy stance and the time frame in which monetary policy operates as well as available information on all inflation determinants and on medium- and longterm inflation expectations, including the balance of risks for such factors.",
        "Monetary policy must respond prudently if for any reason the uncertainty faced by the economy increases considerably.",
        "Although headline and core inflation have increased, these developments are considered to be transitory and the current monetary policy stance consistent with the convergence of inflation to its target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates.",
        "For this reason, Banco de México’s Governing Board decided unanimously to leave the target for the overnight interbank interest rate unchanged at and stable inflation as well as those the economy’s price formation is subject to, the Governing Board will continue to follow closely all factors and elements of uncertainty that have an impact on both inflation and its outlook, and will take the necessary actions so that the reference rate is kept at a level consistent with the convergence of headline inflation to Banco de México’s target within the period in which monetary policy operates.",
        "Banco de México’s Governing Board will maintain a prudent monetary policy stance and, under the current environment of uncertainty, will follow closely the potential pass-through of exchange rate fluctuations to prices, Mexico’s monetary policy stance relative to that of the U.S.-in an external environment that it is still subject to risks- and the behavior of slack conditions and cost-related pressures in the economy.",
        "In the presence and possible persistence of factors that, by their nature, involve risks to both inflation and inflation expectations, monetary policy will be adjusted in a timely and firm manner to achieve the convergence of inflation to its 3% target and to strengthen the anchoring of medium- and long-term inflation expectations so that they attain such target.",
        "Alejandro Díaz de León-Carrillo, Irene EspinosaCantellano, Gerardo Esquivel-Hernández, Javier Eduardo Guzmán-Calafell and Jonathan Ernest Heath-Constable voted in favor of leaving the target for the overnight interbank interest rate unchanged at 8.25%.",
        "Against the Monetary Policy Statement (press Although I agreed with the decision to keep the target interest rate level constant, I do not agree with the press release that informs about such decision.",
        "Specifically, I differ on both the restrictive tone that characterizes it as well as the conclusion reached with respect to the balance of risks to inflation.",
        "This is based on the fact that inflation observed throughout 2019 has behaved in line with (or even more favorably) than what was expected in late monetary policy stance of several developed countries as well as the marked deceleration of Mexico’s economic activity allowed for releasing a monetary policy statement with a more neutral tone.",
        "I am particularly concerned that inflation expectations and inflation risk premia are increasing despite the relatively favorable behavior of inflation in 2019.",
        "It is not totally unlikely that such expectations are being affected by the central bank’s communication.",
        "I also differ with the emphasis given to the minimum wage increase as an upward risk to inflation.",
        "After five months of this increase, there is no convincing evidence that this is in fact occurring.",
        "All members noted that during the second quarter of the year the world economy decelerated, reflecting the lower growth of the main advanced and emerging economies.",
        "In this sense, most members added that this deceleration has been widespread and greater than anticipated.",
        "The majority mentioned that there were tensions between the U.S. and other economies, related both to trade as well as to issues associated with migration, technology and exchange rate policy.",
        "They emphasized that the areas most affected by this environment are world trade, manufacturing production, investment and business confidence, and that the outlook for growth for the world economy for 2019 and 2020 has been revised downwards once more.",
        "Most members highlighted that risks to global growth have increased and thus the balance of risks has deteriorated.",
        "The majority highlighted that among the main risks those that stand out are: i) an escalation of trade disputes; ii) a disorderly Brexit; and, iii) political and geopolitical risks.",
        "As an additional risk, one member also considered episodes of financial stress in emerging economies, while another added the possibility of a sharp slowdown of the Chinese economy.",
        "Delving into advanced economies, one member mentioned that in the United States industrial production, exports as well as imports have remained relatively stagnant since late 2018.",
        "He/she added that this has already started to be reflected in job creation, although this indicator still remains at satisfactory levels.",
        "Another member considered that economic activity in that country has started to be affected by the escalation of trade tensions, especially in manufacturing activity and in corporate investment.",
        "Some members pointed out that different indicators suggest the possibility of an economic deceleration which, in an extreme case, could become a recession.",
        "Regarding the euro area, one member indicated that GDP growth in the first semester has been lower than in previous years and that business confidence indicators and the Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) continued to worsen, highlighting the case of Germany.",
        "Most members noted the absence of widespread inflationary pressures worldwide and pointed out that this has been partly a consequence of the weakening of economic activity and of lower commodity prices, highlighting one of them, the case of energy products.",
        "Most members mentioned that as to the main advanced economies, both headline and core inflation continue to be below their respective central banks’ targets.",
        "In this regard, one member emphasized that such indicators are expected to remain below their target levels for a prolonged period.",
        "In this sense, most members added that inflation expectations remain weak and have even deteriorated in some of these economies.",
        "One member stated that differences between goods’ and services’ inflation continue to be present, with the latter sector continuing to expand, and thus strengthening the labor market.",
        "He/she added that this situation has been characterized by an absence of inflationary pressures, despite the increases observed in recent wage revisions.",
        "The same member analyzed the different factors that have kept inflation structurally low and with a lesser response to the lower labor slack in advanced economies.",
        "In this respect, he/she mentioned technological change and the incorporation of countries with an abundant labor force into globalization, arguing that this has contributed to greater productivity gains and to more competitive markets and, thus, to lower inflationary pressures.",
        "Regarding inflation in emerging economies, another member mentioned that the absence of inflationary pressures is evidenced by the downward trend followed by core inflation in these economies.",
        "All members noted that, given an environment of greater uncertainty, global economic slowdown and lower inflationary pressures –in most cases at levels below their targets– a large number of central banks have adopted more accommodative monetary policy stances.",
        "One member highlighted that some central banks have cut their reference rates in magnitudes even greater than expected and other member emphasized the major change in the direction followed by monetary policy worldwide over the last eight months.",
        "Most members mentioned that central banks in advanced economies are assessing the possibility of implementing additional non conventional measures.",
        "As for the US Federal Reserve, all members indicated that in its July meeting it cut its target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points (bps) and brought forward the end of its balance sheet reduction.",
        "One member highlighted that this occurred under conditions of greater uncertainty.",
        "Some members underlined that in its communications the US Federal Reserve made it clear that this adjustment does not imply the beginning of an easing cycle, although the possibility of future adjustments, if required, was not ruled out.",
        "One member added that market expectations continue to differ from the statements by some Federal Reserve officials, and another member emphasized that despite the strength of the economy and the labor market, the Federal Reserve cut its rates in a preventive way.",
        "In this sense, one member pointed out that markets envisage a further reduction of 50 and 25 basis points in 2019 and 2020, respectively.",
        "Meanwhile, all members mentioned that although the European Central Bank left its policy rate unchanged, it modified its forward guidance about the trajectory of interest rates towards a more accommodative policy stance and announced that it would consider additional monetary easing measures.",
        "Some members mentioned that various emerging economies have also adopted monetary policy easing measures, emphasizing the cases of Brazil, Chile, Russia, South Korea and India among a large list of countries.",
        "One member considered that the central banks of emerging economies that have not modified their interest rates, have tightened their monetary policy stances in relative terms.",
        "Another member argued that the observed cuts have generated concern among analysts regarding the beginning of a possible currency war.",
        "Most members mentioned the presence of volatility episodes in international financial markets, associated with US-China tensions and with the greater-than-anticipated deceleration of some economies.",
        "One member pointed out that risk aversion sentiment and the search for safe haven assets over the last weeks led to significant falls in stock markets, a reduction in bond yields in advanced economies, which reached historically low levels, and to a widespread appreciation of the US dollar.",
        "Another member mentioned the decrease in interest rates for all maturities, both in advanced and emerging economies.",
        "Another member stressed that, given the outlook of a greater monetary policy easing, risk premia of most countries remained unchanged or decreased.",
        "Another member mentioned that in the case of the U.S., considerable downward adjustments have been observed in the yield curve of Treasury bonds in all maturities.",
        "In addition, he/she argued that the recent performance of markets, given the escalating trade tensions, has had considerable impacts, especially across countries and regions integrated to world trade and with episodes of volatility in emerging markets.",
        "As to capital flows to these economies, some members emphasized that, although investment flows to their debt markets continue registering inflows, stock markets have been accumulating outflows for 16 consecutive weeks.",
        "One member stressed the negative implications of outflows from the equity market for the valuation of currencies and other assets of these economies.",
        "Most members pointed out that risks that could affect global financial markets persist.",
        "In addition to the risks to global growth mentioned above, one member highlighted the possibility of periods of political instability in Italy, and other countries.",
        "In this regard, another member stressed that, given the intensification or materialization of some of these risks, the main economies’ central banks may be expected to take action to improve global financial conditions, just as it has happened during 2019.",
        "Therefore, he/she considered that, despite the global uncertainty, the balance of risks for global financial markets remains stable.",
        "In contrast, another member indicated that the foreseen scenario of a greater loosening in financing conditions implies the risk of monetary stimulus measures being of a lesser magnitude than anticipated or insufficient to contain a greater-than-expected deceleration of economic activity.",
        "He/she also mentioned the greater challenges to financial stability that could result from a longer period of global monetary policy easing.",
        "As for emerging economies, one member indicated that these are also subject to different idiosyncratic risk factors and that, in some cases, for example in Mexico, such factors have reinforced the impact of the lower growth trend worldwide, as well as the uncertainty that has hindered investment.",
        "He/she pointed out that the current environment affects these economies in two ways.",
        "On the one hand, he/she mentioned the slowdown of world trade and lower commodity prices, which imply a deterioration in the terms of trade and give rise to lower economic growth and lower inflationary pressures.",
        "On the other hand, he/she stated that such economies can be affected by episodes of portfolio rebalancing towards lower-risk assets, thus putting pressure on their currencies, risk premia and interest rates.",
        "As a consequence, the environment they face is complex and uncertain.",
        "All members mentioned that the latest information suggests that during the second quarter of 2019, the stagnation that economic activity in Mexico had been showing in the previous quarters continued.",
        "One member specified that the GDP flash estimate for this quarter registered its first negative annual rate since late 2009 and that the average quarterly rate of the last five quarters is 0.04%.",
        "Some members specified that the deceleration was greater than anticipated.",
        "One member pointed out that it was greater than that suggested by the weak global economy and another member added that it is worrisome that this has taken place in a context where the US economy is growing above potential.",
        "One member mentioned that timely indicators suggest the possibility of a downward revision to the quarterly growth figures for the second quarter of the year.",
        "He/she stressed the weakening of the economic cycle, given that different indicators estimated by INEGI, such as the Coincident and Leading Composite Indicators System (SICCA, for its acronym in Spanish) and the Coincident Indicator of the Cyclical Indicators System (SIC, for its acronym in Spanish) reached their lowest level in May 2019, and noted that this weakening applies to most components of these indicators, which is consistent with a situation of recession.",
        "He/she added that during the last nine months the negative gap widened with respect to its long-term trend, which is also consistent with of the existence of a recession.",
        "All members emphasized that stagnation of economic activity reflects a greater weakness in most components of aggregate demand, standing out among those the slowdown of consumption and lackluster investment.",
        "In the same vein, one member mentioned the delays in government spending.",
        "Regarding the weakness of consumption, another member highlighted that the average annual percentage change has been 4.3% in 2016, 3.1% in corresponding to May 2019 was 0%.",
        "He/she specified that consumption of durable goods already registers negative annual changes.",
        "Another member added that the trend-cycle measure of the private consumption index seems to have reached an inflection point at the end of the previous year, without reversing its downward trend since then.",
        "Another indicated that this weakness has taken place despite the fact that remittances and the wage bill continue growing.",
        "As to investment, most members mentioned that both public and private investment continue to exhibit a downward trajectory.",
        "One member specified that its different components show clear negative trends since mid2018.",
        "In this respect, most members highlighted the sharp fall in construction and mentioned the decline in purchases of imported machinery and equipment.",
        "One of them pointed out that, with seasonally adjusted data, investment in construction is at levels unseen since early 2006.",
        "Regarding external demand, most members stated that manufacturing exports performed better in the second quarter of the year, as compared to the previous one.",
        "One member pointed out that this is explained by the dynamism of the US economy and another member stated that this is taking place despite the slowdown of world trade.",
        "From a medium-term perspective, one member mentioned his/her concern over the secular slowdown in the growth rate of private consumption that has been observed since 2016.",
        "In the same way, he/she indicated that private investment has remained stagnant during the same period and that in the last months it is already following a negative trend.",
        "He/she indicated that the cost of financing to households and firms has been growing constantly since 2016 and that the growth rate of credit granted by commercial banks has declined since then.",
        "He/she pointed out that, although consumption and investment respond to different factors, interest rates are a key factor in their evolution.",
        "The same member considered that this shows that the transmission mechanism of a tight monetary policy implies costs and that the risks associated with maintaining a high interest rate for a long period should not be minimized.",
        "Another member expressed that the evolution of investment is a reason for concern.",
        "He/she pointed out that after having been stagnant from mid-2015 to mid-2018, investment is increasingly showing a marked downward trend, recently reaching levels similar to those observed in July 2014.",
        "He/she added that this performance, which affects potential growth, partly derives from the strong decline in public investment.",
        "He/she added that private investment has been curbed by the high uncertainty prevailing in the country, due partly to external factors, but apparently, to a greater extent, to the insufficient clarity of certain public policies and a domestic environment that is generally perceived as unfavorable for investment.",
        "In this respect, he/she noted that over three quarters of private sector analysts surveyed by Banco de México consider that the current juncture is not favorable for investment, and that the main obstacles to growth are attributed to domestic economic conditions, as well as to governance problems, some of which are the uncertainty over the political situation, and the problems of public insecurity and absence of rule of law.",
        "He/she added that, in contrast, the relevance given by analysts to monetary policy is much lower.",
        "On the supply side, most members mentioned the weakness of the industrial and services’ sectors.",
        "One member emphasized that the Global Economic Activity Indicator (IGAE, for its acronym in Spanish) shows that deceleration is already present in all sectors.",
        "Delving into industrial activity, he/she indicated that it shows a negative trend since mid2018, which already allows for speaking of a recession in this sector.",
        "Some members emphasized the contraction of primary activities, while one member pointed out that construction has fallen more rapidly in the last months.",
        "All members mentioned that growth expectations for this year have been adjusted to the downside.",
        "Some members highlighted that the median of analysts’ expectations has declined and that in most recent surveys it lies at 0.6%.",
        "On the other hand, most members indicated that it is possible to estimate that GDP growth in 2019 will lie with a high probability in a range below the one foreseen in the Quarterly Report January – March 2019.",
        "Regarding growth expectations for 2020, some members noted that these have also been adjusted to the downside.",
        "One of them specified that the most optimistic scenario now points to growth below 2%.",
        "One member mentioned that timely information allows to anticipate that investment will continue declining.",
        "Another member noted that indicators of demand for money for transactional purposes, along with the slope of the yield curve, suggest that the probability of economic contraction in the next two quarters has reached levels similar to those observed during previous episodes of significant falls in output.",
        "All members indicated that, in an environment of significant uncertainty, the balance of risks for growth remains biased to the downside.",
        "One member indicated that this bias has increased with respect to previous decisions.",
        "Some members pointed out that growth is subject to both external and domestic risks.",
        "Among external risks, in addition to the global risks previously described, some members mentioned the possibility of delays in the ratification of USMCA.",
        "One of them added the risk of new US threats to impose tariffs on Mexico or complications in the bilateral relationship between these two countries.",
        "Another member mentioned the risk of a deceleration in the U.S. in the next years and noted that this scenario stresses the urgency to correct the domestic factors that inhibit growth.",
        "As for domestic risks, most members highlighted the persistence of an environment of uncertainty that has affected private investment, and which has stemmed from the public policy decisions taken by the new administration and by concerns over insecurity and corruption.",
        "Another member highlighted a greater reduction of public revenues.",
        "Finally, one member emphasized the risk of maintaining an overly restrictive monetary policy stance.",
        "Most members mentioned that slack conditions in the economy continued to loosen, even more than anticipated, thus the negative output gap widened.",
        "As to the labor market, one member argued that it has presented a lower rate of job creation, thus the unemployment gaps have eased somewhat with respect to the levels reached in 2018.",
        "In this regard, another member noted that sluggish economic activity has been reflected in the behavior of the labor market and, more clearly, in formal employment.",
        "This member mentioned that, although the number of IMSS-insured workers has increased over the last year, the increment with respect to the previous year went down by over 40% between July unemployment rate has increased moderately, albeit accompanied by greater informal employment and by increases in the underemployment rate.",
        "He/she added that, despite the weakening of the labor market, the most recent indicators continue showing adjustments in earnings above productivity, which could be impacting employment.",
        "He/she specified that the impact on formal employment has been particularly large in the Northern border free zone, where the minimum wage increased considerably.",
        "Finally, he/she stated that the downward adjustment in growth expectations for 2019 and 2020 strengthens expectations that during this period a negative output gap will continue to be observed, albeit lower than estimated, considering the probable decline of potential growth.",
        "Meanwhile, another member noted that the risk of a widening of economic slack conditions persists.",
        "Most members mentioned that between June and July, headline inflation fell from 3.95% to 3.78%.",
        "The majority indicated that this evolution was due mainly to a decline in the non-core component, since the core component has continued to exhibit persistence.",
        "One member noted that annual inflation has been showing a clear downward trend since September 2018 and that since then it has declined over 120 basis points.",
        "Such member argued that an indicator showing that inflation is not only decreasing, but also that the price formation process has remained under control, is that headline inflation accumulated so far this year is only 0.65%, the third lowest figure for a similar period this century.",
        "He/she stated that the trajectory of has been better than forecasted in previous months both by the Central Bank and by analysts.",
        "He/she added that in the latter case, in December they expected accumulated headline inflation as of July to amount to 1.19%.",
        "Nevertheless, it has been barely above half that figure.",
        "He/she stressed that despite that, analysts adjusted their inflation expectations to the upside and currently expect inflation to close the year at inflation expectations remained at the level they had in December, their expected inflation for the end of upward adjustment of inflation expectations is surprising, given that inflation has been below expectations and various inflationary risks have decreased.",
        "As for the non-core component, most members stressed that it declined from 4.19% in June to 3.64% in July.",
        "They added that this dynamics especially reflected the lower increases in energy prices, as well as in fruits and vegetable prices, while the growth rate of livestock products’ prices rose at the margin.",
        "One member highlighted that non-core inflation accumulated during the first seven months of the year was -3.82%, the lowest figure in the last that it has remained persistent around 3.8%.",
        "In this context, some members emphasized that it has remained at relatively high levels.",
        "They added that it should be acknowledged that it still does not show a trajectory visibly converging to the 3% target.",
        "In this respect, one of them mentioned that its persistence in the last 16 months is noteworthy, considering the weakening of economic activity and the evolution of the exchange rate, which, although having undergone fluctuations, has slightly depreciated during that period.",
        "In this regard, some members agreed that its evolution seems to be determined by supply shocks, driven by the behavior of wages, food prices, and, until recently, energy prices.",
        "One of them highlighted that in the last two Quarterly Reports, average core inflation forecasts for the third quarter of 2019 were 3.4 and 3.6%, respectively, and that for July, the data came in at 3.82%, having remained around that level for a long period.",
        "Finally, another member noted that core and non-core inflation are already within the variability interval of plus/minus one percentage point around 3%.",
        "Most members mentioned that inflation expectations at different terms drawn from surveys and financial markets have remained relatively stable, although at levels above the 3% target.",
        "In this regard, one member highlighted that this is observed for both headline and core inflation and despite a significant downward adjustment of economic growth forecasts.",
        "He/she added that breakeven inflation drawn form market instruments has decreased, although it continues to suggest the persistence of upward risks for medium- and long-term inflation.",
        "In this regard, another member pointed out that exogenous factors that impact the non-core component, which will probably pick up to their historic averages, might explain why the inflation risk premium is still at relatively high levels.",
        "One member noted that it cannot be ruled out that the pessimistic tone of recent communiqués may be one the reasons behind the recent increase in inflation expectations.",
        "Most members noted that, Banco de México’s baseline scenario for headline inflation may improve to some degree, mainly due to lower pressures on non-core inflation.",
        "One member stated that, despite the volatility of the latter, given the world economic deceleration there are likely to be lower pressures on the prices of energy products and, consequently, on non-core inflation.",
        "As for the outlook for core inflation, the majority of members noted that it is expected to start decreasing given the dissipation of the shock arising from energy product prices.",
        "One member explained that, in contrast to what happened in 2017 and 2018, such prices are no longer a key factor in light of the government’s new price policy and the decrease of international oil prices observed in recent months.",
        "Most members highlighted that the downward trend of core inflation would be influenced by the greater slack in the economy.",
        "One member mentioned that the dissipation of shocks on the relative prices of food products would also contribute to lower core inflation.",
        "Another member added that such subindex will also be influenced by the effects of wages, which have a lagged impact.",
        "In this regard, one member argued that the effect of wage pressures is conditioned to firms’ profit margins and to each market’s intrinsic features.",
        "He/she stated that, the greater the slack in the economy and the stronger the competition in each sector, the lower the possibilities of a firm passing through its labor cost increases to consumer prices and that, so far, evidence reveals that contagion has been limited and that these pressures are starting to fade.",
        "One member considered that core inflation is expected to remain on a downward trend towards the 3% target within the forecast horizon.",
        "Another member expressed that, in his/her opinion, the outlook for headline and core inflation implies small upward adjustments to both of their future trajectories, although it does not modify them significantly.",
        "Some members mentioned that headline inflation will probably be at levels relatively close to the 3% target towards the end of the year.",
        "One member pointed out that, although it is still the case that headline inflation is expected to converge to the target, in a context of core inflation under control, this scenario would materialize if non-core inflation remains below its long-term average, and the peso exchange rate shows a relatively favorable behavior.",
        "Nevertheless, one of the members emphasized that there is the risk of meeting the target in a non-optimal way, that is, on the basis of a significant decline in non-core inflation, which is the most volatile one, and persistence of the core component, which, in his/her opinion, is the most relevant one.",
        "As to upside risks for inflation, the majority of members mentioned the possibility of core inflation continuing to show persistence.",
        "One member pointed out that it is worrisome that the growth rates of both food merchandise and services prices remain at levels close to 4% and that, in some subcategories, such as services other than housing and education, they lie at around 5%.",
        "He/she added that, despite the greater slack in the economy, core inflation may remain at high levels.",
        "Most members noted the risk of the peso exchange rate coming under pressure stemming from external or domestic factors.",
        "In this regard, some members mentioned the possibility of volatility episodes putting pressure on the peso exchange rate, due to events such as a downgrading of the sovereign rating and Pemex’s loss of investment grade status by a second rating agency, as well as a deterioration of Mexico’s relationships with its North American trade partners.",
        "One member added that the risk of the peso depreciating is partly associated with investors’ concerns regarding several public policies.",
        "Another member considered that the risk of greater inflation due to a depreciation of the exchange rate is bounded.",
        "He/she argued that the pass-through of exchange rate fluctuations to prices is relatively low, noting that it is practically insignificant for economies with inflation-targeting regimes, an independent central bank, and a flexible exchange rate regime.",
        "Most members mentioned as an upside risk the threat by the United States to impose tariffs on Mexican imports and the adoption of compensatory measures, although they considered that this risk has dissipated somewhat.",
        "The majority of members added the risk that energy prices revert their trend or that agricultural and livestock product prices increase.",
        "One member pointed out the possibility of non-core inflation registering a reversion to its historical values, which are significantly higher than the current ones.",
        "Another member highlighted that it is also important to consider that such component is volatile.",
        "Most members mentioned as a risk weak public finances.",
        "In particular, one member explained that these may suffer pressures stemming from the development of economic activity, Pemex´s situation and international oil prices, among other factors.",
        "The majority of members mentioned as a risk that, given the magnitude of various wage revisions, costrelated pressures arise, insofar as such revisions exceed productivity gains.",
        "In this regard, one member considered that available evidence so far points to a very insignificant impact of minimum wage increases on inflation and that this is evidenced by both the inflation observed at the border zone, which is far below the national average, as well as the headline inflation in the rest of the country so far this year.",
        "Finally, some members also added the escalation of protectionist measures worldwide.",
        "As to downside risks, most members mentioned the possibility that the peso exchange rate may appreciate due to the greater financial slack worldwide, or in case greater certainty arises regarding the trade relation with the United States.",
        "The majority noted that lower rates of change in the prices of certain goods included in the non-core subindex, as observed in the case of energy goods due to the greater weakness exhibited by the world economy, would also contribute to reduce core inflation.",
        "The majority of members added the possibility that slack conditions widen more than anticipated, which would have an impact on the behavior of core inflation.",
        "In this context, most members agreed that high uncertainty continues to persist regarding the risks that might affect inflation.",
        "One member noted that risks have decreased substantially as compared to those present in December 2018, due to a significant improvement of global financial conditions, to the decrease in international commodity prices, and to the expectation that prices of energy products in Mexico will remain stable.",
        "He/she added that slack conditions have increased drastically and considered that the balance of risks for growth is strongly biased to the downside.",
        "Another member pointed out that in his/her opinion, the balance of risks for inflation is now slightly tilted to the downside, particularly in regards to the expected trajectory within the time frame in which monetary policy operates.",
        "One member considered that, despite the recent reduction of headline inflation and its forecasts, high risks and a considerable degree of uncertainty persist, which makes it difficult to establish the balance of risks.",
        "Another member expressed that the balance of risks for inflation continues biased to the upside, although this has occurred in an environment where there is greater uncertainty as to the pressures in different directions that will be exerted on inflation by its determinants, in particular, the peso exchange rate and the country’s economic activity.",
        "Another member underlined the persistence of a high degree of uncertainty about inflation risks.",
        "He/she highlighted the greater importance that the widening of the slack in the economy has gained as a downside risk and, as an upside risk, the possible presence of some risk factors that would affect domestic financial markets and the peso exchange rate, such as the imposition of tariffs or the downgrading of credit ratings.",
        "Most members highlighted that domestic financial markets have reflected the effects of both lower interest rates for all terms in the major advanced economies and episodes of volatility, thus stressing that, while the peso exchange rate fluctuated during these episodes, interest rates on government securities have decreased, including longer term ones.",
        "The majority noted that this behavior is in line with that observed in other emerging markets.",
        "Delving into interest rates, the majority of members highlighted that the yield curve in Mexico is inverted and that such inversion has increased.",
        "In this regard, some members emphasized that this contrasts with what is observed for most advanced and emerging economies where the yield curve has a positive slope.",
        "One member argued that the inversion of the yield curve reflects concerns about the economic deceleration.",
        "Another member added that interest rates of government bonds are at their lowest levels of the year, with the decline in ten-year yields standing out.",
        "In this regard, one member considered that it is important to analyze the yield curve behavior.",
        "Such member pointed out that long-term interest rates can be decomposed into: i) short-term interest rate expectations, which are associated with the monetary policy stance, which, in turn, is related to the economy’s cyclical position and to other inflationary pressures; and, ii) a term premium that rewards investors for inflationary, duration and liquidity risks, among others.",
        "The same member noted that nominal and real yield curves are currently inverted vis-à-vis the overnight interbank rate, underlining that both the component of short-term interest rate expectations and the term premium have exhibited significant reductions over the last months.",
        "As to the peso exchange rate, another member stated that it has appreciated vis-à-vis the levels observed at the end of 2018, in contrast with the depreciation registered by most currencies of emerging economies.",
        "He/she attributed this behavior to both the tight monetary policy stance as well as other domestic factors, among which the fulfillment so far of fiscal commitments by the current administration stands out.",
        "In this regard, one member highlighted that the peso exchange rate has exhibited volatility associated with episodes of escalation of trade tensions, different idiosyncratic factors, and even contagion from other emerging economies, such as China and Argentina.",
        "Another member noted that the Mexican peso depreciated since Banco de México’s last monetary policy decision, in line with the evolution observed in other emerging currencies, despite Mexico’s favorable interest rate spread.",
        "Most members mentioned the deterioration of credit risk premia, while some added the higher domestic financial market stress.",
        "One member pointed out that the indicators of Pemex’s credit risk are showing a higher risk premium, due to the strong deterioration of its fundamentals.",
        "As to the stock market, the majority of members stated that it fell significantly.",
        "One member argued that among the determinants of the performance of such market, interest rates offered by short-term fixed income instruments should be considered, since they are an alternative to riskier equity instruments.",
        "Some members mentioned that the fall observed in the stock market was due to lower economic activity and to local uncertainty factors.",
        "One member underlined that the accumulated flow in equity instruments from foreign investors remains positive during the year, while such flow is practically null in the case of government instruments.",
        "Furthermore, another member pointed out that there was a marginal outflow in the positions of the external sector in government securities, despite the wide relative monetary stance and the maturity restructuring towards long-term positions.",
        "Regarding the risks that may affect the performance of financial assets in Mexico, all members mentioned that uncertainty persists with respect to the credit rating outlook for both Pemex’s debt and Mexico’s sovereign debt.",
        "Most members also pointed out the uncertainty regarding the bilateral relationship between Mexico and the United States.",
        "With regards to the risk of credit rating revisions, one member argued that, despite the fact that several instruments already include such revisions, their materialization may increase markets’ volatility and reduce the financing capacity of the economy.",
        "In this regard, another member stated that it is important to address the factors that gave rise to such revisions, avoid an additional downgrading of credit ratings, and seek to improve the current ratings in order to contribute to an orderly adjustment of domestic financial markets and to preserve the elements that allow them to remain as an attractive investment destination.",
        "Finally, one member considered that the measures taken by several central banks of the major economies mitigate the external risks.",
        "He/she added that, in his/her opinion, several domestic risks associated with public policies have faded away throughout the year.",
        "Most members agreed that Pemex’s situation is still a risk factor.",
        "They stated that Pemex’s business plan announced in mid-July has failed to reestablish confidence in its financial outlook due to doubts regarding the viability of increasing crude oil production.",
        "One member added the impossibility to reach adequate oil reserve replacement levels as set out in the plan.",
        "Another member mentioned that such rescue program demands, in the short- and mediumterms, the continued and essential support of the federal government, which is in an overly constrained fiscal position.",
        "He/she considered that it would be desirable to resume bidding rounds with public-private partnerships, as well as oil auctions.",
        "He/she also highlighted that analysts have stated that the proposed business plan does not include an explicit strategic plan that considers the international oil demand environment within the framework of the foreseen economic deceleration nor the increasing use of renewable energies.",
        "Most members pointed out that the increase of Pemex’s default premia observed in previous months has not reversed and that markets continue to discount an additional downgrading of Pemex’s credit rating.",
        "One member added that the above may generate forced sales of Pemex’s debt and, in general, turmoil in domestic financial markets.",
        "The majority of members considered that Pemex’s situation may affect public finances and Mexico’s sovereign debt rating.",
        "Nevertheless, another member argued that the indirect impact on the financial cost of the sovereign debt has been limited so far.",
        "He/she added that, although it cannot be ruled out that Pemex may lose its investment grade relatively soon, this should not necessarily give rise to disorderly adjustments in markets, taking into account that an important segment of the market already discounts this possibility.",
        "Most members mentioned that the current environment continues to pose significant mediumand long-term risks that could affect the country’s macroeconomic conditions, its capacity to grow, and the economy’s price formation process.",
        "In this regard, they highlighted that, in addition to a prudent and firm monetary policy, it is particularly important to adopt measures that foster an environment of confidence and certainty for investment and higher productivity, and that public finances are consolidated in a sustainable manner.",
        "In this context, they noted that addressing the deterioration of both the sovereign’s and Pemex’s credit ratings and achieving the fiscal targets for 2019 is necessary, and added that it is also important that the Economic Package for 2020 generates confidence.",
        "The majority of members stated that strengthening the rule of law, tackling corruption, and fighting insecurity are equally imperative.",
        "Finally, one member pointed out the need to increase productivity through the adoption of new technologies and the strengthening of human capital.",
        "Most members warned that the perception of weak public finances persists.",
        "In particular, one member underlined that, to date, budgetary revenues fall short with respect to the programmed and that this situation may worsen in the following three years due to the financial support granted to Pemex, which will imply a reduction of fiscal revenues, while at the same time oil revenues might also be lower.",
        "Most members highlighted that the aforementioned may represent a challenge for public finances given that the shortfalls in resources will need to be offset with expenditure cuts, greater capacity to raise revenue, and, in 2019, with the use of resources from the Budgetary Revenues Stabilization Fund (FEIP, for its acronym in Spanish).",
        "Some members mentioned that the authorities recently announced a set of measures aimed at boosting economic activity.",
        "One member noted that these measures do not necessarily involve injecting additional resources to the economy, while another member emphasized that, although such measures may help to improve the situation, it is essential that fiscal policy fulfills the goals announced for the primary balance.",
        "He/she pointed out that if doubts regarding the strength of public finances worsen there would be greater uncertainty, with a negative impact on economic activity.",
        "As for the use of part of the resources of the FEIP, some members considered that it is important to keep in mind the challenges arising from this decision in an environment characterized by significant risks.",
        "Such members warned about the weakness of investors’ confidence on the Mexican economy.",
        "One member noted that among other decisions of the new administration that have contributed to this situation are the cancellation of the New Mexico City International Airport (NAIM, for its acronym in Spanish), the suspension of bidding rounds with public-private partnership, and the beginning of international arbitration processes related with gas pipelines.",
        "Such measures, in addition to public insecurity and the absence of rule of law, reduce the country’s level of competitiveness and undermine the legal certainty to the trade relations between Mexico and its trading partners in North America, which could contribute to the delay in the ratification and implementation of the USMCA.",
        "Another member highlighted that, although the complicated external environment has affected the performance of emerging economies overall, it is important to consider that the perception of risk in the case of Mexico has been greater, in general, thus reflecting the simultaneous effect of idiosyncratic factors.",
        "In this regard, he/she underlined the weakening of some indicators, such as: i) the Credit Default Swap (CDS) premium, which has been more unfavorable in Mexico than in other emerging economies with similar or even lower credit ratings; and, ii) the Mexican Stock Exchange index expressed in US dollars, which from mid-2018 to date has exhibited one of the worst performances among this group of economies.",
        "Such member added that during the last months, the main rating agencies have downgraded the sovereign debt credit rating or its outlook.",
        "As for Mexico’s monetary policy, most members stated that, considering that headline inflation has decreased as foreseen by Banco de México, that slack conditions in the economy have widened more than expected, and the recent behavior of external and domestic yield curves, lowering the target for Mexico’s overnight interbank interest rate by 25 basis points to 8% is appropriate.",
        "The majority considered that this adjustment is consistent with the convergence of headline inflation to the 3% target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates.",
        "One member added that the fact that the risks faced by the economy have not increased recently provides margin to lower the policy rate.",
        "He/she noted that, since May 2017, policy rate adjustments in Mexico have been synchronized with those carried out by the US Federal Reserve, in such a way as to keeping a spread in Mexican and US rates of around the tightest relative monetary policy stance since early 2008.",
        "The same member added that such monetary policy stance was restrictive enough to fight the inflation increase observed during 20172018 and the risks that inflation faced.",
        "He/she considered that, given the latest conditions regarding the path of inflation, economic growth, and financial stability risks, widening this spread cannot be justified.",
        "He/she added that, considering the recent cut in interest rates by the US Federal Reserve, the interest rate spread between both countries has widened to 600 basis points, thus intensifying Mexico’s monetary policy restrictive stance relative to that of the United States.",
        "Such member stated that, in real terms, the policy rate is at its highest levels in eleven years, adding that this level, in a moment in which the economy is close to a recession and headline inflation being below the upper limit of the variability interval and with a trajectory of convergence to the 3% target, reflects that the current monetary policy stance is highly restrictive, not only in relation to other economies but also in absolute terms.",
        "He/she pointed out that one of the reasons why Banco de Mexico has maintained a tight policy stance is that it has sought to keep a prudent and cautious stance given the many external and domestic risks the Mexican economy has faced.",
        "He/she mentioned that, despite the above, the Governing Board should also take into account in its decision-making the effects of the behavior of economic activity.",
        "He/she emphasized that, for Banco de México it is extremely important to seek price stability, and that this is monetary policy’s best contribution to the country’s development given its limitations to stimulate the potential growth of the economy.",
        "However, he/she acknowledged that, at a time when the economy is on the edge of a recession, maintaining a tight policy stance for a long time is not advisable.",
        "Such member added that, in other words, this Central Bank will continue to procure the stability of the peso’s purchasing power, but not at any price.",
        "Another member emphasized that for various reasons both monetary and fiscal policy face important limitations to stimulate the economy under current circumstances.",
        "He/she pointed out that to reach such objective it is necessary to tackle the fundamental causes of the current weakness, that is, a situation of uncertainty and insufficient clarity of public policies in diverse areas, which does not generate appropriate conditions for investment, in addition to actions that directly hinder private investment.",
        "One member considered that the most important risk for domestic financial markets nowadays is maintaining an overly tight monetary policy stance.",
        "He/she argued that, although high interest rates are typically considered to contribute to an environment of greater stability, keeping interest rates high for a long period could contribute to generate unbalances and may have a negative effect on markets.",
        "As an example of the above, such member mentioned the negative slope that Mexico’s yield curve currently registers, as a result of short-term interest rates being highly sensitive to adjustments to the policy rate.",
        "In this regard, he/she compared the recent experience of Colombia and Mexico, stating that both countries share a similar target and have similar levels of inflation and have kept their policy rates unchanged in 2019; however, in Colombia the policy rate is lower and lies at 4.25%, while its economy is expanding at higher rates of around 3%, which indicates that Mexico’s monetary policy stance is highly restrictive.",
        "One member argued that, although several advanced and emerging economies have eased their monetary policies, in contrast to what can be observed for Mexico, in almost all of these countries inflation lies at levels close to or even below the target.",
        "This same member stated that the policy rate should be left unchanged, arguing that: i) although the 3% inflation target refers to the behavior of headline inflation; given the volatility of the non-core component, to accurately assess inflationary pressures on the economy as well as the sustainability of the trajectory of inflation, it is essential that at the same time the behavior of the core component be analyzed carefully; ii) despite the significant downward adjustment of economic growth forecasts, both headline and core inflation expectations for all terms remain above Banco de México’s expectations and the 3% target, highlighting that the latter is a point target rather than a +/- 1% interval around such figure; iii) the lack of credibility of Banco de México’s inflation forecasts, stemming partly from core inflation remaining above projections; iv) the positive effect on the peso exchange rate of the widening interest rate spread between Mexico and the United States was more than offset by several domestic and external economic and political shocks; v) uncertainty persists as to different aspects of public policies and the deterioration of economic fundamentals, which has been reflected in a higher country risk perception and demand a cautious stance; vi) more information is needed on the main elements of the fiscal policy for 2020, as it is an essential input for monetary policy implementation.",
        "He/she considered that, under an environment of uncertainty as the current one, prioritizing the trustworthiness of Banco de México’s messages is of paramount importance since, under the above mentioned circumstances, the potential for confusion and for adverse effects generated by surprises in the implementation of monetary policy increases.",
        "Nevertheless, the same member noted that monetary policy’s margins for maneuver may widen in the short term if, as expected, headline inflation continues to decrease and core inflation starts to follow a downward trend in the next weeks, a solid fiscal package is announced for 2020, and if no significant shocks occur.",
        "One member pointed out that, on this occasion, the monetary policy statement plays a particularly crucial role since the policy rate had not been lowered in five years and a wide segment of the market was not anticipating a downward adjustment in this decision, thus an adequate message is important to avoid generating uncertainty and affecting monetary policy’s effectiveness.",
        "He/she added that this requires caution and acting with prudence.",
        "Likewise, such member pointed out that this monetary policy action must not be interpreted as the start of an easing cycle, since future monetary policy decisions will depend on the development of inflation vis-à-vis its forecasted trajectory.",
        "Another member mentioned that a decrease in the policy rate together with an adequate message by Banco de México may send a signal of certainty and confidence.",
        "Such member added that this is possible if the monetary policy statement highlights the substantial reduction of inflationary risks throughout the year, the betterthan-expected behavior of inflation, and that inflation is expected to converge to the target.",
        "This would confirm that inflation is controlled, which allows for monetary policy easing in order to attain the convergence of inflation to its target in an effective way with the lowest costs for economic activity.",
        "One member stated that, even after considering this downward adjustment in the reference rate, the monetary policy stance in both relative and absolute terms remains restrictive, and an analysis of the underlying risk factors leads to the conclusion that an accommodative cycle should begin.",
        "One member mentioned that the widening slack conditions in the economy, along with an external environment where the outlook of lower interest rates and lackluster growth expectations has been taking hold, points to an environment of lower inflationary pressures within the time frame in which monetary policy operates.",
        "He/she added that, nevertheless, there are other elements that continue to influence Mexico’s economy and price formation process and have contributed to make core inflation remain above the 3% target and to show resistance to decline, and that this situation suggests that Banco de México should act gradually and follow closely the available information on the economy’s cyclical position, and on all inflation determinants as well as on their balance of risks.",
        "Most members highlighted that in the foreseeable future all factors and elements that have an impact on both inflation and its outlook should be followed, and the necessary actions be taken, so that the policy rate is consistent with the orderly convergence of headline inflation to Banco de México’s target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates.",
        "To guide its monetary policy actions, Banco de México’s Governing Board follows closely the development of inflation vis-à-vis its forecasted trajectory, taking into account the monetary policy stance and the time frame in which monetary policy operates.",
        "In this process, it uses available information on all inflation determinants as well as on medium- and long-term inflation expectations, including the balance of risks for such factors.",
        "Monetary policy must also respond prudently if for any reason the uncertainty faced by the economy increases significantly.",
        "In this context, considering that headline inflation has decreased as foreseen by Banco de México, the greater than expected widening in the amount of slack in the economy, and the recent behavior of the external and domestic yield curves at various terms, Banco de México’s Governing Board decided by majority to lower the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 25 basis points to 8.00%, considering that under the current environment such level is consistent with the convergence of headline inflation to the central bank’s target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates.",
        "One member voted to maintain the target at 8.25%.",
        "In order to consolidate a low and stable inflation, in an environment in which price formation and slack conditions in the economy are subject to risks, the Governing Board will continue to follow closely all factors and elements of uncertainty that have an impact on inflation and its outlook, and will take the required actions based on incoming information so that the policy rate is consistent with the orderly convergence of headline inflation to Banco de México’s target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates.",
        "Banco de México’s Governing Board will maintain a prudent monetary policy stance and, under the current environment of uncertainty, will follow closely the potential passthrough of exchange rate fluctuations to prices, Mexico’s monetary policy stance relative to that of the U.S.-in an external environment that it is still subject to risks- and the behavior of slack conditions and cost-related pressures in the economy.",
        "In the presence and possible persistence of factors that, by their nature, involve risks to both inflation and its expectations, monetary policy will be adjusted in a timely and firm manner to achieve the convergence of inflation to its 3% target and to strengthen the anchoring of medium- and long-term inflation expectations so that they attain such target.",
        "Alejandro Díaz de León-Carrillo, Irene EspinosaCantellano, Gerardo Esquivel-Hernández, and Jonathan Ernest Heath-Constable voted in favor of lowering the target for the overnight interbank rate to Javier Eduardo Guzmán-Calafell voted in favor of maintaining the target for the overnight interbank rate at 8.25%.",
        "In my judgment, the combined effect of several factors makes monetary policy easing inadequate.",
        "First, although headline inflation has decreased, its core component, which reflects inflationary pressures more accurately, has remained high for a long period and does not show signs of decreasing.",
        "Second, at the moment there is no information on fiscal policy for 2020, a fundamental input for monetary policy implementation.",
        "Third, lowering the policy rate implies surprising the markets, which creates the risk of an adverse reaction and of making the central bank’s communication policy confusing.",
        "In an environment of high external and domestic uncertainty, where the perception of country-risk has increased significantly, the central bank must be extremely cautious given the risk of financial market turmoil.",
        "For these reasons, I believe it is preferable to keep the policy rate unchanged and simultaneously signal that as some uncertainty factors dissipate and a more favorable balance of risks is attained, which is a likely scenario, the central bank would have more solid bases to take advantage of the consequent margins of maneuver, even in the very short term.",
        "Most members of the Governing Board pointed out that during the third quarter of the year the world economy continued to decelerate.",
        "Some members added that this was mainly the result of trade tensions, primarily between the United States and China.",
        "In this regard, one member mentioned the imposition of tariffs between these countries, as well as restrictions to trade in technology and to investment, while another member added that other idiosyncratic factors have also contributed to the economic slowdown.",
        "One member specified the latter has had a differentiated impact across countries, depending on their degree of openness and the overall state of their economies.",
        "The majority of members mentioned that the adverse global environment has contributed to a decline in world trade, in investment and in business confidence as well as in manufacturing production.",
        "One member stated that indicators of global manufacturing activity suggest that it could be reaching an inflection point, which would limit the impact of potential negative effects on world trade and on activity in the services’ sector.",
        "However, he/she added that the possible strengthening of the manufacturing industry is still uncertain.",
        "Most members mentioned that the main advanced economies have decelerated, which has been salient in the industrial sector, and has been mainly motivated by the abovementioned trade disputes.",
        "One member highlighted the fragility of aggregate demand in the euro area and Japan, and its strong dependence on world trade.",
        "Likewise, he/she mentioned that the United States has also been affected by trade disputes, but to a lesser degree.",
        "He/she added that in advanced economies, the services sector has performed better, thus supporting the labor market.",
        "In this regard, another member considered that labor markets in these economies continue to perform strongly, with low unemployment rates, which has allowed consumption and the services sector to be less affected by the economic slowdown.",
        "Regarding emerging economies, one member noted that some of them have been subject to risk factors of an idiosyncratic and political nature, and associated to public policies, which have reinforced the trend of lower growth and uncertainty and have hindered investment.",
        "Another member mentioned that emerging economies have shown some recovery, which could more than offset the weakening trajectory of advanced economies.",
        "Considering the above, he/she stated that the latest information suggests a stabilization of global economic growth by the end of 2019.",
        "With respect to the growth outlook, most members pointed out that it has continued to be adjusted to the downside.",
        "One member delved into the fact that, although an outlook of low interest rates has consolidated for a long time, investment tends to be more sensitive to an environment of high economic uncertainty.",
        "He/she added that, for that reason, it is likely that investment will remain weak and that looser financial conditions will support households’ spending and lead to greater leverage, rather than encouraging an increase in capital accumulation.",
        "Most members noted that trade tensions between the U.S. and China have eased, and that the probability of a disorderly exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union has diminished.",
        "One member pointed out that in the U.S. there is a lower probability of additional tariffs on imports of vehicles and vehicle parts from the European Union, among others economies.",
        "Another member considered that the favorable evolution of trade tensions, as well as the more accommodative stances adopted by the main central banks have mitigated the perception of risk for global economic activity.",
        "Nevertheless, most members emphasized that risks to the global economy persist, associated to trade tensions and geopolitical factors as well as political and social uncertainty in different countries.",
        "One member pointed out that emerging economies are facing considerable challenges, such as a greater-thananticipated deceleration, both at a global level and in some of these countries, particularly in China, where the authorities’ efforts to implement countercyclical measures could be insufficient.",
        "Another member mentioned that the global economic situation poses significant macroeconomic policy challenges.",
        "He/she stated that the room for maneuver for fiscal policy is limited, and that it is worrying that global indebtedness has reached historic highs.",
        "Finally, he/she argued that increasing the debt burden would imply adding more financial vulnerabilities to the world economy and could represent a major obstacle for sustainable growth.",
        "In this context, most members agreed that the balance of risks to world economic activity remains biased to the downside.",
        "Considering the weak economic environment, most members underlined that global inflation pressures have diminished.",
        "One member indicated that the indirect effects of the lower energy prices have also contributed to the above.",
        "In the case of the main advanced economies, most members mentioned that headline and core inflation remain below their central banks’ targets.",
        "One member added that inflation expectations for this group of economies have also been at levels below such targets.",
        "Most members agreed that these developments in inflation have taken place despite the upturn in wages, associated with the relative strength of the labor market.",
        "One member added that inflation in various emerging economies is also at levels below their respective targets.",
        "Finally, one member considered that the balance of risks for world inflation remains biased to the downside.",
        "The majority of members pointed out that some central banks of the main advanced economies have taken measures to relax monetary conditions in recent months.",
        "One member highlighted that the contribution of additional stimuli to address the economic slowdown is increasingly smaller.",
        "All members underlined that in its October meeting, the US Federal Reserve cut the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points.",
        "Most added that, with this decision, a 75 basis point decrease has accumulated this year.",
        "They highlighted that the Federal Reserve communication indicates that the attained range is appropriate, considering the risks faced by the US economy and that, therefore, no further adjustments are expected in the short term.",
        "One member highlighted that the adjustment in the federal funds rate was made despite the fact that inflation is at its symmetrical 2% target and despite the strength of economic activity and of the labor market, given that, in his/her opinion, the Federal Reserve considers that uncertainty is high.",
        "In addition, another member stated that, given the referred adjustment, the US Treasury bonds’ yield curve is no longer inverted, even in its shorter segments.",
        "For the euro area, Japan and the United Kingdom, most members noted that the central banks of these countries have declared that they will maintain accommodative monetary policy stances until they reach their respective inflation targets.",
        "One member underlined that the European Central Bank increased its monetary stimulus considerably in September.",
        "Some members pointed out that the Bank of Japan stated that it could even reduce its interest rate in case it was necessary.",
        "As for emerging economies, another member expressed that most central banks have eased their monetary policies during the year.",
        "He/she mentioned that some of these have lowered their interest rates to a greater degree than the Federal Reserve, as Brazil Indonesia (100bp).",
        "Most members agreed that global financial markets exhibited lower volatility, due mainly to the mitigation of the above mentioned global risks.",
        "In addition, they indicated that the accommodative monetary policy stances in the main advanced economies have contributed to a better performance of such markets in recent weeks.",
        "Some members mentioned that, in view of a lower risk aversion, stock markets have recorded gains.",
        "One member noted that these have reached historic highs.",
        "Another member added that since the last monetary policy decision, advanced economies’ interest rates increased moderately and the US dollar registered a generalized depreciation.",
        "Most members pointed out that during the last weeks capital flows to emerging economies exhibited a positive trend, both to fixed income and equity markets, and that the currencies of these economies appreciated against the US dollar and their risk premia decreased.",
        "One member mentioned that both in advanced and emerging economies, financial markets anticipate an environment of low interest rates and that over 30% of fixed income instruments exhibit negative returns.",
        "However, he/she noted that volatility episodes have been observed during the periods in which different risk factors have intensified.",
        "In this context, most members indicated that financial markets could be affected by the prevailing risks to the global economy.",
        "Some members argued that these could, to a greater extent, affect emerging markets.",
        "One member pointed out that the negative effect of the materialization of such risks on financial markets should not be overestimated, given that the central banks of the main economies would seek to improve global financial conditions via more accommodative monetary policy stances.",
        "Some members considered that the risks to international financial markets have subsided, and one of them mentioned that the balance of risks to global financial markets remains neutral.",
        "All members pointed out that latest information on the third quarter of 2019 shows that the stagnation that economic activity in Mexico has been exhibiting for several quarters continues.",
        "Most members agreed that there has been practically no economic growth during a year and a half.",
        "Some members added that in the third quarter growth was marginal.",
        "One member specified that the economy grew 0.1%, while in the annual comparison a 0.4% contraction was observed.",
        "Some members highlighted that economic activity is decelerating at a faster-thananticipated pace.",
        "One member added that if the figures for the third quarter are confirmed, the first annual contraction since 2009 would be registered, along with the first desynchronization of the Mexican economy in 25 years with respect to the US economic cycle.",
        "Some members pointed out that such contraction would have its origins in the uncertainty related to domestic factors, such as governance problems and public expenditure below the programmed, and to external factors, such as the USMCA ratification process.",
        "Regarding aggregate demand, most members highlighted the weakening of consumption and the lack of dynamism of investment.",
        "Delving into the evolution of consumption, one member added that it has decelerated despite the continuous increase in remittances and in the total wage bill in real terms.",
        "Another member added that the weakness of consumption is evident in durable goods, while retail sales have registered sustained growth, which could be related to the expansion and creation of some social programs.",
        "As for investment, he/she highlighted that, after having followed a clear negative trend during the year, August figures were positive, albeit still insufficient to consider that there has been a change of trend.",
        "Another member specified that public investment has been contracting for several years and continues to bear the adjustment of public finances, while private investment has been affected by the uncertainty related to the trade relationship in North America and other domestic factors since late 2016.",
        "As for external demand, most members indicated that manufacturing exports lost dynamism, although some members pointed out that automotive manufactures destined to the U.S. partially offset the referred fall.",
        "On the supply side, most members mentioned the weakness exhibited by the industrial sector, in particular construction and mining.",
        "One member pointed out that the weakness in the mining sector was due to lower oil production.",
        "Meanwhile, another member highlighted that industrial activity started to rebound in August and seems to have stopped falling after reaching a minimum in July.",
        "He/she added that this behavior is accounted for by a better performance of mining, which finally appears to have started reverting the negative trend it had shown for many years, and because manufactures have continued to grow, showing greater resilience against an adverse environment.",
        "With respect to tertiary activities, most members noted their stagnation throughout 2019, which is a cause for concern.",
        "In this regard, one member highlighted that, in the past, these activities have contributed significantly to economic growth.",
        "Another member indicated that tertiary activities are the largest sector of the economy and added that most of their components have weakened, although activities such as transportation, trade and recreation are starting to show a slight recovery.",
        "One member noted that only primary activities performed favorably.",
        "Regarding the labor market, most members stressed the strong decline in the pace of formal job creation during the year.",
        "In this respect, one member noted that as of October 2019 the growth rate of annual formal employments was 1.68%, which is below the mentioned that the unemployment rate has risen moderately.",
        "However, one member added that this has been accompanied by higher rates of underemployment and informal sector employment.",
        "He/she argued that, in addition to the lack of dynamism, the labor market is characterized by the creation of job posts that are, to a large extent, of low quality or that cannot meet the workers’ needs.",
        "Some members noted that the performance of the labor market reflected the weakness of the economy.",
        "One member added that it has also reflected a trajectory of wages that has been incompatible with the evolution of productivity.",
        "Most members agreed that the stagnation of economic activity has implied the widening of slack conditions in the economy at a faster rate than foreseen.",
        "Some members noted that the negative output gap is expected to continue widening throughout next year.",
        "Most members mentioned that, based on the most recent data, expected GDP growth for the present and next year will be lower than that published in the Quarterly Report April – June 2019.",
        "Similarly, one member pointed out that specialists surveyed by the central bank once again revised their growth expectations downwards for the current and following years.",
        "With respect to growth in 2019, one member indicated that the economy would not grow in the last quarter of the year and another one added that, therefore, a delay is anticipated in the recovery foreseen for such quarter.",
        "Another member noted that this would partly be due to factors such as strikes and technical shutdowns that would affect the performance of the automotive industry during the fourth quarter of the year.",
        "Meanwhile, another member estimated that economic activity will tend to improve moderately starting next year, despite the current stagnation due to the statistical comparison basis, which will be more evident in certain sectors of the industry, for instance, in construction.",
        "In the same vein, he/she mentioned that 2020 will be a leap year, and therefore there will be an extra day to produce goods and services, as compared to the previous year.",
        "Finally, another member highlighted that the weakness of gross fixed investment has had considerable implications for the evolution of the economy’s capital stock and that its growth rate is estimated to intensify in 2019 the downward trend it has been showing over the last years, with the consequent risks for potential growth.",
        "Most members noted that in an environment of marked uncertainty, the balance of risks to growth continues biased to the downside.",
        "One member considered that such balance has deteriorated significantly given the unfavorable dynamics of the services sector and emphasized that one of the most important risks that economic activity faces is the continuation of very restrictive monetary policy stance for too long, because it operates through channels that affect real variables, such as consumption and investment.",
        "Some members stated that growth is subject to both external and domestic risks.",
        "Among external risks, besides the global risks described above, one member mentioned the threat of tariffs by the United States on Mexico, and delays in the USMCA ratification.",
        "Another member added that manufacturing exports could be affected by the evolution of industrial production and of the automotive sector in both the United States and the rest of the world.",
        "With regards to domestic risks, some members mentioned the situation of Pemex and of public finances.",
        "Regarding the latter, one member highlighted the risk of a reduction in public revenues and internal factors that affect confidence and the outlook for the Mexican economy.",
        "Another member added the negative effect of maintaining very high interest rates on public finances.",
        "One member mentioned various upward risks to growth: i) the possibility of the USMCA being ratified in the short term, which would improve the certainty outlook for investment; and ii) a better implementation of public policies.",
        "Finally, he/she added that the negative factors that affected the economic performance in 2019 are not likely to occur again, such as the difficulties caused by the fuel shortages, the strikes in Tamaulipas, the railroad blockages, and the suspension of important infrastructure projects.",
        "Most members mentioned that headline inflation has remained stable, and that in October it was 3.02% and thus lies around the point target.",
        "The majority stressed that this performance is due to the fact that non-core inflation has remained at low levels, lying at 1.01% in October, while core inflation has remained at higher levels, although it has shown a slight decline to 3.68% in such period.",
        "One member considered that headline inflation has declined at a faster-than-anticipated pace.",
        "Regarding non-core inflation, most members indicated that it is at historically low levels and pointed out that in recent months some downward risks have materialized in this subindex.",
        "Some members highlighted the lower rates of change of energy and agricultural and livestock product prices.",
        "One stressed that these have recently shown the lowest levels on record.",
        "However, most members highlighted that non-core inflation is subject to a high degree of volatility.",
        "With respect to core inflation, most members agreed that it has continued to show persistence.",
        "One member pointed out that it has remained at around that within the core component there are greater pressures on the prices of services other than housing and on food merchandise, partly due to the indirect effects of the energy price increases during the second half of last year and of wage increases since the start of this year, which also have a lagged effect.",
        "One member added that, given the negative output gap, an exchange rate that has remained most of the year at more appreciated levels than at the end of 2018, energy prices with negative annual growth and agricultural product prices with moderate growth, wages are the variable that seems to be contributing, to a larger extent, to core inflation’s persistence.",
        "He/she pointed out that econometric exercises lead to the same conclusion.",
        "Meanwhile, some members mentioned that core inflation has recently shown slightly lower readings.",
        "One member noted that in October it declined for the fourth consecutive month.",
        "Some members considered that the fall of core inflation is essentially explained by the lower growth of services prices.",
        "Most members indicated that short-term inflation expectations drawn from surveys have followed the latest data, while longer term expectations have remained relatively stable, albeit at levels above 3%.",
        "Some members detailed that in October headline inflation expectations for year-end 2019 decreased to 3%.",
        "One member added that for 2020 and for the medium and long terms they stood at 3.5%.",
        "Some members mentioned that compensation for inflation and inflationary risk implied in fixed income instruments has continued to decrease.",
        "One of them specified that break-even inflation is at its lowest level of the year.",
        "Regarding inflation forecasts, most members mentioned that the recent behavior of the factors that affect the foreseen trajectory of headline inflation suggests that it may lie slightly below the trajectory set forth in the previous Quarterly Report.",
        "One member pointed out that at the end of the year inflation is likely to be below the target.",
        "Meanwhile, another member stated that, on balance, the latest data on inflation and the expected trajectory of different economic variables do not significantly alter the outlook for the performance of headline and core inflation for the following months.",
        "One member indicated that, despite expectations of headline inflation converging to its target, the trajectory depends on core inflation’s persistence easing and on non-core inflation converging to levels close to the inflation target.",
        "Some members emphasized that a slight increase in headline inflation is expected in the first quarter of next year, as a consequence of the comparison base, calendar effects and seasonality.",
        "One mentioned that it is foreseen that inflation will return to levels of around 3% starting in the second quarter of 2020.",
        "Regarding the outlook for core inflation, one member outlined that its performance in the following quarters will depend on the interaction between the indirect effects of the energy price and wage increases, with the effects of the greater slack in the economy.",
        "He/she pointed out that core inflation is estimated to follow a gradual declining trajectory towards 3% within the forecast horizon, slightly above that anticipated in the last Quarterly Report.",
        "One member considered that there are two factors that make it possible to anticipate a greater reduction in the core component.",
        "On the one hand, the moving average of the annualized monthly changes of this indicator remains at low levels of 3.3%.",
        "On the other hand, fundamental core inflation, that is, the one that is more closely associated to the economic cycle, was only 3.38% in October.",
        "With respect to non-core inflation, another member indicated that this component is expected to rebound to levels much closer to 3%.",
        "In relation to upward risks to inflation, most members mentioned the possibility of core inflation continuing to show persistence.",
        "Some members added that this could occur despite the greater slack in the economy.",
        "In this respect, one member detailed that risks to core inflation’s trajectory are evident when considering that close to 70% of the basket of the item that includes services other than housing and education, excluding tourism, continues to show annualized monthly growth rates above 4%.",
        "In this context, some members expressed their concern about the persistence of headline and core inflation expectations above the central bank forecast for Most members added the following risks: i) wage increases above productivity gains, and that this generates cost pressures.",
        "Some mentioned that there is uncertainty associated with the new adjustments to the minimum wage in 2020: ii) that the peso exchange rate comes under pressure from both external and domestic factors; iii) the threat of tariffs by the United States and that compensatory measures are adopted, although they considered that this risk has diminished; iv) that public finances deteriorate; and, v) increases in agricultural, livestock or energy prices greater than expected.",
        "In addition, some members pointed out the risk that non-core inflation registers a reversal to its historic values.",
        "One member mentioned the composition of observed inflation as a risk to its trajectory.",
        "He/she indicated that currently its components do not correspond to a long-term equilibrium, given that non-core inflation is abnormally low and core inflation is high.",
        "As for downward risks, most members mentioned the following: i) a possible appreciation of the peso exchange rate, which could likely be associated with a context of greater risk appetite in international financial markets or in case the trade agreement with the United States and Canada is ratified; ii) that slack conditions widen more than expected or that their impact on core inflation is greater than foreseen; in this regard, one member indicated that, given that a negative output gap is observed, no demand-related inflation pressures are anticipated; and, iii) the possibility that the prices of certain goods included in the non-core subindex register lower rates of change.",
        "Some members pointed out as a possible indicator of lower inflationary pressures the fact that the producer price index was 0.6% in October as compared to the same month of the previous year, noting that this rate is the lowest observed since August 2015.",
        "In this context, most members agreed that uncertainty still persists regarding the risks that could make inflation deviate from its foreseen trajectory.",
        "One member considered that, although the balance of risks is more balanced in the short term, in a longer-term perspective it could become uncertain due to the above mentioned dynamics of the headline inflation components.",
        "Another member mentioned that although the balance of risks is complex, in his/her opinion, it continues biased to the upside.",
        "One member estimated that risks to inflation have subsided considerably during this year, associated with better global financial conditions and with the above mentioned downward risks.",
        "Therefore, he/she considered that the balance of risks to inflation remains neutral.",
        "Most members agreed that financial markets in Mexico performed favorably, in line with the improvement in global financial conditions.",
        "They indicated that government bond yields declined for all terms.",
        "One member specified that stronger decreases were observed in certain short-term segments, and another one indicated that interest rates have remained at their lowest levels of the year.",
        "One member added that the recomposition towards longer term assets in foreign investors’ portfolio continued.",
        "Another member stated that nominal and real yield curves are inverted in their shortest tranches.",
        "He/she added that, after breaking down long-term interest rates into short-term interest rate expectations and term premia, it is found that both components have declined in recent months.",
        "He/she argued that maintaining a prudent macroeconomic policy stance has been crucial for yield curves, both nominal and real, especially in their long end, to be adjusting in an orderly manner and to the downside, in a context of a slowdown of economic activity, looser global financial conditions, and idiosyncratic risks.",
        "All members noted that the peso exchange rate appreciated slightly.",
        "One member stressed that such appreciation occurred in a context of better market trading conditions.",
        "Another member highlighted that the Mexican peso has performed better than other Latin-American economies’ currencies, which he/she associated partly to the fact that the short-term interest rate in Mexico is higher.",
        "One member added that the exchange rate has maintained a favorable outlook in light of the possible ratification of the USMCA.",
        "Some members mentioned that the stock market recorded slight gains.",
        "As for risk premia, most members emphasized that these decreased.",
        "One member stated that the Credit Default Swap (CDS) premium has decreased, both for the sovereign and Pemex’s debt, as both of these were at their lowest levels of the year.",
        "Another member emphasized that despite this reduction, the level of the sovereign CDS premium suggests that markets are still discounting a downgrade of Mexico’s credit rating, given that said CDS level is above those of other countries with a similar or even lower credit rating.",
        "Most members agreed that risks persist, which could affect the performance of financial assets in Mexico.",
        "Among these risks is a possible downgrade of the sovereign and Pemex’s ratings.",
        "In this sense, one member claimed that, given the strong presence of foreign investors, the country is exposed to a reversal of capital flows and to an increase of the country risk premium.",
        "Another member pointed out that economic growth rates consistently below expectations are a risk to domestic financial markets.",
        "One member considered that, although risks for domestic financial markets have diminished, an important risk faced by these markets currently is the continuation of an overly-tight monetary policy for a prolonged period.",
        "He/she stated that an interest rate that is too high, in addition to affecting growth and public finances, contributes to maintain the exchange rate appreciated, which not only affects net exports, but also attracts speculative capital, which could increase the country’s financial vulnerabilities.",
        "He/she stated that it is possible that a very high interest rate, which in principle would seek to protect the economy from certain risks, could, paradoxically, end up being an additional destabilizing factor.",
        "Most members mentioned that the current environment continues to pose significant risks that could affect the country’s macroeconomic conditions, its ability to grow, and the economy’s price formation process.",
        "In this regard, they emphasized that it is particularly important that, in addition to a prudent and firm monetary policy, measures to foster an environment of confidence and certainty for investment and higher productivity are adopted, and that public finances are consolidated in a sustainable way.",
        "In this context, they underlined that it is necessary to strengthen the credit rating outlook for the sovereign and Pemex’s debt, as well as to achieve the fiscal targets for 2019 and the goals set in the 2020 Economic Package.",
        "Likewise, they also pointed that strengthening the rule of law, tackling corruption, and fighting insecurity are equally imperative.",
        "One member added that it is important to increase productivity by adopting new technologies and investing in human capital.",
        "Another member mentioned that such measures would prevent potential growth from further deteriorating.",
        "Delving into Pemex’s financial situation, the majority of members acknowledged that efforts for refinancing the company’s external liabilities have had a favorable impact, as recognized by markets.",
        "They also mentioned that during the third quarter Pemex registered a positive cash flow and that oil production ceased to fall.",
        "One member added that the state-owned company has improved its financial profile in the short and medium terms.",
        "Some members stated that due to the above, the price of debt instruments stabilized and the premium on its CDS decreased.",
        "One member specified that in addition to the latter, the significant channeling of resources by the federal government contributed to reduce Pemex’s 5-year CDS by 100 basis points over the last weeks and thus the possibility of a downgrade is significantly lower than it was a few months ago.",
        "Nevertheless, the majority warned about Pemex’s business plan continuing to be a cause of concern for the rating agencies.",
        "One member expressed that the state-owned company's financial results as of the third quarter of this year show that it is still premature to consider that the structural problems that have prevented it from being profitable have been overcome.",
        "He/she also mentioned that the International Monetary Fund must be revised.",
        "Another member pointed out that there is skepticism about Pemex’s ability to meet its production and reserve replacement goals.",
        "He/she asserted that one of the rating agencies, whose stance is decisive for maintaining the company’s investment grade, has pointed out that the company’s investment levels are far below those that, in its opinion, are required to increase production and reserves.",
        "Some members indicated that given the above, markets seem to continue discounting that Pemex will lose its investment grade.",
        "Faced with this scenario, such members warned that this company could require additional support from the Federal Government, which would exert greater pressure on public finances, which already face the challenge of achieving the revenues projected for next year, in an environment in which economic activity may be lower than originally forecasted.",
        "One member pointed out that, given the aforementioned, the sovereign credit rating may also be affected.",
        "Delving into the state of public finances, one member mentioned that according to the IMF, the weakness of public revenues can lead to pressures and that, in the absence of additional measures to raise revenues or reduce spending, it estimates that a fiscal gap of between 0.5 and 1.5% of GDP will appear over the next five years.",
        "On the other hand, another member mentioned that fiscal policy has remained prudent and that the proposal for 2020 is cautious and responsible by presenting a primary surplus of 0.7% of GDP.",
        "Finally, the majority added that, judging from the opinion of business people and analysts, among the obstacles for economic activity in Mexico those that stand out are factors related to problems of insecurity, the rule of law, corruption and the lack of clarity in some public policies.",
        "One member pointed out that the percentage of companies that report having been victims of a crime continued to increase, and that the cost of credit is clearly higher for companies in those states with higher crime rates.",
        "In relation to the monetary policy decision, considering that the lower levels recorded by headline inflation, as well as the ample slack conditions in the economy and the recent behavior of the external and domestic yield curves allow for decreasing the policy rate, the majority considered adequate to reduce by 25-basis points the overnight interbank interest rate to a level of 7.50%.",
        "Most members highlighted that given the high uncertainty outlook faced by inflation, monetary policy must remain prudent.",
        "They stated that the monetary policy stance must be adjusted gradually, incorporate available information, respond to the economy’s conditions, and allow for an orderly and sustained convergence of inflation to the target.",
        "One member argued that the level of the attained rate allows for gradually decreasing the level of monetary restriction, according to the economy’s conditions, and facilitates the efficient convergence of inflation to its target in the time frame in which monetary policy operates.",
        "Another member mentioned that the outlook has become more complex as GDP growth has turned out to be lower than anticipated, while core inflation and inflation expectations continue to show persistence, and an environment of high uncertainty prevails around factors that could affect inflation, even in the short term, such as the wage policy and Pemex’s situation.",
        "In this context, he/she asserted that while any room for maneuver that is available should be used to ease the monetary policy stance, this should be done with caution given the risks faced by the economy.",
        "One member pointed out that it is necessary to determine the best balance for the monetary position that considers i) an external environment of lower inflationary pressures and interest rates; ii) a headline inflation around its target, a persistent core inflation and an atypically low non-core inflation; iii) a widening of economic slack; and iv) the need for aligning short-term interest rates to procure an orderly adjustment of the economy; that is in tune with the yield curve and the risk premia; that contributes to maintain the attractiveness of domestic markets; and that helps the yield curve incorporate short-term interest rate expectations that are consistent with the central bank objectives.",
        "The same member considered that the above suggests that, under the current environment, the monetary policy stance should be adapted gradually.",
        "He/she added that in such process it is necessary to identify, in the best possible manner, the economy’s conditions, the risks that it faces, as well as possible vulnerabilities that might arise.",
        "Some members highlighted that the monetary policy stance is very restrictive, considering both the domestic situation as well as its position relative to other countries, and that therefore the policy rate should be adjusted by 50 basis points.",
        "As for the domestic situation such members argued that economic slack has increased significantly and that inflation is at the central bank’s target.",
        "One of them considered that the adjustment in the interest rate in Mexico is lagging very much behind with respect to the current conditions in the country and in the world.",
        "He/she pointed out that from September 2018 to October 2019 inflation decreased by 200 basis points, while the policy rate is at the same level as in September last year.",
        "In this context, he/she considered that a reduction of only the important fall registered by inflation in the last year.",
        "He/she also argued that it would obviate other factors that have changed significantly during said period: the deceleration of the global economy, the relaxation of monetary policies of advanced and emerging economies, as well as the decline in some internal risks associated with Pemex and public finances.",
        "He/she also mentioned that Mexico is the investment grade emerging market country with the highest real rate in the world, and that it is the only country in Latin America that simultaneously has inflation close to its target together with a tight monetary policy position.",
        "He/she considered such stance atypical, in addition to unjustifiable and insensitive to the current circumstances.",
        "He/she considered such stance inexplicable given that already headline inflation is at its objective and the output gap is at its most negative level since the the interest rate remains too high.",
        "Finally, he/she warned that the monetary policy stance might be contributing to an over-adjustment of the economy in an effort to keep inflation low, which is already at its target level, and considered that monetary policy operates through channels that affect real variables, such as consumption and investment, and thus maintaining a very tight monetary policy stance for a long period constitutes a risk to economic activity, public finances and financial stability.",
        "Given the prospects of a more negative output gap, another member pointed out that although monetary policy is not the most effective instrument to induce a recovery, its transmission mechanisms, especially the interest rate, credit and asset price channels, do influence, albeit modestly, aggregate demand.",
        "Such member added that the primary goal of a 3% inflation should be pursued at the lowest possible cost.",
        "He/she mentioned that the policy rate is over the upper bound of the estimation range for the neutral rate, even after incorporating risk premia.",
        "He/she also considered that since the economic cycle is in its low phase, the monetary policy stance must be reduced in absolute terms, although a tight monetary policy stance is still required in order for core inflation to converge to 3% levels.",
        "However, he/she noted that it is not appropriate to maintain the current levels of monetary tightening, which are higher than those observed in other episodes where inflation was higher, the output gap was positive, and the balance of financial and global risks was less favorable.",
        "One member pointed out that the current economic weakness cannot be overcome with monetary policy measures, as its margins of maneuver are narrow, since the level of the policy rate is a reflection of the risks faced.",
        "In this regard, he/she noted that interest rate spreads with other economies decrease considerably when the foreign exchange risk is incorporated.",
        "He/she added that the evidence suggests that the impact of interest rates on economic activity is relatively modest and that countercyclical policies do not address the main cause of stagnation: an environment of uncertainty and not conducive to investment.",
        "Such member underlined that an imprudent easing of monetary policy, by constituting an additional source of uncertainty, would have an effect opposite to the one intended, and that the risks are particularly high in economies as open as Mexico’s.",
        "He/she argued that monetary policy is not a substitute for the economic and institutional measures needed to foster investment and increase productivity.",
        "Another member pointed out that although economic activity is slowing down at a faster pace than anticipated and slack conditions have widened, the challenges faced by the economy, the price formation process and inflation are not only those that stem from the economy’s cyclical position.",
        "He/she emphasized that there are multiple challenges and risk factors, both external and domestic, which have an impact on the economy and inflation.",
        "As for the monetary policy stance relative to other countries, some members pointed out that Mexico's interest rate spread with respect to the United States is at its highest levels in recent history and considered that a reduction of 25 basis points would keep such spread unchanged.",
        "Such members argued that the relative monetary policy stance is high when taking into consideration that the external and domestic risks faced by the economy have decreased and monetary policy has eased globally.",
        "One of them mentioned that the spread between Mexico and US interest rates is the second highest among emerging and advanced economies.",
        "Another member stated that keeping interest rate spreads constant gives a double false impression: on the one hand, it makes it seem that Mexico is responding mechanically to the Federal Reserve’s actions.",
        "On the other hand, it suggests that there has not been a significant change in the country’s economic and financial conditions, which sends a misleading message about the balance of risks faced.",
        "All members pointed to the notion that while the Federal Reserve's actions are a factor that is considered by Banco de México, they are not a determinant for monetary policy decisions.",
        "One of them added that, from previous decisions, it is possible to observe that Banco de México responds by assessing a wide range of factors that might influence inflation.",
        "Another member highlighted that the monetary policy stance should not be tied to monetary conditions relative to other economies which respond to a different context.",
        "As for monetary policy communication, one member mentioned that Banco de México’s communication policy must be transparent, concise, and easy to understand, so that the general public has an understanding that the central bank actions have as a priority to guarantee the convergence of inflation to the target.",
        "He/she added that the above prevents distortions in inflation expectations that could compromise such convergence, as well as incorrect expectations regarding monetary policy intentions.",
        "He/she mentioned that communication should emphasize that a strategy of gradual and prudent adjustments in the absolute and relative monetary policy stance will be followed, which will strengthen consistency with the economic cycle and with future expectations.",
        "He/she indicated that this strategy must take into account the level of uncertainty and the lag with which monetary policy operates.",
        "Such member added that the forward guidance on the monetary adjustment cycle should be subject to what the margins of absolute and relative monetary policy stances suggest, as well as to incoming data and unexpected events.",
        "He/she mentioned that this strategy should facilitate the understanding of monetary policy actions and improve their effectiveness.",
        "Another member stressed the importance of an adequate and objective communication by the central bank.",
        "He/she also underlined that the tone of the communiqué should highlight the decrease in both inflation and its risks.",
        "He/she pointed out that this would send a message of certainty and confidence and confirm that the central bank can ease monetary policy without compromising its mandate and with the lowest possible costs for the Mexican economy.",
        "The majority of members concluded that under the current environment of high uncertainty it must be communicated that monetary policy will adjust prudently, contributing to an orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to its target.",
        "To guide its monetary policy actions, Banco de México’s Governing Board follows closely the development of inflation vis-à-vis its forecasts, taking into account the monetary policy stance and the time frame in which monetary policy operates.",
        "In this process, it uses available information on all inflation determinants as well as on medium- and long-term inflation expectations, including the balance of risks for such factors.",
        "Monetary policy must also act prudently if for any reason the uncertainty faced by the economy increases significantly.",
        "In this context, considering that the lower levels registered by headline inflation, the ample slack in the economy, as well as the recent behavior of external and domestic yield curves allow for decreasing the policy rate, Banco de México’s Governing Board decided by majority to lower the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 25 basis points to 7.50%.",
        "Two members voted for lowering the target to 7.25%.",
        "In order to consolidate a low and stable inflation, in an environment in which price formation and slack conditions in the economy are subject to risks, the Governing Board will continue to follow closely all factors and elements of uncertainty that have an impact on inflation and its outlook, and will take the required actions based on incoming information so that the policy rate is consistent with the orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to Banco de México’s target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates.",
        "Banco de México’s Governing Board will maintain a prudent monetary policy stance and, under the current environment of uncertainty, will follow closely the potential pass-through of exchange rate fluctuations to prices, Mexico’s relative monetary policy stance in an external environment that it is still subject to risks, and the behavior of slack conditions and cost-related pressures in the economy.",
        "In the presence and possible persistence of factors that, by their nature, involve risks to both inflation and its expectations, monetary policy will be adjusted in a timely and firm manner to achieve the convergence of inflation to its 3% target and to strengthen the anchoring of medium- and long-term inflation expectations so that they attain such target.",
        "Alejandro Díaz de León-Carrillo, Irene EspinosaCantellano, and Javier Eduardo Guzmán-Calafell voted in favor of lowering the overnight interbank interest rate by 25 basis points to a level of 7.50%.",
        "Gerardo Esquivel- Hernández and Jonathan Ernest Heath-Constable voted in favor of lowering the overnight interbank interest rate by 50 basis points to a level of 7.25%.",
        "Headline inflation has performed better than expected and will soon have been at figures very close to the inflation target for a full quarter.",
        "Indeed, accumulated inflation so far allows us to anticipate that annual year-end inflation will be less than 3%.",
        "Although core inflation is still at relatively high levels, its recent trend is clearly downward, and it is estimated to maintain this tendency in the coming months.",
        "On the other hand, the generalized reduction of interest rates in other economies, as well as the widening of the negative output gap and the reduction of certain domestic and external risks, opened up space for easing the country’s relative monetary policy stance.",
        "It is worth remembering that Mexico is an atypical case since it is the only Latin American country that has inflation close to target and, simultaneously, maintains a tight monetary policy stance.",
        "For this reason, I believe that on this occasion it was possible and desirable to reduce the interest rate by 50 basis points, without jeopardizing or compromising Banco de México’s fundamental mandate.",
        "Under the current economic conditions, a too late.",
        "Headline inflation has reached the 3.0% point target, economic activity remains stagnant and forecasts indicate that the negative output gap will continue to widen.",
        "Monetary policy easing is being observed worldwide, as well as relatively stable financial markets and a moderation of domestic and external risks, which, nevertheless, are still latent.",
        "All of the aforementioned favors adopting a less tight policy stance.",
        "I restate that maintaining a tight monetary policy stance is necessary to guarantee a core inflation consistent with the inflation target.",
        "However, the levels of tightness of the current policy stance are the highest in the past eleven years.",
        "In relative terms, despite the reductions in the policy rate, the monetary policy stance has not changed given that monetary policy easing has continued worldwide.",
        "In absolute terms, although there has been a reduction, we are still far above the upper limit of the estimates for the long-term neutral rate.",
        "Consequently, there is a wide margin of maneuver for the proposed reduction, even if considering that the balance of risks for inflation, despite being well-balanced in the short term, is uncertain in a longer time horizon.",
        "Most members of the Governing Board noted that available information suggests that the moderation of world economic growth continued during the third quarter of the year.",
        "In particular, they stressed that global manufacturing production has continued to weaken.",
        "Some members mentioned that the risk of the weakness in the goods sector being passed on to the service sector cannot be ruled out.",
        "One member mentioned that trade tensions have been accumulating throughout the year, with periods of higher tariff threats and considerable impacts on the involved economies and on those more open to trade, which has contributed to the slowdown of world trade and manufacturing production.",
        "He/she noted that this environment of uncertainty has hindered investment and business confidence.",
        "Most members indicated that during the recent weeks there has been more willingness of China and the U.S. to come to an agreement, while the risk of a no-deal exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union seems to have diminished.",
        "One member pointed out that the above helped to improve the business climate.",
        "With respect to the growth outlook, most members pointed out that for once again, highlighting the risks to the global economy.",
        "Such members emphasized among these risks those associated to the following factors: i) a possible intensification of trade tensions; ii) a marked deceleration of the Chinese economy; iii) a disorderly exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union; and, iv) the escalation of political and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.",
        "In addition, one member mentioned that the risk of surprises or unwanted effects of monetary policy actions in advanced economies cannot be ruled out.",
        "In this context, most members pointed out that the balance of risks for world economic activity remains biased to the downside.",
        "Regarding advanced economies, one member indicated that the service sector is still expanding, and that the gap between the Purchasing Managers’ Index of the service sector and that of the manufacturing sector has reached high levels as compared to those of recent years.",
        "Another member pointed out that in the euro area, business confidence indicators and purchasing managers’ indices continued to decline.",
        "With regard to the US economy, some members highlighted the moderation of its growth rate and the weakening of investment.",
        "One member added that exports have also had a negative performance and that manufacturing production remains stagnant.",
        "Another member noted that, by showing signs of a slight deceleration, such economy has started to show the effects of the trade tensions, albeit to a lower degree than other economies, given that it is less dependent on external demand.",
        "He/she mentioned that the inversion of the yield curve in some short-term segments points to a deceleration of the US economy, while another one considered that the probability of a recession in that country is still high.",
        "Most members highlighted the lower inflation pressures worldwide.",
        "In the case of the main advanced economies, they pointed out that both headline and core inflation are below their respective central bank targets, underlining that there are no considerable wage pressures, even in a context of tight labor market conditions.",
        "One member specified that the abovementioned, along with the outlook for lackluster economic activity, contributes to the prevalence of inflation expectations at contained levels.",
        "Another member specified that muted inflation pressures are observed despite the recent wage increases and added that in the major advanced economies services’ inflation is close to members agreed that the lower inflation pressures in advanced and emerging economies have been due to transitory factors, such as the lower energy and food product prices.",
        "One of them highlighted that, despite the above, it should be stressed that in advanced economies core inflation is at low levels and in emerging economies it displays a sustained downward trend.",
        "Another member mentioned that although commodity prices have declined, the recent attacks in Saudi Arabia have affected energy prices, although another member pointed out that such effects have been contained.",
        "From a longer-term perspective, another member considered that technological change and the incorporation of countries with an abundant labor force into globalization have contributed to muted inflationary pressures, given that they have increased productivity and generated more competitive markets, with a lower possibility of passing cost pressures onto prices.",
        "In this context, he/she expressed that advanced economies face important challenges regarding monetary policy conduction.",
        "On the one hand, he/she stated that it would be advisable to take preventive measures to close the inflation gaps and to avoid inflation expectations from consolidating at levels below their targets.",
        "On the other hand, he/she mentioned that more vigorous actions would be required in order for inflation to converge to its target, which would imply using a large part of monetary policy’s reduced room of maneuver or the use of unconventional monetary policies in a sustained manner, thus reducing the margin to face adverse scenarios in the future.",
        "He/she considered that these challenges are greater in the present environment of economic slowdown, and, mainly, in the current conditions registered in the euro area and Japan, which: i) largely depend on external demand and have thus been affected by the slowdown of world trade; ii) their aggregate demand remains fragile; and, iii) their medium- and long-term inflation expectations have consolidated below the inflation target.",
        "He/she pointed out that the monetary policy response of these economies’ central banks has focused on generating great levels of inflation, a goal that has not been achieved, thus perpetuating exceptional monetary conditions.",
        "Another member delved into the criticism of the extent and effectiveness of the unconventional measures.",
        "He/she mentioned that monetary variables have a limited impact on the magnitude and evolution of real variables and therefore the results cannot be sustained in the medium and long term.",
        "He/she added that interest rate levels, which have been even negative in some economies, represent a risk for financial system stability.",
        "Finally, he/she indicated that such measures fail to address the structural barriers that limit growth, such as competitiveness, innovation, legal certainty, and property rights.",
        "All members noted that, given the environment of global economic slowdown and low inflation pressures, several central banks have eased their monetary policy stances.",
        "They noted that, in the case of the US Federal Reserve, in its September meeting, it cut the target range of the federal funds rate by 25 basis points.",
        "One member pointed out that the statement of such decision was perceived by markets to have a less accommodative tone than was expected.",
        "Some members noted that the median of the forecast range of the Federal Open Market Committee does not point to additional adjustments for 2019 and 2020, although one member expressed that market expectations continue incorporating additional reductions during that period.",
        "Most members mentioned that the European Central Bank adopted diverse measures of monetary policy easing by reducing its key deposit facility rate by 10 basis points and by announcing the implementation of a new asset purchase program for an indefinite period.",
        "One member considered that differences still prevail among the members of the monetary policy committees of the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank as to how to address the current juncture.",
        "In addition, another member underlined that the monetary authorities of Japan and England announced their willingness to adjust their monetary policy as circumstances warrant.",
        "As to emerging economies’ monetary policy stances, most members mentioned that they have continued trending towards a greater easing, especially in the cases of Brazil, Chile, Peru, Colombia and Russia.",
        "Regarding the monetary policy outlook, some members pointed out that in the future more accommodative monetary policy stances are foreseen worldwide.",
        "One of them stated that, in addition to monetary policy easing, the governments of some economies, particularly in Asia, have also applied greater fiscal stimuli.",
        "Most members noted that episodes of volatility were registered in international financial markets, mainly associated with trade tensions, although, as mentioned above, these have diminished in recent weeks.",
        "One member pointed out that, during times of higher trade tensions, episodes of search for safe haven assets have been observed, which has affected emerging economies’ markets.",
        "Most members highlighted that, in a context of accommodative monetary policies, global financial conditions have eased.",
        "Some members indicated that interest rates have decreased throughout the yield curve in both advanced and emerging economies.",
        "One of them added that recently stock markets in most countries posted gains and that emerging economies’ currencies appreciated against the US dollar.",
        "Another member noted that the capital outflows from emerging economies which had been observed seem to have stopped, although there is still a possibility of a new reversal of such flows if risks materialize, which would have implications for asset prices and the financial systems of these economies.",
        "He/she added that the easing of global financial conditions has been of smaller magnitude than in previous episodes, as a result of the environment of caution and risk aversion prevailing in international financial markets.",
        "Most members mentioned that these markets could be affected by the prevailing risks for the global economy and considered that emerging economies could be especially affected by a decline in risk appetite.",
        "Nevertheless, one member pointed out that the impact that the materialization of such risks could have on financial markets should be evaluated, given that the central banks of the major economies would seek to improve the global financial conditions via more accommodative monetary policy stances.",
        "Therefore, he/she considered that the balance of risks to global financial markets remains stable.",
        "All members noted that available information suggests that economic activity in Mexico in the previous quarters and in July remained stagnant.",
        "One member specified that economic activity has grown, on average, only 0.02% in the last five quarters, and another one mentioned that it has decelerated at a higher-than-expected rate.",
        "Most members highlighted that a slight improvement in economic activity is anticipated for the July– September period, although one member considered that currently there is scant information available to assess the evolution of the economy during this period.",
        "In regards to aggregate demand components, all members pointed out that exports maintain their dynamism, highlighting the positive performance of manufacturing exports.",
        "One member mentioned that the increase in automotive exports contributed to the above.",
        "As for domestic demand, most members noted the slowdown of consumption, although they specified that it shows signs of recovery at the margin.",
        "In this respect, some members underlined the evolution of some of its determinants, such as the increase in remittances and the growth of the wage bill.",
        "One member specified that consumption of durable goods has registered negative annual rates for three consecutive quarters.",
        "Regarding investment, most members highlighted the downward trajectory of both private and public sector investment.",
        "One member indicated that public investment has contracted for several years and that it has been the public spending item which has borne the brunt of the adjustment in public finances.",
        "Another member indicated that investment and its components exhibit a negative trend since mid-2018.",
        "Most members emphasized the lack of dynamism of construction as well as the decline in imported machinery and equipment.",
        "One member detailed that, similar to public spending, private investment has declined for five consecutive quarters.",
        "He/she mentioned that the lack of investment is one of the most worrisome issues, to such an extent that adverse effects begin to be perceived in the balance of payments.",
        "Some members associated the lack of dynamism of investment with the surplus in the current account during the second quarter of the year.",
        "One of them emphasized that such surplus is visibly higher than others that have been observed previously, even during economic crises.",
        "He/she underlined that gross fixed investment is so low that external savings are not necessary to finance it.",
        "Another member specified that the above should not come as a surprise in a context of tight macroeconomic policies.",
        "He/she indicated that a restrictive monetary policy encourages private savings and discourages investment, while a tight fiscal policy generates higher public savings, and that, therefore, both policies lead to a higher current account balance.",
        "He/she mentioned that such surplus could also be reflecting a change in the structure of aggregate spending, where wage increases, higher remittances and the new social programs could be contributing to a higher consumption of domestically-produced goods and to a reduction in the growth of consumption of imported products.",
        "From a medium-term perspective, one member mentioned his/her concern over the secular slowdown in the growth rate of private consumption that has been observed since 2016, as well as over the stagnation of private investment during the same period.",
        "The same member pointed out that the interest rate and the cost of financing for households and firms have grown steadily since then and that the growth rate of credit by commercial banks has decreased.",
        "He/she considered that the latter brings to the fore that risks associated to maintaining a high interest rate for a long period should not be minimized.",
        "Another member indicated that it is fundamental to keep in mind the factors that have contributed to the weakness of investment.",
        "In this regard, he/she specified that data from surveys conducted among analysts and business contacts indicates that such factors are mainly associated with problems of uncertainty and governance, rather than with monetary policy, to which they assign little importance.",
        "In this sense, one member stated that since late 2016 private investment has been affected by the uncertainty over the foreign trade environment and, recently, by factors of domestic uncertainty.",
        "On the supply side, most members mentioned the weakness shown by industrial production, while one member pointed out that its contraction has been accompanied by an upward trend of manufacturing production and evidence suggesting a moderate growth of the service sector.",
        "Some members highlighted the weakness of construction and mining, and one of them specified that the slowdown of mining was due to lower oil production.",
        "Another member considered that the economic weakness is evident even in the service sector.",
        "Most members noted that growth expectations for foreseen in the Quarterly Report April – June 2019 and indicated that such expectations consider a slight recovery for the rest of the year.",
        "One member pointed out that analysts’ expectations for GDP growth in 2019 continued to decline in August.",
        "Regarding the factors that would support the economic recovery over the next months, one member highlighted the following: i) that the wage bill and the growth of remittances should continue supporting private consumption; ii) the sectoral composition of the evolution of US manufacturing production, combined with export opportunities for Mexican products as a result of the trade conflict between the U.S. and China; and, iii) the anticipated recovery of public expenditure given the underspending observed during the first half of the year.",
        "He/she added that, despite the expected improvement in the rate of economic growth during the second half of 2019 and in 2020, the economy would remain in a situation of weakness.",
        "He/she underlined that this would be accompanied by a lack of dynamism in investment, given that this indicator is not anticipated to reverse its contraction of recent months.",
        "All members highlighted that, in an environment of marked uncertainty, the balance of risks for growth remains biased to the downside.",
        "Thus, most members argued that growth is subject to both external and domestic risks.",
        "Among external risks, in addition to the already described global risks, one member mentioned the possible delays in the ratification of the USMCA, together with new threats of US tariffs imposed on Mexico, although the latter has subsided recently.",
        "Regarding domestic risks, such member emphasized the possibility of additional reductions in public revenue and domestic factors affecting the confidence and the outlook for the Mexican economy.",
        "He/she added that in Mexico, as in other emerging economies, idiosyncratic risk factors have reinforced the impact of the global trend of lower growth and uncertainty that have hindered investment.",
        "Another member specified that the risk that economic activity remains stagnant or that it deteriorates even further persists, pushing the economy towards a recession.",
        "He/she added that coincident indicators generated by INEGI to establish the trajectory of the economic cycle indicate the need to remain watchful of a possible recession.",
        "Most members agreed that slack conditions have widened, although at the beginning of the third quarter they remained at levels similar to those of the previous quarter, with a persistent negative output gap.",
        "One member noted that, if the slight recovery foreseen for the third quarter of the year is confirmed, it could moderate the widening of slack conditions observed during the second quarter of the year.",
        "In this regard, some members specified that negative output gaps are expected within the forecast horizon, although one of them mentioned that slack conditions could loosen less than anticipated.",
        "With respect to the labor market, most members noted that it has continued to weaken and some members highlighted that the unemployment rate has increased.",
        "However, one member emphasized that it is still below the Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment (NAIRU), and that, for this reason, its increase does not imply the presence of slack.",
        "Another member mentioned that the weakness of the labor market has been particularly reflected in the behavior of formal employment, and specified that in August 2019 the number of jobs enrolled at IMSS increased by 343,000 in annual terms, while in the same month of the previous year, the increase was 750,000 in annual terms.",
        "He/she added that increases have simultaneously been observed not only in the unemployment rate, but in informal sector employment and in underemployment.",
        "Some members considered that the weakness of the labor market is partly associated with the economic slowdown.",
        "One of them added, as a factor explaining such weakness, the increase in the growth rate of unit labor costs, resulting mainly from the simultaneous effect of the contractions in labor productivity and the increases in mean real earnings.",
        "All members mentioned that between July and the first fortnight of September headline inflation declined from 3.78% to 2.99% and noted that such reduction was mainly due to the non-core component.",
        "Most members indicated that headline inflation is in line with the 3% target and some members pointed out that it has decreased faster than anticipated.",
        "One of them pointed out the continuation of the downward trend that inflation has shown since mid-2018.",
        "All members highlighted that non-core inflation has decreased significantly due to the lower increases of energy and agricultural and livestock product prices.",
        "Most members pointed out that this component lies at historically low levels.",
        "Nevertheless, they warned that it is subject to high volatility.",
        "In this context, one member argued that the analysis of inflationary pressures should not rely exclusively on the evolution of the headline price index since, currently, due to the high volatility of the non-core component, it may provide only a partial and even erroneous view of the trend of inflation.",
        "The majority of members pointed out that core inflation has remained persistent around 3.8%.",
        "Some members noted that the abovementioned is in part due to the evolution of food merchandise and services prices.",
        "One member underlined that core inflation has remained at levels above 3% for over seventeen months, higher than the path foreseen by Banco de México.",
        "He/she also mentioned that the trimmed mean of core inflation indicates that pressures are not concentrated only on a few products.",
        "Another member stated that the persistence of this component reflects, among other factors, the indirect effects of the increases in energy product prices in the second half of 2018 as well as those related to the minimum wage increases since the beginning of 2019, which have a lagged impact.",
        "He/she also highlighted that at the margin there were greater pressures on services than on merchandises.",
        "One member emphasized the core inflation has been decreasing since April and that inflation of both food merchandise and food services prices are trending downwards, after having reached maximum levels some months ago.",
        "He/she pointed out that the six-month moving average of the monthly annualized rates of change of core inflation continues trending downwards, reaching 3.33% in August.",
        "He/she mentioned that, if this behavior continues, its annual rates of change will eventually reflect similar levels.",
        "Another member considered that it is too early to conclude that core inflation has resumed a downward trend.",
        "He/she emphasized that inflation of food services, transportation, and recreation prices is at high levels and around 4.5%.",
        "Some members noted that short-term inflation expectations drawn from surveys have followed the latest data, while longer term ones have remained relatively stable, although at levels above 3%.",
        "One member explained that, during April and May, analysts increased their inflation expectations to Nevertheless, in August, they lowered them to only what was anticipated in previous Quarterly Reports.",
        "For his part, another member pointed out that breakeven inflation and inflationary risk premium implied in fixed income instruments have been decreasing.",
        "Most members mentioned that the baseline scenario for headline inflation is near the path published in the last Quarterly Report.",
        "In this regard, another member considered that, given the slack indicators, the widening of the negative output gap, and the dynamics of agricultural and livestock product prices, there is an increased probability that headline inflation converges to the target not only earlier than expected, but that at the end of the year it lies below the forecasts of the latest Quarterly Report.",
        "One member explained that in the Quarterly Report published in May the forecast for headline inflation for the end of 2019 had increased to 3.7%, but in the latest Report published in August it had decreased to only 3.2%.",
        "Nevertheless, another member noted that the convergence of inflation to the target in 2020 could be delayed.",
        "Regarding core inflation expectations, most members pointed out that it is anticipated to start decreasing as the indirect effects of the shocks on energy product prices fade.",
        "One member added the fading of the shocks on food prices, while another emphasized the effects related to exchange rate adjustments.",
        "The majority highlighted that the downward trend of core inflation would be influenced by the amount of slack in the economy.",
        "One member added that this subindex will also be influenced by the effects of wages, which have a lagged impact.",
        "In this context, some members mentioned that core inflation is still expected to converge to the 3% target within the forecast horizon.",
        "As for upside inflation risks, most members mentioned the possibility that core inflation continues to show persistence.",
        "Some members added that this may occur despite the greater amount of slack in the economy.",
        "One member considered that the persistence of this component would contribute to the increase of its medium-term expectations and of headline inflation expectations remaining above the 3% target, thus hindering the convergence to the target in the foreseen time frame.",
        "The majority of members mentioned the risk that the exchange rate comes under pressure stemming from external or domestic factors.",
        "One member stated that, considering the uncertainty that the economy is facing, this is the most important risk.",
        "In this regard, he/she pointed out that, although the pass-through of exchange rate fluctuations on prices is low, it is not zero.",
        "Another member noted that there is the possibility that the exchange rate depreciates further than expected and puts pressure on prices through a greater pass-through than the observed so far.",
        "Another member warned that, despite evidence that the pass-through effect of the exchange rate is limited, short-term inflation and its expectations are significantly sensitive to sharp exchange rate fluctuations.",
        "Most members mentioned that another upside risk to inflation is the threat by the United States to impose tariffs on Mexican imports and the adoption of compensatory measures, although this risk has diminished.",
        "They added the risk that energy or agricultural and livestock product prices increase.",
        "One member noted the possibility that non-core inflation reverts to its historic values.",
        "In this regard, another member added that, given the high volatility of these products, this risk persists even considering the current administration’s gasoline price policy.",
        "Another member mentioned that, insofar as energy price inflation remains low due to the new pricing policy of the federal government, a perception of low and stable inflation will be generated, which is certain to have a favorable impact on the price formation process.",
        "The majority of members mentioned as risks an environment of weak public finances and that given the magnitude of various wage revisions, cost-related pressures arise, insofar as such revisions exceed productivity gains.",
        "In this regard, one member highlighted that the outlook for wage adjustments for the next year is still uncertain.",
        "Another member considered that, in his/her opinion, the available evidence points to a limited impact of minimum wage increases on inflation, considering that headline inflation is below 3% and that in the border area it is below the national average.",
        "He/she added that inflation of services other than housing and education, which, in principle, could be affected by the wage increases, is not too far from its historic average after excluding the atypical deflationary behavior of the telecommunications sector during global protectionist measures worldwide escalate.",
        "Finally, one member also mentioned the potential impact of the increase to the tax on flavored drinks and on cigarettes projected on the 2020 budget.",
        "Regarding downside risks, most members mentioned the possibility that the peso exchange rate appreciates, which could be associated with a context of more accommodative monetary policy stances and lower interest rates worldwide, or in case that greater certainty arises regarding the trade relation with the United States.",
        "The majority added as a downside risk that the prices of certain goods included in the non-core subindex register lower rates of change.",
        "In this regard, one member explained that energy product prices are following a downward trend associated with the global economic slowdown.",
        "All members mentioned the possibility that slack conditions widen more than anticipated, which would impact the behavior of core inflation.",
        "Nevertheless, one member pointed out that it remains to be seen to what extent the sluggish performance of economic activity contains the pressures on prices.",
        "In this context, the majority of members agreed that high uncertainty regarding the risks that might affect inflation continues to persist.",
        "One member estimated that, given the inflation forecasts and the atypical behavior of the non-core component, it is difficult to gauge the balance of risks.",
        "Another member considered that, although it is difficult to assess a balance of risks in such an uncertain environment, in his/her opinion, it remains biased to the upside.",
        "For their part, some members mentioned that risks have decreased substantially as compared to those of previous months.",
        "One member pointed out that such behavior is associated with the significant downside inflation risks described above and with the balance of risks for growth being sharply biased to the downside.",
        "Another member noted that, although domestic and external risks persist, they are not necessarily at levels above those observed in past episodes.",
        "He/she added that the continuous widening of the output gap, along with a favorable dynamics of agricultural and livestock product prices, suggests a balance of risks for inflation biased to the downside.",
        "Most members pointed out that domestic financial markets have reflected the effects of lower interest rates for all terms in the main advanced economies, as well as episodes of volatility with exchange rate adjustments, although these have diminished over the last weeks.",
        "One member considered that domestic factors, such as the agreement of the federal government with the firms operating gas pipelines, Pemex’s bond repurchase and refinancing, and the presentation of the 2020 Economic Package, contributed to the favorable performance displayed by domestic financial markets in September.",
        "The majority of members stated that yields on government securities for all terms have continued to decrease.",
        "One member pointed out that mixed trajectories were observed for different terms, with sharper falls in those of up to five years.",
        "Another member explained that yields are at their lowest levels of the year.",
        "Another member mentioned that nominal and real yield curves are inverted vis-à-vis the target for the overnight interbank funding rate.",
        "He/she explained that, when decomposing long-term yields, both expectations for short-term interest rates and term premia are found to have fallen in the last months.",
        "He/she added that real interest rates on Udibonos have also decreased.",
        "He/she argued that maintaining prudent macroeconomic stances has been fundamental for the orderly and downward adjustment of nominal and real yield curves, given the combination of looser global financial conditions and the presence of significant idiosyncratic risks.",
        "Some members noted that the peso exchange rate appreciated since the monetary policy decision of August, although another member highlighted that the peso exchange rate has been subject to depreciation episodes associated with uncertainty factors in international financial markets, to idiosyncratic factors, and to contagion from other emerging economies.",
        "Some members mentioned that the stock market registered a significant recovery and one member emphasized that this favorable performance stands out among emerging economies.",
        "As to risk premia, some members pointed out that these have decreased significantly since the last monetary policy decision.",
        "One member explained that such reduction was similar to that observed in other emerging economies, which suggests that it is fundamentally determined by external factors.",
        "He/she emphasized that Credit Default Swaps above those of other emerging economies with a lower credit rating.",
        "He/she argued that, among the main fifteen emerging economies, only Mexico, along with Turkey and Brazil, have registered a downgrading of their sovereign credit rating in the last year.",
        "Finally, another member stated that capital inflows from foreign investors have been negative with regard to those channeled to fixed income instruments, although their holdings maintain a balance similar to that observed in previous years, while inflows destined to equity instruments were positive.",
        "As to the risks that may affect the performance of financial assets in Mexico, most members mentioned that uncertainty persists with respect to the bilateral relationship between Mexico and the United States and to the credit rating outlook both for Pemex’s debt and for Mexico’s sovereign debt.",
        "One member highlighted the possibility of a deterioration of public finances.",
        "In addition, another member considered that although several uncertainty factors persist in the external environment, the measures adopted by the central banks of the main economies have contributed to mitigate such risks.",
        "He/she also considered that most domestic risks associated with public policies such as those related with public finances and Pemex, have been fading throughout the year.",
        "He/she added that, in his/her opinion, the most important financial risks for domestic financial markets are low growth and maintaining an overly restrictive monetary policy.",
        "The majority of members highlighted that the current environment continues to pose significant risks that could affect the country’s macroeconomic conditions, its ability to grow, and the economy’s price formation process.",
        "In this regard, they pointed out that it is particularly important that, in addition to a prudent and firm monetary policy, measures to foster an environment of confidence and certainty for investment and higher productivity are adopted, and that public finances are consolidated in a sustainable way.",
        "In this context, they noted that it is necessary to address the deterioration of both the sovereign’s and Pemex’s credit ratings as well as achieving both the fiscal targets for 2019 and the goals set in the 2020 Economic Package.",
        "They also stated that strengthening the rule of law, tackling corruption, and fighting insecurity are equally imperative.",
        "One member underlined the need to increase productivity through the adoption of new technologies and the strengthening of human capital.",
        "Regarding the 2020 Economic Package, most members agreed that the primary surplus targets are appropriate and that, in general, it was well received by economic agents, although one member added that the new budget implies a trajectory for both the public debt and the public sector’s borrowing requirements as a percentage of GDP slightly above those announced originally.",
        "Some members warned that several analysts have expressed that certain assumptions in the budget, particularly regarding crude oil production and income, are optimistic and, therefore, risk factors for fiscal policy persist.",
        "The majority of members noted that the fiscal support package for Pemex and the recently announced financial measures to strengthen the state-owned company’s financial profile are efforts in the right direction, which have led to a recovery in the value of Pemex’s debt instruments and to a decrease of its CDS premia.",
        "Nevertheless, some members mentioned that most analysts agree that such measures represent a short-term relief since they do not solve the company’s structural problems.",
        "One member highlighted that another problem that Pemex faces is the possibility of observing a lower oil platform than expected due to both the low levels of investment and the cancellation of private participation in new developments that may allow an increase of crude oil production.",
        "Some members warned that the risk of a downgrading of Pemex’s credit rating persists and that this would imply the loss of its investment grade.",
        "Although one member acknowledged that expectations of additional actions by rating agencies have been delayed temporarily, another member argued that one rating agency has stated that significant increases of Pemex’s net debt, an operational performance below forecasts, and a decline of crude oil reserves or of their expected duration, may lead to a downgrading of Pemex’s rating, which would bring about the loss of its investment grade.",
        "He/she also pointed out that such agency considers that Pemex’s capital expenditure for 2019 and 2020 is far below the required to replace reserves in these years.",
        "Thus, in his/her opinion, the risk of such event taking place is high.",
        "In this context, one member noted that Pemex remains the main domestic risk factor given its dependence on the federal government’s financial support.",
        "He/she mentioned that, although financial instruments continue to discount the downgrading of Pemex’s credit rating, it cannot be ruled out that its materialization would trigger forced sales that may generate disorderly adjustments in financial markets.",
        "He/she added that the cessation of bidding rounds or the revision of contracts granted to the private sector for the supply of natural gas, have generated uncertainty and affected the confidence of economic agents.",
        "He/she warned about several sources of uncertainty for public finances, such as the pressures associated with the growing pensions and the financial support to Pemex.",
        "He/she also pointed out that revenues may be lower than expected, due to lower economic growth.",
        "He/she noted that the abovementioned represents a challenge, given that the resource gap would need to be offset with greater public spending cuts, a higher tax-collection capacity and, probably, with the use of more resources from the Oil Revenues Stabilization Fund (FEIP, for its acronym in Spanish) which may lead to future pressures on public finances, given that part of the reserves to face future shocks would be depleted.",
        "As for the monetary policy decision, considering the reduction of headline inflation, the width of slack conditions in the economy, and the recent behavior of external and domestic yield curves, most members considered that lowering the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 25 basis points to 7.75% is consistent with the convergence of inflation to the central bank’s target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates.",
        "The majority of members highlighted that maintaining a prudent monetary policy is necessary given the uncertain scenario that inflation faces.",
        "In this regard, one member argued that the monetary policy stance should be adjusted gradually, carefully assessing the incoming information to better identify the conditions in the economy, the process of inflation reduction, and the balance of risks for both.",
        "He/she underlined that, although in the baseline scenario inflation converges to its target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates, risks that may affect this forecast and delay the consolidation of lower inflation persist.",
        "He/she pointed out that such has been the case in the last two years with the presence of factors that have affected the domestic economy, the price formation process, and which have led to a greater resistance of core inflation to decline.",
        "In addition, such member mentioned that, although short-term interest rate spreads remain high, the peso exchange rate has been subject to pressures and depreciation episodes.",
        "Another member explained that the new level of the policy rate allows for reducing the level of monetary restriction to facilitate the efficient convergence of inflation to its target and maintain the relative monetary policy stance in order to avoid an unnecessarily widening of the spread between short-term instruments denominated in Mexican pesos and in US dollars.",
        "Another member noted that, given the environment described above, monetary policy in Mexico continues to face an uncertain and contrasting outlook.",
        "On the one hand, he/she stated that the additional cut of the US federal funds rate opens up space for monetary policy implementation in Mexico.",
        "He/she added the weakness of the economy, which should be reflected in the evolution of prices, and the importance for the central bank to ensure an orderly adjustment of inflation to the target.",
        "On the other hand, he/she noted the need to take into consideration core inflation’s continuing persistence; that inflation expectations for 2020 and longer terms are above the target; that the sovereign risk increased in the last months; and, that a situation of marked uncertainty may imply a significant shock for the economy in a not-too-distant horizon.",
        "In this context, he/she emphasized that, in his/her opinion, it is not possible to determine a cycle for monetary policy.",
        "He/she added that monetary policy must prioritize prudence and effectively respond to the needs that arise according to incoming data and the circumstances at each point in time.",
        "He/she pointed out that an important part of the environment of concern that the economy is facing stems from domestic factors that limit the scope of action for monetary policy.",
        "He/she stated that the implementation of decisive measures to solve such challenges would allow not only for a more balanced economic policy approach, but also to mitigate the situation of uncertainty, the central problem behind the complex performance of the economy.",
        "Some members considered that a 50 basis point adjustment to the target rate was appropriate.",
        "One member argued that taking into consideration the latest reduction in the federal funds rate, a 25 basis point reduction to the policy rate in Mexico would leave the monetary policy stance relative to that of the United States at historically high levels, despite the fact that inflation is at 3%, that the economy is in a slump with a persistent negative output gap which is widening, and that global risks have declined.",
        "He/she added that with a 50 basis point reduction to the policy rate in Mexico, the interest rate spread between Mexico and the United States would still be very much above the spreads of all emerging economies within the same group of assets.",
        "The current spread between the target level for the monetary policy rate and observed inflation in Mexico is not only the widest among comparable emerging economies, but also turns out to be practically twice Russia’s, which has the second highest rate in this group of economies and which has reduced rates by 75 basis points so far this year.",
        "Even with a 50 basis point reduction, in relative terms we would have a spread with the United States of 550 basis points, and that such spread would still be very much above practically all relevant emerging economies for our class of assets.",
        "The only country that would be above Mexico would be Turkey, a country which faces an inflation rate of many believe must be maintained given the risks faced by the Mexican economy, would continue to be the highest among this group of countries.",
        "The same member added that a level of 7.5% is still a rate above the ceiling of the risk-adjusted neutral range.",
        "He/she added that considering that the Mexican economy is still far from potential, the policy rate in real terms that is consistent with the current juncture would be below natural rate estimates, which is the real rate consistent with GDP at its potential level and with inflation at its target.",
        "In this regard, he/she concluded that, considering the economy’s cyclical position, the current monetary policy stance is even more restrictive.",
        "In this context, the same member pointed out that although in the current conditions the monetary policy stance must remain restrictive, there is wide room for maneuver and a window of opportunity to lower the monetary policy rate and still maintain its restrictive character, but less so than currently, considering that the present monetary policy stance is the most restrictive in the last ten years in absolute and relative terms, even above that observed in periods in which inflation was higher and there was significant uncertainty and greater risks.",
        "Nevertheless, he/she acknowledged that currently there are numerous risks and that looking ahead, the Bank must act cautiously and according to incoming information.",
        "He/she pointed out that the highly restrictive monetary policy stance must be adjusted to a less restrictive one, although the pace of such an adjustment will have to weigh the risks to core inflation.",
        "The same member pointed out that it is essential to maintain a prudent policy stance until the Bank clearly fulfils its mandate in a more solid manner given that in order to ensure that headline inflation remains around 3%, it is necessary for core inflation to converge to that same level, albeit currently it is not very far from 3%.",
        "Another member mentioned that, given the latest reduction in the federal funds rate, a 25 basis point reduction to the reference rate in Mexico would make the monetary policy stance relative to that of the United States remain unchanged, which could give the impression that Banco de México is following mechanically the US Federal Reserve.",
        "He/she was of the opinion that it would be advisable to send the signal that the Bank is acting independently and is responding mainly to an improvement of domestic conditions.",
        "He/she also added that so far this year, other central banks in Latin America have loosened their monetary policy stances to a greater extent than Banco de México and that currently their policy rates are lower.",
        "He/she argued that the latter illustrates that Mexico’s monetary policy stance is very restrictive, especially taking into account that inflation is near its target.",
        "He/she added that the current conditions allow for a greater monetary policy easing in the Mexican economy than in other advanced or emerging economies, given that in some of these, the margin of maneuver is limited because interest rates are already at low levels.",
        "The same member emphasized that domestic conditions in Mexico have changed significantly over the last year.",
        "Such member pointed out that in September 2018, headline inflation was 5.02%, which implies that in a year inflation decreased slightly more than 200 basis points.",
        "In addition to the improvement in the country’s economic outlook, he/she mentioned the sharp economic deceleration in the last year, the radical adjustment in the monetary policy outlook of advanced economies, and the satisfactory outcome of certain uncertainties that had been present, especially regarding the fiscal situation that would prevail under a new administration in Mexico.",
        "Such member mentioned that if the policy rate were to be reduced only by 25 basis points, it would only allow a return to the rate that was in effect in September monetary policy stance would have just remained constant despite the fact that the present domestic and international conditions are completely different from those at that time.",
        "Lastly, the same member pointed out that the tone of the monetary policy statement should highlight the significant decline of both inflation and its risks during the year, and also the fact that inflation has been below both market expectations and the central bank’s forecasts.",
        "Such member argued that this would send a message of certainty and confidence, confirming that the central bank has inflation under control and that it can loosen its monetary policy stance, seeking to keep inflation at its target with the least possible costs for the Mexican economy.",
        "The majority of members considered that the central bank message must communicate clearly that the future of monetary policy depends mainly on the evolution of inflation and on how inflation deviates from its expected trajectory, in an environment characterized by high risks and high levels of uncertainty.",
        "Such members highlighted that the monetary policy statement must reflect that the Governing Board considers that the present decision is prudent and consistent with the 3% inflation target and that the current situation, characterized simultaneously by economic weakness and persistently high core inflation in an environment of uncertainty, requires following up closely the incoming information.",
        "One member mentioned that such follow up would allow to update the balance of risks and inflation forecasts in a timely manner, in order to be able to act appropriately, fulfil the price stability mandate effectively, and preserve the confidence gained over twenty five years of central bank independence.",
        "To guide its monetary policy actions, Banco de México’s Governing Board follows closely the development of inflation vis-à-vis its forecasted trajectory, taking into account the monetary policy stance and the time frame in which monetary policy operates.",
        "In this process, it uses available information on all inflation determinants as well as on medium- and long-term inflation expectations, including the balance of risks for such factors.",
        "Monetary policy must also act prudently if for any reason the uncertainty faced by the economy increases significantly.",
        "In this context, considering the reduction of headline inflation, the ample slack in the economy, and the recent behavior of external and domestic yield curves, Banco de México’s Governing Board decided by majority to lower the target for the overnight interbank interest rate to environment such level is consistent with the convergence of headline inflation to the central bank’s target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates.",
        "Two members voted for lowering said target to 7.50%.",
        "In order to consolidate a low and stable inflation, in an environment in which price formation and slack conditions in the economy are subject to risks, the Governing Board will continue to follow closely all factors and elements of uncertainty that have an impact on inflation and its outlook, and will take the required actions based on incoming information so that the policy rate is consistent with the orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to Banco de México’s target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates.",
        "Banco de México’s Governing Board will maintain a prudent monetary policy stance and, under the current environment of uncertainty, will follow closely the potential pass-through of exchange rate fluctuations to prices, Mexico’s monetary policy stance relative to that of the U.S.-in an external environment that it is still subject to risks- and the behavior of slack conditions and cost-related pressures in the economy.",
        "In the presence and possible persistence of factors that, by their nature, involve risks to both inflation and its expectations, monetary policy will be adjusted in a timely and firm manner to achieve the convergence of inflation to its medium- and long-term inflation expectations so that they attain such target.",
        "Alejandro Díaz de León-Carrillo, Irene EspinosaCantellano and Javier Eduardo Guzmán-Calafell voted in favor of lowering the target for the overnight interbank rate by 25 basis points to 7.75%.",
        "Gerardo Esquivel-Hernández and Jonathan Ernest Heath-Constable voted in favor of lowering the target for the overnight interbank rate by 50 basis points to 7.50%.",
        "Headline inflation has behaved better than expected and is already at levels close to Banco de México’s target.",
        "Inflation accumulated in the first three quarters of the year will be below 1%, thus allowing to foresee that inflation will end the year close to or even below 3%.",
        "Although core inflation is still at relatively high levels, it is possible to anticipate that it will diminish over the next months as a result of the fading impact that the increase in energy prices at the end of 2018 had on food prices.",
        "Looking ahead, both headline and core inflation are expected to converge to the target.",
        "In addition, both the widespread reduction of interest rates worldwide and the country’s significant economic deceleration open up some room to lower the policy rate in Mexico far more than the reduction observed in the United States.",
        "For this reason, I consider that on this occasion it is possible and desirable to lower the overnight interbank interest rate by 50 basis points without jeopardizing or compromising Banco de México’s primary mandate.",
        "Although headline inflation is at the 3.0% point target, such target was not attained by a reduction of the core component, making it necessary to maintain a restrictive monetary policy stance.",
        "The question is if a rate as high as the current one is justified, to the extent that in absolute and relative terms it represents the most restrictive policy stance maintained over the last ten years, even above the observed during periods in which we faced higher inflation levels, with high uncertainty and greater risks.",
        "Under the current conditions, there is room to lower the monetary policy rate and still keep its restrictive character given: that the negative output gap is still widening; a smaller deviation of inflation from its target; global risk aversion has diminished and accommodative monetary policies continue to prevail in most economies.",
        "In other words, we must maintain our monetary policy restrictive for as long as necessary, but not as restrictive as the current one.",
        "The present conditions provide a window of opportunity to make this adjustment and for this reason I am in favor of lowering our target rate by 50 basis points."

        "They underlined that growth expectations for advanced economies have adjusted upwards while, in the case of emerging economies, they have been adjusted downwards, as a result of differences in the evolution of the pandemic and in the available space to provide stimulus spending.",
        "One member highlighted the large fiscal stimulus approved in the United States.",
        "Among risks to the global economy, most members pointed out those associated with the spread of the Delta variant.",

        "Among the factors that are affecting global pressures on commodity prices, the shortage of inputs, logistical problems and the temporary mismatch between supply and demand which has affected production chains.",
        "Some members added also the reactivation of the world economy and stimulus spending.",
        "One member mentioned labor market distortions and another one climate-related factors, such as droughts.",
        "Some members highlighted that international organizations, central banks, and analysts agree that the factors that are affecting inflation are of a transitory nature.",
        "One member stated that medium- and long-term inflation expectations remain anchored, which implies that pressures are anticipated to be transitory.",
        "Another member added as evidence that inflationary pressures are transitory, the fact that labor market dynamics remain below pre-pandemic levels and the fall in the labor participation rate.",
        "He/she considered that the factors that exert pressure on inflation cannot operate indefinitely and stand in contrast with structural inflation determinants, such as globalization and technological change.",
        "He/she added that most monetary authorities at the international level have opted for communicating the nature of inflationary pressures and their monetary policy outlook, to contribute to the formation of expectations conducive to the gradual convergence of inflation during the following year.",
        "One member argued that, insofar as the process of economic normalization progresses, an increase in the global production of materials and inputs, a reestablishment of global value chains, and a decline in price pressures is anticipated.",
        "Another member pointed out that the global economy shifted from a sudden closure of activities, which caused businesses to reduce production capacity, to a scenario of vigorous spending expansion, with an irregular recovery and with significant disruptions in production.",
        "He/she underlined the recent slowdown in industrial production, especially in the manufacturing sectors that have very extended supply chains, which has propitiated multiple bottlenecks in production and adverse effects on prices.",
        "He/she added that the disruptions caused by the pandemic differ greatly from those observed in other crises, making it more difficult to identify their short- and medium-term effects.",
        "He/she mentioned that projections for economic activity, inflation and delinquency rates have not captured the effects of the pandemic and the challenges of the current juncture adequately.",

        "One member highlighted that this institution announced that it would maintain its stimulus until greater progress is made in achieving its mandates.",
        "He/she added that, in view of the various statements of its members, and given an environment of high uncertainty, financial markets anticipate that the Federal Reserve will announce a decrease in its asset purchase program this year and that it will begin increasing interest rates in 2022 and decline in expectations for the federal funds rate for the end of 2024, which has affected long-term rates in advanced economies.",
        "He/she delved into the fact that the effective, sustained, and coherent communication strategy followed by the Federal Reserve has contributed to the assimilation of its new monetary policy strategy’s highly accommodative tone by market participants, allowing news about the asset purchase program to have a limited impact on financial markets.",
        "Some members noted the importance of monitoring the Federal Reserve’s decisions.",
        "One member emphasized that it is necessary to adequately anticipate the evolution of the balance between the Fed’s goal of not inhibiting the recovery of the economy and of the labor market, and the need to respond to inflationary pressures unseen in decades, along with the difficulties in managing its balance sheet, which could affect the early withdrawal of its monetary stimulus.",
        "Some members added that the European Central Bank announced a symmetric inflation target, indicating that it could remain above 2% for some time.",

        "Another member stated that, despite the central banks’ commitment in advanced economies, except Canada, to maintain accommodative monetary policy stances for a long period, the higher levels of inflation have raised concerns among analysts regarding the possibility that they would transition to a tighter policy stance earlier than expected.",
        "Some members pointed out that those advanced economies that previously and during the pandemic registered inflation levels below their central banks’ targets, have more room for maneuver and more time to begin withdrawing their stimuli.",
        "One member pointed out that, in the United States, this responds to structural factors, including demographic ones, which have contributed to reduce inflation, potential growth and the neutral interest rate, allowing for more patience in withdrawing the monetary stimulus.",
        "He/she added that in that economy, the atypically high levels of economic growth are also expected to be transitory, which has kept real interest rates at low and even negative levels throughout the entire yield curve.",
        "Another member argued that economies that registered inflation levels consistently above their targets during the health crisis, face greater restrictions and must act rapidly and decisively to attain the convergence of inflation to its target and to preserve their credibility.",
        "One member mentioned that this environment of gradual adjustment, and of a heterogeneous economic recovery with higher inflationary pressures, implies considerable challenges and risks that reduce the room for maneuver of fiscal and monetary policies in emerging economies.",

        "Some members pointed out that several central banks of emerging economies have reduced their monetary stimulus.",
        "One member highlighted that the monetary authorities of these economies have modified their narrative, acknowledging that inflationary pressures could be more severe and less transitory than anticipated, and that some authorities have even acted, or expect to do so, in order to avoid an impact on the price formation process.",
        "Another member stated that most central banks in emerging economies maintain highly accommodative policy stances and negative real interest rates.",
        "He/she mentioned that, although in most of these economies limited increases in interest rates are expected in the next 12 months, for most of them those adjustments will not substantially modify their accommodative policy stances.",

        "He/she added that the economic recovery is still incomplete, which is evident when observing levels of slack in different sectors of the Global Economic Activity Indicator (IGAE, for its Spanish acronym).",
        "Some members highlighted the difficulty of estimating slack in light of the adverse effects on productive capacity.",
        "One member considered that slack is not likely to be as ample because business closures and operating restrictions imply a lower potential production capacity.",
        "Most members highlighted that the economic recovery is expected to continue for the rest of the year.",
        "One member underlined that, given the advance in the vaccination process and the boost from external demand, growth forecasts for 2021 are expected to increase.",
        "Another member pointed out that consumer confidence, the wage bill, light vehicle sales, and sales reported by the National Retailers Association of Mexico (ANTAD, for its Spanish acronym) have started to decelerate, which could indicate a moderation in growth in the second half of the industrial sector could affect GDP by more than one percentage point if these problems persist until the end of the year.",

        "He/she added that some analyses show how, since the beginning of the pandemic, the global factor’s incidence on core inflation has been negative, while the incidence of the idiosyncratic component has been positive.",
        "Another member highlighted the recent increase in the prices of intermediate inputs for secondary sector activities.",
        "One member stated that, during 2021, the aforementioned effects and the lack of flexibility in production have predominated, which has reduced the resilience and capacity of supply to absorb a higher demand without exerting pressure on prices.",
        "He/she added that the current environment has been conducive for inflation to register multiple shocks.",
        "Another member stated that the contribution of import prices seems to explain to a greater extent the variation in core inflation and that given Mexico’s economic integration with the rest of the world, global inflation could be a limiting factor for the behavior of domestic inflation, especially if its main trade partner is registering high levels of inflation.",
        "Some members mentioned that inflation has also increased due to changes in household consumption patterns and that, after having declined significantly in 2020, some prices are in a process of recovery in tandem with the gradual reopening.",

        "Some members pointed out the reduction in headline inflation in July versus previous months.",
        "One member stated that this result was due to a lower incidence of non-core inflation, which was partially offset by a higher incidence of core inflation.",
        "Another member mentioned that the new shocks have shaped inflation dynamics, offsetting the reductions stemming from arithmetic effects.",
        "He/she also noted that slack has had a diminishing effect in containing inflation.",
        "Regarding core inflation, most members pointed out that it shows an upward trend due to a recovery in the demand for services and to additional pressures on merchandise.",
        "Some members highlighted that more than 50% of core inflation’s components have registered variations higher than 4% in the last three months.",
        "One member stated that, according to an analysis of the inflationary process, pressures on the core component have tended to intensify, even after discounting the base effect.",
        "He/she stated that the moving averages of merchandise inflation are above currency market.",
        "Another member underlined that the above has taken place especially in the prices of said sub-index that are more susceptible to exchange rate pressures and to increases in energy prices.",
        "He/she highlighted that core inflation rates for May, June and July were the highest for similar months since 1999.",
        "He/she also added that the annualized monthly rates of inflation of food merchandise have registered levels around 10% in each of the three months.",
        "One member noted that, in July, more than 70% of the prices of the merchandise basket registered variations higher than 4%.",
        "Some members indicated that the non-core component decreased, supported by the decline in energy prices, which was partially offset by the higher variations of agricultural and livestock product prices.",
        "Most members pointed out that expectations for headline and core inflation for the end of 2021 rose again and highlighted their increase for 2022.",
        "Some members pointed out that medium-term expectations were revised upwards.",
        "Others stated that they remain anchored.",
        "One member indicated that the latter are relatively contained at levels above the target and that this outlook is conditional on expectations of increases in the reference rate, which is foreseen to reach 5% by the end of 2021 and 5.4% by the end of 2022.",
        "He/she also noted that business prospects point to input supply problems and to an increase in inflation expectations for the next 12 months.",
        "Another member warned that the increase in short- and medium-term expectations entails the risk of contagion to longer-term expectations and of them becoming unanchored.",
        "He/she expressed his/her concern of core inflation expectations continuing to deteriorate and being above the upper limit of the variability range.",
        "He/she added that nowadays there is a greater probability of headline inflation reaching levels higher than 6% and core inflation reaching levels above 5% by the end of the year.",
        "He/she highlighted that the mean and median of core inflation expectations remain above 3.5% until 2023.",
        "One member noted that medium- and long-term inflation expectations remain well anchored and that those derived from market instruments for the 6 to 10-year average are below there have been two major adjustments in these expectations, the first, in March, as a consequence of the increase in observed inflation, and the second, in June, after the monetary policy decision.",
        "One member stated that these expectations have increased less than in previous episodes of supply shocks.",
        "Another member highlighted the increase in compensation for expected inflation and inflation risk.",
        "He/she added that long-term expectations have remained anchored for some time at levels above the target.",
        "He/she said that they have remained stable during episodes of severe shocks.",
        "He/she considered that the resilience of these expectations is the result of Banco de México’s credibility, as it has firmly and consistently stated that it will take the actions available to achieve the convergence of inflation to the target.",
        "One member stated that shortterm expectations have been increasing since the previous monetary policy decision.",
        "Most members noted that the revised forecasts for the expected trajectories of headline and core inflation are higher than those published in the latest Quarterly Report.",
        "Some members added that convergence to the target is now expected to be achieved in the first quarter of 2023.",
        "One member mentioned that the inflation trajectory had been revised upwards in the June decision, and that from his/her view, he/she remained skeptical that said convergence would be reached in the period proposed on that occasion.",
        "At present, in the face of additional shocks with levels of inflation, unseen in many years, the forecasts have been revised upwards and its convergence within the forecast horizon has been postponed.",
        "Another member noted that the most recent adjustment in the forecasts with respect to estimates published in the Quarterly Report January-March 2021, presents increases of 90 basis points for headline inflation in the fourth quarter of 2021 and the second quarter of increased by 110 basis points in the fourth quarter of basis points in the fourth quarter of 2022.",
        "He/she also noted that these forecasts assume less accommodative monetary conditions over the forecast horizon.",
        "The majority of members pointed out that pressures on inflation are associated with shocks that are expected to be transitory.",
        "Nevertheless, the majority mentioned the risk that the price formation process is affected.",
        "One member considered that we can face shocks that might lead to knock-on effects with continuous pressures on prices of indefinite duration.",
        "Although these can be assimilated, we have to remain attentive so that they do not contaminate the formation of prices.",
        "He/she stated that the adjective expected trajectory of inflation.",
        "He/she pointed out that recent supply shocks, such as the lack of production inputs, could last longer than anticipated and that there are pressures associated with the reopening process, such as the increase in services prices.",
        "He/she warned that such shocks seem to have generalized effects, rather than on a few goods.",
        "Another member highlighted that several items have been affected by the pandemic and by factors associated with the current juncture, and considered that such effects will be transitory despite the uncertainty about their duration.",
        "One member stated that the higher levels of inflation are explained by three transitory phenomena that should not be a cause of concern: i) the reversion of prices to their former trend due to the reopening of activities, which explains why high inflation rates are temporarily being registered; ii) global shocks leading to increases in international prices of commodities and various industrial inputs, which have had an atypical impact on a few products that have a significant influence on inflation; and iii) the change in household consumption patterns and readjustments in relative prices.",
        "He/she added that, in some cases, price increases will reverse as normalization continues, while in others they will remain in place, although their effect will tend to fade gradually because they are one-time increases.",
        "Among upward risks to inflation, some members highlighted external inflationary pressures, especially from the United States.",
        "One member stated that these pressures are expected to continue to affect headline and core inflation in the second half of the year.",
        "Some members mentioned additional cost- related pressures.",
        "One member added the risks of core inflation’s high persistence, a depreciation of the peso, and increases in agricultural and livestock product prices.",
        "He/she mentioned that, as long as the pandemic does not fade, it is foreseeable that further impacts on prices will be observed.",
        "He/she added that, although rains have reduced pressures on agricultural and livestock product prices, the United States is facing a severe drought, which could affect prices in Mexico.",
        "Another member noted that commodity prices have shown greater stability, and thus the risk of greater inflationary pressures from this source has been mitigated.",
        "He/she pointed out that the exchange rate has remained stable and is not under pressure from deteriorating external accounts or public finances, while energy prices have reached stability and gas prices have even decreased.",
        "He/she indicated that the economy continues exhibiting ample levels of slack, so no demand pressures are anticipated.",
        "He/she added that no additional risks to inflation are foreseen beyond those that have already materialized.",
        "Some members mentioned as downward risks the effects stemming from the negative output gap, additional social distancing, and an appreciation of the peso.",
        "Most members considered the balance of risks to inflation within the forecast horizon to be biased Most members highlighted the stability of the peso exchange rate and its better performance compared to other emerging-market currencies.",
        "One member pointed out that open emerging economies are very sensitive to both global inflationary pressures and monetary and financial conditions in advanced economies, particularly in the United States.",
        "He/she stated that the baseline scenario incorporated by financial markets considers global effects on inflation, and patience in the response of the central banks of advanced economies.",
        "He/she pointed out that for emergingmarket economies such as Mexico, this implies first of all facing global inflationary pressures, and afterwards the tightening of global financial conditions, although there is still the risk of said adjustment occurring beforehand.",
        "Another member considered that the good performance of the Mexican peso was due to progress in the vaccination process, to an improvement in growth expectations, and to sound macroeconomic fundamentals.",
        "Some members noted the increase in interest rates, particularly for the shorter terms.",
        "One member added that, in line with the appreciation of the peso, Mexico's default premia improved.",
        "He/she mentioned that after the last monetary policy decision, one-year interest rates increased by as much as 75 basis points, well above the increase in the reference rate.",
        "He/she added that, in contrast to advanced economies, the long end of the yield curve also increased, and that the 10-year bond reached levels more than 30 basis points higher because of the market’s overreaction to the decision.",
        "Another member noted that the eventual process of monetary normalization at a global level could have implications for the exchange rate and for capital flows, which could present greater outflows than those observed at this point.",
        "Some members pointed out that the stock market registered gains.",
        "One member emphasized that a rating agency downgraded Pemex's credit rating once again, leaving it with a negative outlook.",
        "He/she added that according to the rating agency, despite the Federal Government's support, liquidity risk persists given the considerable requirements that the company will face due to its debt maturities, and highlighted the possible operational losses it would suffer due to the expansion of its refining capacity.",
        "He/she considered that the above shows the deterioration of its financial situation and represents a risk for public finances and the government securities market.",
        "The majority of members noted that private unfavorably, and mentioned the fall in lending to firms.",
        "Some members noted that this was due to a tightening in banks' lending standards.",
        "One member added that it also responds to lower debt issuance.",
        "Another member mentioned that credit to Small- and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) contracted and showed no signs of improvement.",
        "Some members observed that consumer credit continued to decline and that mortgage lending has grown at a more moderate pace.",
        "One member noted that, in some sectors, credit has fallen by more than 20% as compared to pre-pandemic levels and that a contraction is observed, even in sectors that did not experience a recession.",
        "Another member pointed out that, in the second quarter, total sources of financing declined for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic, after having reached high and increasing annual flows.",
        "He/she added that this is explained by the fall in domestic sources of financing.",
        "One member stated that this is a matter of concern, given the relevance of credit for the recovery, and that it would be desirable to avoid a premature and counterproductive tightening of financial conditions in the face of the fragile recovery.",
        "Most members of Banco de México’s Governing Board pointed out that, due to the variety, magnitude, and the extended horizon over which the shocks have affected inflation, they may pose a risk to the price formation process.",
        "For this reason, most members deemed necessary to strengthen the monetary policy stance by increasing the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 25 basis points to 4.50%, in order to avoid adverse effects on inflation expectations and enable an orderly adjustment of relative prices.",
        "Most members highlighted that, in the next monetary policy decisions, the Governing Board will assess the factors that have an incidence on inflation, on its foreseen trajectory expectations.",
        "This, in order for the policy rate to be consistent with the orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to the 3% target, within the time frame in which monetary policy operates, and enable an adequate adjustment of the economy and financial One member noted that, in view of the unexpected monetary policy decision of June, there was a significant adjustment to the level of the reference rate for the end of the year anticipated by both markets and analysts.",
        "He/she expressed his/her view that this is not consistent with Banco de México’s forecasts, nor with the communication released regarding the strengthening of monetary policy that the majority of the Governing Board opted for in the previous decision.",
        "He/she argued that bringing the policy rate closer to the levels expected by analysts and markets may imply tightening financial conditions more than required.",
        "He/she noted that, although such an increase would appear to leave the rate at its neutral level, there is currently no certainty that this level has changed due to the pandemic.",
        "He/she added that the lower end of the estimated range for the neutral rate may suggest to stop the rate increases before the levels that markets are expecting for the end of the year are reached.",
        "He/she pointed out that validating an upward cycle would aim at containing inflationary pressures on sources that are not necessarily monetary, so its success would require the contraction of prices whose inflation is already within the target or that are undergoing a recovery process.",
        "He/she considered that Banco de México's best contribution is keeping inflation expectations anchored, and for that purpose, the reference rate, which is the ideal instrument, is not the only instrument.",
        "It also has its communication, which must play a key role in times of uncertainty, when a timely, gradual and prudent monetary policy stance must be maintained.",
        "He/she stated that it continues to be relevant to point out that the decrease in inflation might synchronize with the horizon in which monetary policy operates, causing the mechanism of incidence of the policy stance to operate precisely at the moment when it would be least useful.",
        "He/she argued that, looking ahead, Banco de México must remain attentive to the evolution of commodity prices, the announcement of reductions in the Fed’s asset purchases, and to market trading conditions.",
        "Another member stated that, given the broad consensus about the transitory nature of the rise in inflation, keeping the reference rate unchanged would not jeopardize the convergence process.",
        "He/she pointed out that the central bank's decisions and communication affect the beliefs about the evolution of inflation, and unexpected decisions affect their expectations.",
        "He/she argued that the origin of observed inflation should be explained, reiterating its transitory nature, which would give a signal of tranquility.",
        "He/she highlighted that this policy would be similar to that used by other central banks and to the one used by Banco de México when facing the supply shocks of 2012.",
        "He/she added that a pause would allow to continue granting stimulus to economic activity.",
        "He/she indicated that it is not advisable for central banks to respond to supply shocks as they cannot affect them directly.",
        "He/she pointed out that an increase in the reference rate has a generalized and negative impact on investment, consumption, employment, credit, and public finances.",
        "He/she mentioned that, prior to the consolidation of the anchoring of expectations, it was logical to respond to supply shocks.",
        "However, Banco de México’s actions allowed an anchoring of expectations and since the episode of 2012, it was no longer necessary to increase the rate because the control of inflation and its expectations was achieved with effective and consistent communication.",
        "In the episode of 2017, gasoline prices increased sharply, in a context of exchange rate depreciation and deteriorated external and fiscal accounts.",
        "He/she highlighted that the change in pricing policy worked as a coordination mechanism, which affected expectations.",
        "He/she added that in the current scenario, gasoline prices and the exchange rate remain stable, there is fiscal discipline and a trade surplus, and long-term inflation expectations remain anchored.",
        "He/she noted that the current conditions are more similar to those of 2012 than to those of similar to the former.",
        "In his/her opinion it is not convenient to bring forward what could be interpreted as a cycle of normalization.",
        "He/she mentioned that the Fed is expected to begin the normalization process of its reference rate around mid-2023 and, thus, closing the relative position and bringing the local interest rate into neutral territory prematurely may have an impact on future macroeconomic and financial stability.",
        "One member pointed out that with an inflation gap of three percentage points, if the reference rate is not increased, there would be no convergence in the foreseen horizon.",
        "He/she pointed out that progress in economic activity suggests the presence of a less amount of slack, which opens the possibility of strengthening the monetary policy stance without widening slack conditions.",
        "Also, given that the problem of measuring economic indicators persists, the output gap could be smaller than estimated, which reinforces the proposal of increasing the monetary policy reference rate.",
        "He/she explained that a reference rate of 4.50% is still an expansionary policy stance and lays below headline and core inflation figures.",
        "He/she considered that, at these levels, the ex-post real rate will remain negative until low levels.",
        "He/she noted that monetary policy cannot affect supply shocks directly, but that actions should be taken against inflationary shocks regardless of their nature, in order to avoid second-round effects.",
        "A preventive adjustment reinforces the expectation that such effects will not be allowed.",
        "He/she expressed that one of the main transmission channels is the expectations channel, and that an image of complacency should be avoided.",
        "He/she argued that the success of the inflation-targeting regime resides in central banks not sacrificing the inflationary objective to achieve short-term growth targets.",
        "He/she highlighted that an interest rate trajectory that minimizes inflation and output gaps should be chosen.",
        "He/she pointed out that an optimal trajectory revolves around expectations that monetary policy will keep inflation stable and close to its target in the long term.",
        "He/she emphasized that overreactions in markets should be avoided, given that they may anticipate aggressive increases.",
        "Thus, it should be emphasized that inflation forecasts show a delay in the convergence to the target, which indicates that an additional strengthening of the monetary policy stance is needed, but does not necessarily imply an accelerated cycle of interest rate increases.",
        "He/she added that Banco de México must effectively communicate its reaction function and that its forward guidance should have clarity regarding three aspects of the interest rate’s trajectory: its directionality, the magnitude of possible adjustments, and the timing of their implementation.",
        "He/she pointed out that, given the slack conditions, the inflationary outlook and the transitory shocks, it would appear that the new monetary policy stance may be sufficient for the time being and that further rate adjustments will depend exclusively on incoming data.",
        "Another member argued that, given the complex environment, it is essential for Banco de México to act in a timely and decisive manner to reaffirm its commitment to its primary mandate.",
        "He/she stated that, failure to do so would require sharper adjustments in the future, with greater costs in terms of output and employment.",
        "He/she recalled that, although inflationary pressures are mostly, although not exclusively, explained by supply shocks, for which monetary policy has a limited scope of action, it is essential to strengthen the expectations channel, in order to avoid second-round effects, contamination of the price formation process, and to prevent an impact on the anchoring of expectations.",
        "He/she emphasized that the monetary policy action adopted, both in terms of magnitude and operating channel, does not seek to solve the effects of supply shocks, but is rather a fundamental signal that reinforces the commitment of convergence to the target.",
        "He/she warned that this is the central element in an inflationforecast targeting regime, and that renouncing to this commitment means losing sense of the central bank’s mandate.",
        "He/she highlighted that, given the still weak performance of the labor market, investment and domestic financing, and given the effects of the pandemic on inequality, Banco de México’s role in achieving price stability is of vital importance to avoid worsening the situation of the most vulnerable part of the population, which suffers the effects of high inflation to a greater extent.",
        "One member considered it essential for Banco de México to show and reinforce its commitment to its constitutional mandate to protect the purchasing power of the national currency.",
        "He/she pointed out that this is particularly important when considering the significant upward revisions to headline and core inflation forecasts, and that the outlook for economic activity reveals a faster growth rate and is likely to be revised upwards.",
        "He/she highlighted that since the target for the interbank interest rate has been used as the monetary policy instrument, it has been below core inflation on only three occasions: i) in 2009 during the global financial crisis, when core inflation was following a rapid downward trajectory; ii) in 2014 when core inflation was close to the target; and iii) from March to July 2021, when core inflation followed an upward trend for more than five months, deviating considerably from the target.",
        "He/she stated that maintaining a distinctly accommodative monetary policy stance and tolerating high inflation levels well above the target, could lead to a de-anchoring of price formation, erode Banco de México’s credibility, and exert pressure on inflationary risk premia, thus increasing the financial cost of all economic agents, to the detriment of a sustained recovery.",
        "He/she argued that, although the shocks that have affected inflation are expected to be transitory, considering the simultaneity, magnitude and the extended horizon over which the shocks have affected headline and core inflation, as well as the high levels they have reached, there is a risk that the price formation process is affected.",
        "For that reason, it is essential to strengthen the monetary policy stance to keep medium and long-term inflation expectations anchored and enable a decreasing trend of inflation towards its target.",
        "Some members pointed out that Banco de México's decision to publish inflation forecasts improves its communication channel.",
        "One member added that this is an exercise of transparency and accountability that puts the Central Bank at the forefront of communication.",
        "Although the shocks that have increased inflation are expected to be transitory, due to their variety, magnitude, and the extended horizon over which they have affected it, they may pose risks to the price formation process.",
        "For this reason, it was deemed necessary to strengthen the monetary policy stance in order to avoid adverse effects on inflation expectations and enable an orderly adjustment of relative prices and the convergence of inflation to the the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by For the next monetary policy decisions, the Governing Board will assess the factors that have an incidence on inflation, on its foreseen trajectory within the forecast horizon, and on its expectations.",
        "This, in order for the policy rate to be consistent with the orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to the 3% target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates, and enable an adequate adjustment of the economy and financial markets.",
        "Alejandro Díaz de León, Irene Espinosa, and Jonathan Heath voted in favor of increasing the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 25 basis points to 4.50%.",
        "Galia Borja and Gerardo Esquivel voted in favor of leaving the target for the overnight interbank interest rate unchanged at In the present conditions, I believe that increasing the target for the overnight interbank interest rate would validate interest rate expectations for the end of the year, associated with a controversial communication in June’s decision.",
        "In my opinion, validating said expectations does not clarify the meaning of strengthening the monetary policy stance, could lead to a dynamic inconsistency in future decisions, and may imply a greater-than-necessary tightening of local financial conditions.",
        "In my opinion, inflation is being affected mainly by global inflation, as well as by distortions generated by the pandemic, such as bottlenecks, changes in consumption patterns, the recovery of prices, and multifactor elements related to weather conditions.",
        "Although there is little certainty as to how long these factors will last due to the unprecedented situation we are facing, I still believe these will be transitory in nature.",
        "In an environment of high uncertainty, opting for a policy stance based on gradual decisions allows to establish a better communication and avoids mistaking a strengthening with a cycle of interest rate increases, given that the end of this strengthening may coincide with a tightening of international financial and monetary conditions, in which it will probably be necessary to have more room for the use of monetary policy.",
        "There is broad consensus regarding the predominantly transitory nature of worldwide inflationary pressures.",
        "For this reason, and because an interest rate increase would have no effect on inflation stemming from supply shocks, I believe that maintaining the reference rate does not jeopardize the convergence of inflation to its target.",
        "On the contrary, raising it again could send the wrong signal that the current inflation is of a more permanent nature, which in turn could affect short- and mediumterm expectations, as well as the price formation process.",
        "It should be kept in mind that the central bank's decisions and communication constitute a signal that affects economic agents' expectations.",
        "In this regard, I believe that, in the current context, the appropriate policy is to maintain the reference rate and explain with greater detail the origin and causes of observed inflation, reiterating its transitory nature.",
        "A strategy based on a careful and coherent communication is being used by other central banks in the present situation and was successfully used by Banco de México in 2012 in the face of similar supply shocks.",
        "Most members mentioned that global economic activity continued to recover at a more moderate and heterogeneous rate across countries and sectors.",
        "Some members stated that the global economy’s dynamism is reflected in the recovery of international trade and industrial production.",
        "One member noted that the rate of recovery has been greater than anticipated by most analysts.",
        "Another member pointed out that the economic recession in added that social distancing measures led to changes in consumption patterns, labor relations, production processes, supply chains and human capital formation.",
        "He/she emphasized that fiscal and monetary authorities have taken measures to preserve economic stability.",
        "One member stated that the performance of the economies is associated with the severity of the effects from the pandemic and with the differences in the relief programs.",
        "In this regard, he/she noted that the countries that received more support in 2020 registered smaller contractions than originally estimated.",
        "Most members stated that the global economy is expected to continue recovering in 2021 in view of the foreseen progress in vaccination strategies and of the fiscal and monetary stimuli.",
        "Some members considered that differences in these factors could lead to a heterogeneous recovery across countries and regions.",
        "Most members underlined the improvement in the global growth forecasts for 2021.",
        "Some members indicated that IMF projections point to a 5.5% expansion for this year.",
        "In this regard, one member noted that within advanced economies only the United States would manage to offset in 2021 the fall registered in 2020.",
        "He/she added that, within emerging economies, estimates of a fast recovery for Asia contrast with those for Latin America, which is expected to recover at a slower rate.",
        "Most members highlighted the risks for global economic growth associated with the evolution of the pandemic and the measures to contain it, in particular, the recent implementation of new mobility restrictions in various countries.",
        "One member considered that this has exerted greater pressures on vaccine production and distribution and on relief measures for households and firms.",
        "In this context, another member considered that the aforementioned countries will continue to show economic weakness during the first quarter of the year.",
        "He/she added as risks: i) the significant increase in government and corporate debt; ii) an increase in bankruptcies of firms affected by the pandemic; iii) the imbalances in stock markets; and iv) the intensification of geopolitical and social conflicts.",
        "He/she considered that, given the high level of uncertainty, the balance of risks for global growth remains biased to the downside.",
        "Most members stated that inflation in advanced economies remains below their central banks’ targets.",
        "One member noted that in some of these economies inflation has accelerated.",
        "Some members pointed out that in advanced economies inflation is anticipated to remain at low levels, although one member added that in 2021 and 2022 it is expected to begin converging to its target.",
        "In the case of the United States, some members mentioned that, in view of the fiscal and monetary stimulus programs, inflation expectations have been revised upwards.",
        "One member highlighted that these are at levels above those registered a year ago.",
        "Another member mentioned the heterogeneous behavior of inflation, where in early February the expected 5-year average inflation in five years in the United States exceeded 2.3%, while, in contrast, in the euro area and Japan it registers 1.34 and -0.13%, respectively.",
        "Some members noted that in emerging economies inflation has exhibited a heterogeneous behavior, although one member highlighted that it is at relatively low levels.",
        "Another member pointed out that in some of these economies upward pressures persist due to the higher food prices, the supply shock and foreign exchange depreciation.",
        "One member mentioned that, in emerging economies, inflation rates are estimated to be below their historic average figures.",
        "On the other hand, most members mentioned that commodity prices rose.",
        "Some members underlined that this was due to the increase in oil prices, which responded to an improvement in the growth outlook.",
        "One member added that inventory figures for US crude oil also contributed to the aforementioned.",
        "All members mentioned that the central banks of advanced economies reiterated their intention to maintain accommodative monetary policy stances for an extended period.",
        "One member pointed out that the federal funds rate is anticipated to remain unchanged in 2021 and 2022.",
        "He/she added that the new monetary strategy of the Federal Reserve will allow inflation to be above 2% for a certain time and to maintain low or negative real interest rates for a longer period.",
        "As for emerging economies, he/she mentioned that their respective central banks continued to maintain accommodative policy stances, with a negative ex-ante real interest rate in most cases.",
        "He/she indicated that most central banks of emerging economies are expected to maintain their reference rates unchanged during Most members highlighted the expectation that fiscal stimulus in advanced economies is extended.",
        "Some members recalled the case of the United States.",
        "One member pointed out that the results of the electoral process in the United States have favored this expectation for that country.",
        "Most members agreed that global financial markets have exhibited a positive behavior mainly in view of expectations of a large fiscal stimulus package in the United States.",
        "Some members noted that the mitigation of political factors also contributed to the above.",
        "In this regard, one member mentioned that this evolution was affected by the final stage of the electoral process in the United States.",
        "and by the agreement on the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union.",
        "Some members added the progress in the vaccination process in different countries.",
        "In this context, one member mentioned that market optimism has contributed to the decline in credit risk premia.",

        "One member mentioned that the US dollar fluctuated in a narrow range and that portfolio flows concentrated in the Asian region.",
        "Another member added that emerging economies’ currencies appreciated and that, looking ahead, financial markets are expected to continue exhibiting positive behavior given the progress in the vaccination process, the reopening of economic activities, and the continuation of fiscal and monetary stimuli.",
        "One member noted, from a medium-term perspective, that since the beginning of the pandemic capital flows to emerging economies as well as the terms and conditions of access to markets have been influenced by: i) the favorable trend of global risk appetite; ii) liquidity conditions and the evolution of the yield curve in the US market; and iii) the recent measures to integrate China’s financial sector to international markets.",
        "Regarding the second factor, he/she stated that international markets have benefitted from the Federal Reserve’s support measures, which granted ample liquidity, leading to a marked reduction in interest rates.",
        "However, he/she added that longer-term rates have rebounded in view of the outlook for greater fiscal stimuli.",
        "As for the third factor, he/she pointed out that China’s inclusion in global fixed income indices, along with interest rates above those in other economies and a lower foreign exchange risk, have contributed to a significant recomposition of capital flows to that economy.",
        "He/she stated that the above poses challenges to emerging economies, given that global financial conditions operate as an additional restriction on the domestic adjustment of these economies, which also face multiple pandemic-related challenges and a limited margin of maneuver for policy implementation.",
        "Some members considered that international financial markets are subject to different risks, especially the abovementioned related to global activity.",

        "One member added that available information suggests that activity will have shown a decline in early 2021 and that this situation is consistent with the recent intensification of the pandemic.",
        "Regarding demand, all members emphasized that the recovery has been driven mostly by the external sector.",
        "Most members highlighted the differentiated performance of imports and exports, highlighting the positive performance of the latter, particularly manufacturing exports.",
        "Some members mentioned that in December these grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 8.84%.",

        "One member mentioned that, at a sectoral level, the primary sector exhibited a favorable performance in 2020, by growing 2% in annual terms, while the secondary sector was the one that fell the most, followed by the tertiary sector.",
        "However, he/she mentioned that secondary activities have recovered faster than tertiary ones.",
        "Another member stated that, after contracting markedly in April, industrial production has been recovering, and as of November has accumulated six months with positive monthly variations, registering an annual contraction of 3.25% in said month.",

        "One member mentioned that at the end of 2020 there were 19 million individuals in need of a full-time job, 2.1 million of which corresponded to open unemployment, 9.4 million were in disguised unemployment, and 7.5 million were underemployed.",
        "He/she added that, although the extended unemployment rate has decreased significantly since April, it was 17.9% in December, a level above those registered in previous crises.",
        "He/she underlined that the pandemic has intensified the precarious situation of the labor market, mainly affecting low-wage earners, women and young people.",
        "He/she mentioned that these figures point to a significant decline in households’ disposable income, a determining factor in the difficulty for regaining their consumption levels.",
        "Another member mentioned that, between February and April of 2020, the total employment rate decreased by 12.5 million jobs.",
        "He/she added that, although it increased by 9.7 million between May and October, it fell once again by 130,000 jobs between November and December.",

        "The majority of members agreed that an uncertain environment with downward risks to economic activity persists, due mainly to the evolution of the pandemic.",
        "One member stated that the number of monthly infections and deaths associated with the pandemic reached a maximum level in January and that there are no signs that this pattern will decrease soon.",
        "He/she highlighted that it would take time to achieve the necessary percentage of vaccination coverage required to return to normality.",
        "He/she added that, given the scarcity of vaccines and the logistical problems associated with their distribution, in the best-case scenario the impact of vaccination would be noticeable towards the end of the year, which could lead to irreversible damage for many firms.",
        "Another member underlined the importance of considering the possible impact of the pandemic on the productive apparatus in order to be able to estimate the effects on potential growth.",
        "One member highlighted as risks to growth: i) the negative effects on the inputs supply for production; ii) the volatility of financial markets; iii) the deterioration of the credit portfolio quality; iv) lower public revenues that may affect the sovereign risk outlook and the conditions of access to financial markets; and v) more elements of uncertainty affecting investment.",

        "As for downward risks to inflation, some members mentioned the possibility of a decline in prices due to the depth and persistence of slack in the economy, as well as a foreign exchange rate appreciation.",
        "One member added that said appreciation might be due to a greater risk appetite by investors or to an improvement in the perception of Mexico’s fiscal position.",

        "Nevertheless, some members considered that Mexico's fiscal policy, unlike other economies, has maintained a manageable debt level, which is a positive element for macroeconomic stability.",
        "One member noted that the fiscal position and the favorable performance of inflation in the last two years reveal the authorities' commitment to preserve economic fundamentals.",
        "He/she noted that Mexico’s fiscal position has been favored in relative terms due to the levels of indebtedness of most countries in 2020, in contrast with those observed in the country.",
        "He/she mentioned that according to structural indicators of public finances, such as the budgetary balance and the public debt-to-GDP ratio, Mexico will emerge from the pandemic in a better condition than other emerging economies, and even better than countries with higher credit ratings.",
        "However, another member argued that while efforts to have a responsible fiscal balance are valuable, it would be desirable to observe, within the limits of fiscal responsibility, a budgetary reallocation that would allow for meeting the contingent needs.",
        "Most members mentioned that financing to the private sector continued to decline.",
        "One member noted that this was due to less debt issuance and lower bank lending.",

        "Another member stated that as of December 2020, consumer financing contracted by -8.1% in annual terms while corporate financing did so by -4.3%.",
        "He/she considered it worrisome that credit to SMEs remains stagnant without showing signs of recovery at the margin.",
        "He/she pointed out that this could be due to supply factors and to credit terms that apparently continue to be unattractive.",
        "He/she mentioned that although development banks have implemented guarantee programs to support credit to firms, a considerable amount of these stimuli have remained unallocated.",
        "One member stated that, according to Banco de México’s Survey on General Conditions and Standards in the Banking Credit Market (EnBan, for its acronym in Spanish), credit approval expectations for the first quarter of 2021 foresee a tightening.",
        "However, he/she mentioned that interest rates associated with bank credit have followed the behavior of the bank funding rate, which influences the credit conditions for households and firms.",
        "He/she added that domestic sources of financial resources remained at high levels during the fourth quarter of 2020.",
        "Another member highlighted the predominance of domestic sources of financing over external ones and the increase in financing to the public sector.",
        "One member underlined the need for a firm macroeconomic strategy that generates confidence, promotes an orderly adjustment of the national economy to the shocks that have affected it, and fosters the proper functioning of domestic financial markets and of the financial system.",
        "Another member noted that the sluggish behavior of private investment observed since 2018 mainly responds to institutional and structural factors.",
        "He/she considered that economic reactivation necessarily requires actions in the field of the rule of law, legal certainty, security and the fight against corruption and impunity.",
        "He/she highlighted three events that have affected investor’s confidence: i) the initiative to modify Banco de México’s Law.",
        "In this regard, he/she mentioned that although the new measures announced aim to solve the problems referred to in this initiative, its risks may not dissipate while its discussion in the legislative branch continues; ii) the preferential initiative on the Electricity Sector Law, which modifies the current contract terms and cancels the transition to clean energies; and iii) the suspension of the highway project tenders currently underway.",
        "Considering that incoming information allows for adjusting the reference rate, while maintaining inflation forecasts in line with the trajectory converging towards the central bank's target, all members agreed to lower the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 25 basis points to a level of 4.00%.",
        "Looking ahead, the majority of members pointed out that monetary policy implementation will depend on the evolution of the factors that have an incidence on headline and core inflation, on their foreseen One member argued that, considering the magnitude of the supply, demand and financial shocks related to the pandemic, monetary policy in emerging economies, such as Mexico's, should contribute to maintain inflation at low levels around its target, promote the proper functioning of financial markets and financial system stability, and contribute to a sustained economic recovery.",
        "He/she pointed out that in order to achieve this, it is important that the behavior of interest rates along the yield curve leads to an orderly adjustment in the different expenditure items, in domestic financial markets, and in external capital flows.",
        "He/she stated that such adjustment must consider the relevant external financial conditions and the behavior of medium- and long-term domestic risk premia.",
        "He/she emphasized that for emerging economies, such as Mexico's, which need to complement their domestic savings with external sources of financing, it is important to maintain a stable macroeconomic environment in order to attract and retain capital, as well as to have the necessary financial conditions for an orderly adjustment of the economy.",
        "He/she considered that in the context of shocks associated with the pandemic, exchange rate depreciation, fiscal pressures and uncertainty regarding sovereign credit ratings, one of the greatest challenges for monetary policy has been to allow for an adjustment of relative prices, avoiding a deterioration of inflation expectations and the price formation process, as well as second-round effects, in order to maintain a sustained low and stable inflation and reduce inflationary risk premia.",
        "He/she pointed out the importance of facilitating a foreign exchange adjustment so that, after dampening the significant financial shock, it remained orderly, and would also lead to a partial reversion of the initial impact, thus contributing to an adjustment of the economy under better conditions.",
        "He/she argued that this strategy has allowed for lower interest rates along the entire yield curve and highlighted that reductions in long-term interest rates in Mexico compare favorably with those of other emerging economies.",
        "Finally, he/she pointed out that risks for inflation, economic activity and financial markets pose major challenges for monetary policy and the economy in general.",
        "Another member mentioned that, based on available information, the determinants of price increases in the country are in line with the orderly and sustained convergence of inflation to its target.",
        "He/she added that medium- and long-term inflation expectations from Banco de México's latest survey do not indicate an upward trajectory, while breakeven inflation and inflation risk implicit in market instruments have remained stable, which indicates that inflation expectations remain well-anchored.",
        "He/she pointed out that the pause that took place allowed for confirming the fading of inflationary pressures that were present in the middle of last year as a result of supply-, demand- and financial-related shocks.",
        "He/she pointed out that information available in January 2021 as well as the future outlook do not suggest an increasing price dynamic that would lead to a breach of the price stability mandate.",
        "He/she stated that, therefore, on this occasion, there is a specific window of opportunity, within the time frame in which monetary policy operates, that allows for reducing the intrinsic costs in the financial system and in economic activity that arise from maintaining a restrictive monetary policy stance in an economic scenario with ample slack conditions.",
        "One member pointed out that the evolution of inflation and its expectations, as well as an uncertain balance of risks, impose challenges for estimating the future trajectory of inflation and for monetary policy implementation, and that for this reason it is crucial to follow a risk management approach that favors prudence.",
        "He/she recalled that the pause was extended in December to confirm whether inflation, mainly core inflation, had started following a downward trend.",
        "In this regard, he/she considered that given that the recent increase in inflation is due to the non-core subindex, that a more moderate recovery is expected in the first half of the year, that the balance of risks for activity continues to be biased to the downside and that the exchange rate remains relatively stable, there is some margin of maneuver to lower the rate without compromising the convergence of inflation to the target.",
        "However, he/she noted that significant risks persist, such as the vulnerability of public finances and possible episodes of volatility, which could affect the peso exchange rate and have an impact on inflation.",
        "Regarding the exchange rate, he/she considered that factors such as the sovereign rating downgrade, the electoral process in June and domestic public policies that generate uncertainty could exert exchange rate pressures and impose greater stress on the monetary policy stance.",
        "He/she pointed out that the limits of monetary policy must be acknowledged because, although an accommodative policy stance can help to reactivate the economy, it is not enough by itself.",
        "He/she stated that under the current circumstances, it is difficult to assume that an additional monetary policy easing would result in a significant boost to economic activity.",
        "In this regard, he/she recalled that between basis points to a level of 8.25% and it was at that point when gross private investment reached its peak, while from that time up to now it has contracted policy’s room for maneuver to boost consumption is limited in the absence of fiscal support to avoid the closing of companies, job losses and the consequent decrease in credit to households and firms, especially SMEs, due to the increase in risk perception of financial institutions.",
        "The monetary policy implemented by Banco de México, both through the reference rate and the measures to provide liquidity and facilitate credit lending, has contributed to confront the shocks derived from the pandemic within the scope of its competence.",
        "Finally, he/she emphasized that the present monetary policy decision does not compromise the downward trajectory of inflation and pointed out that in the current environment of high uncertainty, this decision does not constitute a guide for future actions.",
        "In his/her opinion, the most effective tool to facilitate the orderly adjustment of the economy to real shocks is to underpin public confidence in future monetary policy decisions maintaining price stability as their priority.",
        "Another member considered that the reduction in the reference rate can contribute to strengthen the economic recovery without jeopardizing the inflation target.",
        "He/she added that this reduction should not be interpreted as the end of monetary easing, since several indicators suggest that such easing is still insufficient.",
        "He/she pointed out that Mexico is one of the few economies in the world with a positive ex-ante real interest rate.",
        "He/she highlighted that in most central banks in both advanced and emerging economies lowered their reference rates during 2020 significantly, reaching, in many cases, negative real rates.",
        "He/she pointed out that while the ex-ante real interest rate in Chile is around -2.5% and in Colombia it is -1%, in Mexico it is between 0.75% and over 1%, depending on the measure used to calculate expected inflation.",
        "He/she also mentioned that the components of aggregate demand that usually depend on the level of interest rates are those that currently exhibit the worst performance.",
        "He/she highlighted that i) light vehicle sales contracted 20% in annual terms; ii) credit card purchases remain 10% below their expected level; iii) credit to SMEs contracted 8% in real annual terms; and iv) investment in November 2020 was in real terms 12% lower than during the same period of 2019.",
        "In this regard, he/she considered that the need for further monetary easing is evidenced by the difference in the recovery rates of domestic demand in relation to external demand.",
        "He/she mentioned that domestic demand remains weak, while external demand has recovered rapidly and that this difference is due to the fact that the former is directly affected by domestic monetary policy, which still remains restrictive in relation to the economic conditions, while the latter is benefited by the fiscal and monetary stimuli in other economies.",
        "He/she emphasized that the ex-ante real interest rate is important for investment and consumption decisions.",
        "He/she argued that during a recession, if this rate does not decrease sufficiently to stimulate aggregate demand, there is a risk of deepening and prolonging a fragile economic situation with the consequent economic and social costs.",
        "Finally, he/she considered that the Governing Board must remain attentive to a new opportunity to continue the monetary easing process.",
        "One member pointed out that further monetary easing is still needed to support the economic recovery.",
        "He/she noted that given the lack of fiscal support, the recessionary situation and the anticipated slow recovery, monetary easing should continue although he/she acknowledged that monetary policy is not the ideal instrument to drive the recovery.",
        "He/she noted that the absolute and relative monetary policy stances still allow for some room to lower the reference rate.",
        "He/she stated that the highly accommodative monetary policy worldwide, lower risk aversion and the low level of the neutral short-term interest rate favor low domestic rates.",
        "He/she pointed out that the fiscal stance does not represent a risk for price stability, since maintaining a conservative stance on public prices even serves to relieve pressures on inflation.",
        "He/she mentioned that although the fiscal stance has not been counter-cyclical, there will not be excessive indebtedness as in other countries, which will contribute to relieve pressures on the exchange rate and promote the sound development of financial markets.",
        "He/she considered that the benefits of a more accommodative stance are increasingly marginal and that this could have undesirable consequences for financial stability.",
        "He/she added that one constraint to credit growth is its weak demand for investment projects in the face of factors unrelated to monetary policy, such as the economic slack and the environment of uncertainty.",
        "He/she pointed out that an excessively loose stance reduces the incentive to save, the availability of funds for investment and the profitability of the banking system, which may lead to a relaxation of credit standards.",
        "He/she mentioned that lowering the reference rate may distort the risk calibration implicit in the prices of firms' financial assets by artificially increasing the valuation of those that are not profitable.",
        "He/she also expressed concern that the reduction in inflation has mostly been due to the non-core component, rather than the core component, despite the ample amount of slack in the economy.",
        "He/she pointed out that an increase in average wages is anticipated, this in the context of a reduction in corporate profits, and that inflation expectations are above target, which reflects the risk of them unanchoring.",
        "He/she emphasized that in view of the foreseen temporary increase in the trajectory of inflation in the coming months, caution is required when assessing the convenience of increasing the pace of monetary easing.",
        "He/she stated that unfortunately the opportunity to intensify the accommodative policy stance in November and December was missed, and that there is a last window of opportunity to implement a greater monetary policy loosening aimed at mitigating the effects of the economic recession, before facing a period that promises to be difficult.",
        "He/she considered that, over the next few months, actions must be taken cautiously, given that under the current conditions, monetary policy may be limited once more, with significant risks for the unanchoring of inflation expectations and for the central banks credibility.",
        "In this context, he/she pointed out that a pause may become more necessary as time passes by and that this decision will be the result of a careful reflection, before the inflation bubble that is anticipated for the second quarter arises, and in a scenario in which a lower persistence in inflation compared to the projected trajectory is not observed.",
        "He/she added that there is now a window of opportunity for a further monetary easing, which will help to mitigate the effects of the recession, before facing a period that will be difficult.",
        "The risks for inflation, economic activity and financial markets pose major challenges for monetary policy and for the economy.",
        "In this regard, it is necessary to enable an orderly adjustment that allows for a change in relative prices, without affecting the price formation process and inflation expectations.",
        "Considering that incoming information allows for a monetary policy adjustment, while maintaining inflation forecasts in line with the converging trajectory to the 3% target, with the presence of all its members, the Governing Board decided unanimously to lower the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 25 basis points to a level of implementation will depend on the evolution of the factors that have an incidence on headline and core inflation, on their foreseen trajectories within the forecast horizon, and on their expectations.",
        "The Governing Board will take the necessary actions based on incoming information in order for the policy rate to be consistent with the orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to the 3% target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates.",
        "It is necessary to safeguard the institutional framework, strengthen the macroeconomic fundamentals and adopt the necessary actions on both monetary and fiscal policy fronts, to enable a better adjustment of domestic financial markets and of the economy as a whole.",
        "Alejandro Díaz de León-Carrillo, Galia Borja-Gómez, Irene Espinosa-Cantellano, Gerardo Esquivel-Hernández and Jonathan Ernest Heath-Constable voted in favor of lowering the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 25 basis points to 4.00%.",
        "The majority mentioned that global economic activity continued to recover, although at a countries and sectors, associated with vaccine availability, the evolution of the pandemic, and shortage of inputs has contributed to a deceleration of industrial and manufacturing production.",
        "One member stated that retail sales and purchasing managers’ indices also show signs of moderation.",
        "He/she added that in several countries, output and employment gaps remain negative, particularly in emerging economies with a tighter fiscal and monetary space.",
        "Another member added that the global economy continues to be affected by the effects of the pandemic: i) the health challenge associated with infections and the vaccination process; ii) the heterogeneity in the recovery; iii) the differences among countries regarding the space available to incentivize spending; iv) the transition from an abrupt shutdown of activities to a vigorous expansion in a short period of time, which intensified the impact on the supply chains for goods’ production and generated an irregular pace in the recovery of services; and v) a profound reallocation of spending, with increases in consumption of durable goods and reductions in services, which increased the asymmetry in production and price pressures faced by each sector.",
        "One member stated that the revisions to growth expectations by international organizations point to a moderation for advanced and Asian economies, as well as to a marginal increase for Latin American economies.",
        "He/she added that the outlook continues to be subject to a high degree of uncertainty.",
        "He/she pointed out as factors of concern for global growth: i) the persistence of heterogeneity among sectors and economies; ii) the intensification in magnitude and duration of supply shocks; iii) the high demand due to the reopening and to the economic stimuli, and iv) the spread of the Delta variant.",
        "Another member noted that growth forecasts for the United States have been revised downwards for 2021.",
        "All members mentioned that global inflation continued to increase due to pressures from higher commodity and energy prices, as well as production bottlenecks.",
        "Most members added the higher ocean freight costs and some members added spending programs and the marked reallocation of expenditure towards merchandise.",
        "Regarding this last point, one member noted that in the United States, the deflator for durable goods spending increased from -1.54% in February 2020 to that have pressured inflation, the lack of flexibility in production of goods and the unprecedented distortions in the labor market that have led to lower availability of labor, which could be associated with the perception of contagion risk and with the effects of transfers to households.",
        "Another member detailed that OECD estimates suggest that transportation costs from China to the United States and Europe add about 11 percentage points to these economies' merchandise import price inflation, and about 1.5 percentage points to overall inflation.",
        "However, one member added that some stabilization of inflationary dynamics has been observed recently, particularly in advanced economies and in some emerging Asian economies.",
        "Another member noted that the difficulties faced on the production side do not correspond to typical supply shocks.",
        "He/she added that unprecedented stimuli spending has been channeled to the consumption of goods and services available under the pandemic, thus widening output and price differences among sectors.",
        "He/she argued that the lack of flexibility in the production of goods, the reallocation of spending towards merchandise, and an unprecedented fiscal support in advanced economies have reduced supply’s capacity to absorb the growth of demand, generating an environment prone to multiple shocks and inflationary pressures.",
        "In this regard, he/she pointed out that inflationary pressures have been heterogeneous and greater in economies that are more integrated to global trade and that have implemented greater spending stimuli.",
        "He/she mentioned that the disruptions caused by the pandemic are very different from those observed in other crises, contributing to an environment of high uncertainty, which has made it difficult to identify their short- and medium-term effects.",
        "One member considered that inflationary pressures can be foreseen to start subsiding once economic activity normalizes and the production of inputs increases.",
        "He/she pointed out that, in line with the above, the median of forecasts of the members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) anticipates inflation in the United States to be 2.2% at the end of 2022.",
        "He/she stated that the expectation of the transitory nature of inflationary pressures is also reflected in the implied trajectories for the future prices of wheat, corn and soybean, which anticipate deflations in 2022.",
        "Another member noted that several measures of inflation expectations in the United States, including those of business and consumers, have increased.",
        "He/she added that the argued that given the reopening of the economy, the higher inflation outlook and pressures on supply chains and on commodities and energy are not expected to revert soon, and uncertainty about their duration prevails.",
        "Another member said that while the effects of the shocks are expected to be predominantly transitory, the risks to price formation at the global level are on the upside, given the wide range of prices impacted and the magnitude of the price increases, and the extended time horizon over which they have affected inflation.",
        "One member added as upside risks that the potential approval of a new stimulus package in the United States reinforces demand, as well as a worsening of the energy crisis in China due to the shortage of coal and natural gas.",
        "However, he/she added that information from market instruments shows stable inflation expectations for longer terms.",
        "The majority pointed out that the central banks of the main advanced economies have maintained their accommodative monetary stance, although some of them are already expecting to reduce it, while those of several emerging economies continue reducing it.",
        "One member specified that in their latest decisions central banks of advanced economies reaffirmed that the accommodative stances, with interest rates at historically low levels, will be maintained for a prolonged period.",
        "Another member mentioned that the main challenge for central banks has been to distinguish between changes in relative prices that are of a transitory nature and more persistent ones.",
        "He/she considered that in some economies high inflation is being observed along with macroeconomic imbalances, forcing their monetary authorities to act more aggressively.",
        "Most members noted that the Federal Reserve indicated that it could start reducing its asset purchase program this year and that the program would end in mid-2022.",
        "One member mentioned that while this process is expected to be orderly, which would avoid an episode similar to the so-called Taper Tantrum, it is important to have greater caution, as the latest forecasts imply a more rapid adjustment than previously anticipated.",
        "Some members noted that both markets and FOMC members expect the first increase in the federal funds rate to be in 2023.",
        "However, one member added that several FOMC members moved forward their expectations of an increase to 2022.",
        "On the other hand, he/she noted that, in contrast to the global trend of stimulus reduction, and derived from the possible default of China’s real estate developer Evergrande Group, the People's Bank of China took measures to increase liquidity in that economy.",
        "Another member mentioned that despite the increase in inflation, most central banks in emerging economies continue with highly accommodative policy stances and negative real interest rates, which allows them to continue supporting economic activity.",
        "He/she added that Mexico stands out for having a positive ex-ante real interest rate, in contrast to what has been observed in other economies, which are also registering certain deviations of inflation from their targets.",
        "One member highlighted the greater margin for monetary policy maneuver in the United States and other advanced economies.",
        "He/she explained that this is due to structural factors that have lowered inflation, potential growth, and the neutral rate.",
        "He/she added that these economies could be more patient in withdrawing the monetary stimulus, as in recent decades their price formation processes and inflation expectations have remained anchored at or below their target levels.",
        "On the other hand, he/she mentioned that small and open emerging economies are highly sensitive to inflationary pressures and global monetary and financial conditions.",
        "He/she pointed out that Mexico is facing significant external inflationary pressures and, will soon face the effects of greater global financial restrictions.",
        "He/she stated that those economies that complement their domestic savings with external sources must maintain a sound macroeconomic policy stance.",
        "He/she added that monetary policy should contribute to maintain inflation around its target, enabling an orderly adjustment of the economy, the exchange market and the yield curve, while avoiding capital outflows.",
        "Another member pointed out the importance of coordination between fiscal and monetary policies and considered that monetary policy’s effectiveness to achieve the convergence of inflation to the target could be obstructed.",
        "He/she expressed that the processes of fiscal consolidation and normalization of interest rates can trigger different risks that could exert pressure on the dynamics of global inflation and international financial conditions, and thus it is likely that countries facing less fiscal pressure may achieve inflation convergence towards its targets with less effort than those in which the fiscal equilibrium has deteriorated significantly.",
        "Most members stated that international financial markets exhibited a stable performance, and that, recently, interest rates increased, particularly in the United States and the US dollar appreciated in view of prospects of a reduction in the Federal Reserve's asset purchase program.",
        "One member noted that although markets have shown some volatility in recent days, the announcements on the reduction of asset purchases have been carried out without major disruptions in debt markets or in risk premia.",
        "Some members pointed out that in recent weeks some stock indices reached historic highs.",
        "One member stated that this is due to a highly accommodative policy stance at the global level, which implies vulnerabilities in case of a correction in assets' valuation.",
        "Some members noted a mixed performance in emerging economies' financial markets.",
        "One member considered that they were favored by expectations that an accommodative monetary policy stance would be maintained in the United States.",
        "He/she noted that volatility in emerging market currencies decreased sharply, although it increased towards the end of the period.",
        "Another member added that emerging markets exhibited a negative bias due to higher risk aversion.",
        "One member mentioned that moderate capital inflows were observed, although they concentrated mainly in China.",
        "Some members noted that adjustments in monetary conditions could lead to episodes of volatility in international financial markets.",
        "One member noted that this could imply a tightening in financial conditions, especially for emerging economies.",
        "Another member pointed out that the lack of an agreement to increase the debt ceiling in the United States would cause nervousness in financial markets and capital outflows from emerging economies to safe-haven assets.",
        "He/she added as a risk the possible default of _Evergrande Group, since its_ relative importance would imply risks of contagion and systemic risks, which would translate into episodes of volatility at a global level and to a tightening of financing conditions.",
        "Meanwhile, one member considered that the highly accommodative monetary policy would continue to favor global financial conditions for some time.",
        "Most members mentioned that the Mexican economy continued to recover during the third quarter of the year, although stating that there are still marked differences across sectors and regions.",
        "One member added that the Central region, which has a higher concentration of services, was the most affected by the pandemic, while the Northern and North-Central regions, where manufacturing production is more prevalent, performed better.",
        "Some members highlighted that economic activity remains below pre-pandemic levels.",
        "One member stated that the latest data point to a deceleration in economic activity.",
        "He/she specified that, according to the Timely Indicator of Economic Activity (IOAE, for its acronym in Spanish), in August economic activity could have registered a level similar to that of May, indicating four months of stagnation.",
        "On the demand side, most members agreed that consumption continued to recover, although some of them noted that it fell in June.",
        "Some members highlighted that consumption was supported by the good performance of remittances and the wage bill.",
        "One member pointed out that, during the first 7 months of the year, remittances increased by 23.5% as compared to the same period of 2020, and that in July the wage bill exceeded the levels registered in February 2020.",
        "Another member noted that timely indicators of purchases in commercial establishments suggest consumption has performed well.",
        "In turn, some members underlined the weakness of certain indicators related to consumption, such as consumer confidence and sales reported by the National Retailers Association of Mexico (ANTAD, for its Spanish acronym).",

        "However, one member mentioned that in August both oil and nonoil exports fell relative to the previous month.",
        "Another member highlighted that non-oil imports of intermediate goods and consumer goods are above the levels registered in late 2019, while capital imports are at lower levels.",
        "On the supply side, most members underlined the heterogeneous recovery across different sectors.",
        "They underlined that manufacturing is still being affected negatively by the shortage of inputs, especially in sectors more integrated to global production chains, such as the automotive sector.",
        "They added that services continued to recover, albeit heterogeneously across sectors.",
        "One member mentioned that industrial production reactivated in July, due to a boost in manufacturing.",
        "However, he/she warned that the sector overall seems to have lost momentum since the beginning of the second quarter.",
        "Another member stated that the construction sector shows a lack of dynamism and noted that tertiary activities have performed better, although in recent months they have slightly decelerated.",
        "One member added that most components of this sector are still below their prepandemic levels.",

        "He/she highlighted that formal IMSSinsured employment has continued to recover, and is currently at a level 192 thousand jobs lower than that observed in February 2020.",
        "Some members added that the recovery of the labor market is still unequal by gender.",
        "One member underlined that the reading of the labor market has become more complicated.",
        "All members agreed that the economy maintains ample slack conditions, with marked differences across sectors.",
        "One member stated that, according to timely information, slack conditions continued to narrow during the third quarter, although they remain wide and heterogeneous across sectors.",
        "Some members mentioned that these are expected to continue narrowing.",
        "One member emphasized that there is a greater uncertainty in estimates of slack.",
        "He/she added that this derives from the pandemicrelated effects on goods and services’ production capacity, and from a deep reallocation of spending.",
        "Another member expressed that the Global Economic Activity Indicator (IGAE, for its Spanish acronym) has not yet surpassed its pre-pandemic level, and that aggregate activity remains 7.6% below its trend level according to the OECD.",

        "Another member mentioned that market consensus maintains optimistic expectations which confirm a more robust recovery pattern than initially anticipated.",
        "One member mentioned that the third wave of infections, less mobility, stagnation of the IGAE and the decline in business opinion and consumer confidence indicators represent risks for the recovery, which is not yet fully established and is incomplete.",

        "inflationary pressures in the United States.",
        "In this regard, one member underlined that such economy stands out for its high inflationary pressures.",
        "Some members pointed out that the above has affected food merchandise prices.",
        "One member highlighted the importance of these prices in the case of Mexico, given that the food component has a weight of close to 25% in headline inflation, while in other emerging economies it is merely 22%, and in advanced economies it is 14%.",
        "Nevertheless, he/she pointed out that international references suggest that some of these pressures have started to decline.",
        "Another member mentioned the disproportionate impact of food commodity prices on a reduced group of products relevant for the Consumer Price Index.",
        "He/she mentioned that the atypical inflation of just three key products: cooking oils, corn tortilla, and fresh milk, accounts for 50 basis points of the increase in core inflation in 2021.",
        "Nonetheless, he/she added that the international prices of the main production inputs of the latter have already started to decrease.",
        "One member mentioned that non-food merchandise inflation is also highly correlated with that of the United States, which generates a process of imported inflation which would explain the dynamics of higher inflation in the Northern and North-Central regions of Mexico.",
        "Another member pointed out that during 2020, the decline in world inflation levels did not occur in the same magnitude in Mexico.",
        "He/she stated that, despite the stability of the Mexican peso, the prices of goods and services that are susceptible to foreign exchange adjustments have increased constantly, which suggests the high sensitivity of these goods to other global costs in addition to exchange rate pressures.",
        "Most members emphasized the increase in headline and core inflation in the first fortnight of September.",
        "One member indicated that unexpected increments have been observed since the previous monetary policy decision.",
        "He/she added that, this year so far, monthly headline inflation has been above analysts’ expectations and only on two occasions core inflation was lower than anticipated.",
        "rebounded consistently, coming close to 6%, despite economic activity remaining below pre-pandemic levels, the insufficient recovery of employment, and credit to the private sector continuing to contract.",
        "He/she added that the persistence of high inflation levels for a prolonged period can contaminate the price formation process and lead to a de-anchoring of expectations.",
        "One member underlined that headline inflation was affected by additional shocks, causing its trimmed mean indicator to be above 5%.",
        "He/she mentioned that, among emerging economies, Mexico has one of the highest levels of headline and core inflation relative to the headline inflation target, and that, in line with some estimates, recent inflationary dynamics are being pressured by both short-term and higher-persistence factors.",
        "He/she added that the frequency and the magnitude of fortnightly revisions have increased, particularly in merchandise prices.",
        "He/she noted that surveys among private sector businesses point to multiple significant effects on their productive processes, with possible implications on prices.",
        "Finally, he/she mentioned that the financial cost in real terms decreased for all agents and is below the costs expected at the beginning of the year.",
        "Another member considered that inflationary pressures have started to decrease at the margin.",
        "He/she stated that, over the last three fortnights, the monthly changes in headline inflation, services inflation, and non-core inflation have been in line with their historic average.",
        "He/she indicated that the only component with behavior deviating from its historic average is that of merchandise, which has been affected by disruptions in supply chains and by changes in consumption patterns.",
        "However, he/she considered that the magnitude of increments in this component is likely to have decreased.",
        "Most members noted that core inflation has followed an upward trend, mainly due to an increase in the annual change in merchandise inflation has been above 4% for a prolonged period.",
        "Some members noted that the trimmed mean indicator of this component continues to increase.",
        "One member stated that the levels the core sub- index is registering are among the highest observed since April 2009.",
        "All components of this sub-index are under pressure as more than half of their monthly increments lie above 4% at an annualized rate.",
        "Meanwhile the trimmed mean indicator continues showing the same trend than the official figure, which has increased for 10 consecutive months, and already stands nearly at 5%.",
        "One member mentioned that supercore inflation is at 3.43%, which is similar to its pre-pandemic levels.",
        "Another member noted that, over the past five years, merchandise prices have faced constant pressures, which could not be contained during the pandemic despite an unprecedented negative output gap.",
        "One member added that different measures, that adjust this index for seasonality or that are obtained from a decomposition at different frequencies, suggest that the pressures affecting it are greater than those observed in other inflationary episodes.",
        "He/she stated that pressures on non-food merchandise prices show a high degree of dispersion, making it difficult to determine the average duration of these pressures.",
        "Some members mentioned the rise in services inflation in recent months, although other members noted that this component declined at the margin.",
        "One member considered that, notwithstanding the above, the services component continues to be an additional factor of inflationary pressures.",
        "Another member noted that the phenomenon of reversion to trend associated to the gradual reopening of the economy has led to an increase in the annual rate of inflation in the clothing and services components which had displayed price increases below their historical average in 2020.",
        "However, he/she stated that the annualized biennial rate, which eliminates the ups and downs that occurred in the previous two years, shows that the trend in these components is quite stable.",
        "Some members mentioned that non-core inflation reached 8.86% in the first fortnight of September.",
        "One member emphasized that the evolution of this component has reflected two opposite movements: the effect of greater variations in agricultural and livestock product prices and the decline in LP gas inflation from June to date, as a result of the price cap policy.",
        "He/she considered that this contributes to an underestimation of inflation, since during this period the international references of LP gas continued to increase, and thus, in the absence of price caps, headline inflation would probably have been adjusted upwards.",
        "Another member stated that the recent behavior of the non-core sub-index is mainly explained by the increases in LP gas prices, since the price cap policy allows for an adjustment in consumer prices according to international references.",
        "The majority of members pointed out that expectations for headline and core inflation for 2021 and 2022 increased again, while medium- remained more stable, although the latter are at levels above the target.",
        "They highlighted that short-term expectations are well above the target.",
        "One member stated that expectations for the end of 2022 are at a level close to the average observed in other inflationary episodes.",
        "Another member attributed the stability of long-term expectations to the credibility of the central bank.",
        "One member considered the stability of these expectations to be consistent with the transitory nature of current inflationary pressures.",
        "As for inflation expectations derived from market instruments, he/she mentioned that those of 6 to 10 years are currently at 3.0%.",
        "On the other hand, another member added that the compensation for inflation and inflationary risk implicit in 10-year and the year of 70 and 73 basis points, respectively.",
        "He/she considered it of concern that these are on an upward trend and warned that such behavior could mark the beginning of a process of de-anchoring of long-term expectations.",
        "Most members noted that headline and core inflation forecasts were again revised upwards from those published in the April-June 2021 Quarterly Report.",
        "One member stated that this responds to the inflationary pressures that have arisen and to the reduction of slack.",
        "Another member pointed out that headline inflation is expected to converge to the target in the third quarter of 2023.",
        "He/she mentioned that the revised forecasts do not consider additional shocks or the possibility that the current ones may be prolonged.",
        "One member highlighted that the scenarios locate inflation at twice the target level.",
        "He/she estimated that headline inflation will be around 6.4% at the end of the year and that core inflation will be above 5% during the next nine months, reaching a maximum level of 5.6% in February 2022.",
        "The majority of members pointed out that shocks that are expected to be transitory.",
        "However, they noted the risk of a negative impact mentioned that pressures have continued to worsen due to external and domestic factors, and thus their transitory nature seems to be less probable.",
        "He/she warned that the persistence of high inflation levels for a prolonged period could de-anchor medium- and long-term expectations.",
        "He/she said that if inflation remains high for a prolonged period, economic agents incorporate it into their expectations without distinguishing between transitory or permanent increases or between those coming from supply or demand shocks, so that inflationary pressures tend to become entrenched.",
        "Another member mentioned that in addition to supply shocks, inflation is also facing various structural factors that will limit the decline in prices in the coming months.",
        "He/she pointed out that inflationary pressures point to a structural and inertial problem of core inflation that can hardly be considered transitory.",
        "He/she added that the changes in relative prices originated by the new consumption patterns possibly will not be reversed in a long time, given that the upward adjustment in service prices is occurring at the same time that merchandise inflation remains high.",
        "One member mentioned that high inflation is the result of various transitory or exogenous factors: i) the increase in international commodity prices; ii) the reversion of prices to their trend in a group of goods and services, which should not be cause for concern for the central bank since it is the result of the process of closing and gradual reopening of the economy; and iii) the adjustment in the relative prices of some goods derived from changes in consumption patterns and disruptions in production processes.",
        "He/she stated that the change in consumption patterns is a one-time change, and warned that, in the case of disruptions in production processes, it is foreseen that these pressures are to begin receding as the normalization process advances.",
        "He/she added that in the first fortnight of September the joint effect of the atypical variations in merchandise prices and the reversion in services and clothing prices was 109 basis points, which reveals that a significant part of the increase in core inflation is transitory in nature.",
        "He/she considered that inflationary pressures have started to ease at the margin, which will result in a reduction of the annual inflation rate in the future.",
        "Among the upward risks to inflation, most pressures.",
        "Some members added cost pressures and an exchange rate depreciation.",
        "One member mentioned also the risk of high persistence of core inflation and increases in agricultural and livestock product prices.",
        "Another member noted that higher inflationary pressures are expected as the reopening progresses and the output gap closes.",
        "One member noted that, although the deterioration in short-term inflation expectations is marginal, inflation has continued to rise and, although a further increase was already anticipated due to arithmetic effects, this dynamic represents a challenge if inflation expectations continue to be revised upwards.",
        "As for downside risks, another member pointed to the widening of the negative output gap, further social distancing measures, and an exchange rate appreciation.",
        "Most members considered the balance of risks to inflation within the forecast horizon to be biased to the upside.",
        "One member mentioned that this is due to the persistence of multiple supply shocks and the external boost to aggregate demand, and added that inflationary pressures are expected to continue for the next few months.",
        "Most members considered that Mexican financial markets have exhibited a mixed performance since the previous monetary policy decision.",
        "appreciated slightly, although in recent days, and internationally, it depreciated and its volatility increased.",
        "One member noted that the recent depreciation was due to the fact that the peso is one of the most sensitive currencies to interest rate adjustments, which has led to the currency reaching levels above 20.50 pesos per dollar.",
        "He/she added that a favorable adjustment could take place as volatility conditions normalize.",
        "Most members mentioned that interest rates increased.",
        "One member pointed out that the yield curve of government instruments rose, especially in the middle part.",
        "Some members pointed out that the stock market recently registered adjustments in a narrow range.",
        "One member added that the Mexican stock market recorded its highest level of the year during this period.",
        "Another member noted that trading conditions in both the fixed income and equity markets in Mexico had improved.",
        "He/she added that sovereign risk indicators deteriorated slightly.",
        "One member stated that Pemex's risk indicators are still among the highest of all oil companies worldwide.",
        "Regarding monetary aggregates, he/she emphasized the deceleration in their expansion rate, mainly explained by a lower growth of term deposits, since demand for liquid assets remains high, although another member considered that it is still below its level of 2020.",
        "One member pointed out that fiscal discipline in Mexico is an anchor for macroeconomic stability, since there is currently no problem in this area that could exert pressure on sovereign risk or the exchange rate.",
        "Another member added that optimistic growth expectations are strengthened by a balanced fiscal package that, although it does not generate much momentum, it does not distort the decisions of economic agents.",
        "Most members pointed out that credit to the private sector continued to perform poorly and highlighted the fall in financing to firms.",
        "One member stated that this segment has been the most affected, with a reduction of 9.7% in real terms.",
        "Another member mentioned that financing to Small- and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) shows a contraction of 13% compared to pre-pandemic levels, with no signs of improvement.",
        "He/she argued that a contraction of credit is observed even in sectors that did not experience a recession.",
        "Most members noted that consumer credit continued to decline and some members indicated that mortgage lending has grown at a more moderate pace.",
        "One member pointed out that total financing continued to contract in real terms at an annual rate, albeit at a slower pace than in previous months.",
        "He/she added that foreign financing contracted more than domestic financing.",
        "Some members mentioned that delinquency rates have continued to decrease.",
        "One member pointed out that this, together with financial stability conditions, minimizes the possible harmful effect of higher interest rates on households and firms.",
        "He/she added that the decline in credit and investment responds to factors beyond monetary policy, such as economic slack and the environment of uncertainty.",
        "Most Governing Board members pointed out that due to the variety, magnitude, and the extended horizon over which the shocks have affected inflation, they may pose risks to the price formation process and to inflation expectations.",
        "In order to avoid such risks, they deemed necessary to reinforce the monetary policy stance by adjusting it to the trajectory required for inflation to converge to its 3% target within the forecast horizon.",
        "Therefore, they decided to increase the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 25 basis points to 4.75%.",
        "They emphasized that for the next monetary policy decisions they will assess the factors that have an incidence on the foreseen trajectory for inflation and its expectations, in order for the policy rate to be consistent at all times with the inflation to the 3% target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates, enabling an adequate adjustment of the economy and One member considered that given the transitory and exogenous nature of the inflationary process, a less accommodative monetary stance would be inefficient as it does not solve the problems that give rise to the current levels of inflation such as the increase in the prices of commodities and the problems in supply chains.",
        "In contrast, he/she considered that a higher rate would have a negative impact on a wide range of the economy’s margins, such as consumption, investment, credit, public finances and domestic financial markets, among others.",
        "He/she argued that this would occur in the midst of a still incomplete recovery from one of the most severe crises on record.",
        "He/she added that the variables most sensitive to monetary policy, such as credit, consumption and investment, have deteriorated considerably.",
        "He/she pointed out that raising interest rates in the current juncture would also imply not taking advantage of the anchor of fiscal discipline on country risk and on the foreign exchange rate.",
        "He/she highlighted that in the absence of fiscal discipline, the central bank is obliged to provide such an anchor, but that the current fiscal policy should make room for a more accommodative monetary policy.",
        "He/she stated that interest rate increases reduce room for eventually reacting to a cycle of increases in the Federal Reserve’s funds rate and that if Banco de México acts too soon in anticipation, it may be forced to bring the interest rate to levels that are too restrictive in order to avoid a deterioration of its relative stance.",
        "He/she stated that a continued upward adjustment in interest rates may be interpreted as a signal that observed inflation is of a relatively permanent nature.",
        "He/she considered that this may affect inflation expectations and the price formation process.",
        "He/she pointed out that the recent interest rate increases and the subsequent adjustments to shortterm inflation expectations seem to confirm this.",
        "He/she stated that, from the first increase to date, short-term inflation expectations have only increased, so that the intended objective of the supposed reinforcement of monetary policy seems to have had very low effectiveness.",
        "He/she mentioned that it would be better to have a more effective communication policy that thoroughly explains the nature of the inflationary shock, instead of responding mechanically with interest rate increases, which do not manage to slow inflation down and may negatively affect inflation expectations and the price formation process.",
        "He/she expressed that, from his/her view, the idea that interest rate increases are necessary to reinforce the institution’s credibility seems to underestimate the progress achieved in this realm.",
        "Another member highlighted that with the aim of preventing inflation expectations from deteriorating, the recommendation has been to take prudent decisions that are predictable and well communicated.",
        "He/she highlighted that it is important to differentiate between a reinforcement of monetary policy and a cycle of interest rate increases, given that the Mexican economy is in a better macroeconomic position than other similar economies, fiscal and monetary stimuli in Mexico were limited, and an ample slack has been maintained.",
        "He/she stated that reinforcing monetary policy allows to act preventively in light of expectations of less accommodative monetary conditions worldwide in the following months, at a time when inflation has increased again and in which its expectations for the next 12 months and for the end of next year have been marginally affected.",
        "He/she considered that expectations for the next 12 months registered the greater increase and may limit the effectiveness of the monetary policy reinforcement.",
        "He/she added that monetary policy’s effectiveness is also achieved by effectively communicating the factors that are determining the evolution of prices.",
        "He/she pointed out that most of the current inflationary pressures are attributable to an unprecedented situation that will not continue indefinitely, but that these pressures represent a challenge to decision making.",
        "He/she estimated that, considering that the current asymmetric supply shock has favored some sectors and harmed others, a process of reallocation of resources in the economy, which monetary policy should facilitate, is expected.",
        "He/she warned that as a consequence of the pandemic, demand conditions in the loanable funds market have been significantly compressed to levels even below those of the 2008 crisis, which could suggest that the range in which the neutral interest rate is estimated may have adjusted downwards.",
        "One member stated that an increase in the reference rate indicates that the Governing Board is worried about the level and trajectory of inflation and is acting decisively.",
        "He/she mentioned that decisive monetary policy actions are required, taking advantage of the spaces available to meet the central bank’s primary mandate.",
        "He/she noted that recently inflation has been above expectations, leading to their steady deterioration, with levels above 6% for pointed out that this has led to expectations of reference rate increases in the following months, which, in the current scenario, may be justified.",
        "He/she warned that if these increases do not materialize, it could be interpreted as a signal of complacency.",
        "He/she noted that it must be explained that inflationary shocks demand decisive actions and it must be warned that, if inflation continues to increase, the expansionary policy stance will continue to diminish.",
        "He/she stated that in this way credibility will be strengthened in order to maintain inflationary expectations anchored, which allows to comply with the central bank’s primary mandate.",
        "He/she pointed out that expectations of a more robust recovery diminishes the need for a further stimulus.",
        "He/she added that financial conditions and the absolute and relative monetary policy stances allow to continue with an adjustment.",
        "Likewise, global monetary conditions also aim towards a relative monetary policy stance that is less lax.",
        "He/she stated that the improvement in trading conditions in money markets allows to raise interest rates without an undesired tightening of financial conditions.",
        "He/she considered that raising the reference rate will have a reduced effect on economic recovery, given the limited transmission of the credit channel.",
        "He/she mentioned that the causality of monetary policy on inflation via the expectations channel is not bidirectional, since a more restrictive policy stance helps to reduce inflationary pressures rather than the other way around.",
        "Furthermore, the increase in the interest rate sends a signal of greater commitment with the primary objective, while the inaction of monetary policy given the accumulation of inflationary shocks is a factor that generates a deterioration of expectations.",
        "For that reason, he/she pointed out that monetary policy must be proactive in face of the harmful effects of inflationary shocks, regardless of their nature or temporality.",
        "Thus, the increase in rates is a preventive and timely measure in view of transitory shocks that but which, when combined, have an indeterminate duration which may transcend the time-frame in which monetary policy operates.",
        "He/she added that this increase is a direct signal that that more inflation will not be tolerated, in order to avoid a greater deterioration of inflation expectations that would make it harder to maintain an environment of price stability.",
        "Finally, he/she pointed out that if the increase in prices were to continue, the expansionary monetary policy stance will have to be reduced until a neutral posture is achieved, or even one that is slightly restrictive, more consistent with the current inflationary gap and a much narrower negative output gap.",
        "Another member highlighted the rise in inflation once again above expectations, and the subsequent upward adjustment of the expected trajectory in an environment of high uncertainty, pointing out that this situation implies renewed tensions in monetary policy implementation.",
        "He/she added that the increase in inflation has implied a significant loss of purchasing power for the population and that if inflation were to remain elevated for a prolonged period, it would be incorporated into agents’ inflation expectations, which would tend to entrench inflationary pressures in the economy.",
        "He/she considered that any likely initial stage of a process of de-anchoring of long-term expectations necessarily requires timely action by this central bank.",
        "He/she mentioned that if a new adjustment were not implemented, the convergence of inflation to the target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates would be jeopardized.",
        "Additionally, he/she reflected that the appropriate pace for withdrawing the monetary stimulus must be evaluated, arguing that a greater effort should be made in normalizing monetary policy, in order to avoid a scenario of exchange rate depreciation and an acceleration in the pace of price increases.",
        "He/she pointed out that failure to do so would mean failing to comply with the primary mandate.",
        "He/she recalled that, between 2015 and 2017, it took an increase of 400 basis points and 20 months for core inflation to start declining, in the presence of new shocks.",
        "He/she highlighted that an increase in the rate would seek to prevent the further strengthening of second round effects in the price formation process.",
        "He/she stated that, for the time being, no additional risks have materialized but it is very likely that a more complex scenario will be observed, which, under a preventive approach, would require a more aggressive adjustment.",
        "He/she added that, in light of the above, it is essential to maintain a prudent approach in monetary policy that allows to implement adjustments in a timely and sufficient manner, and ensures an orderly and sustainable convergence of inflation to the target.",
        "One member pointed out that headline and core inflation forecasts have been revised significantly upwards on numerous occasions throughout the year, in response to inflationary pressures and to a reduction in ample slack conditions.",
        "He/she added that this points to the need for a trajectory for the interest rate target that reduces the monetary stimulus.",
        "He/she added that, considering the simultaneity and magnitude of the shocks that have affected headline and core inflation, as well as the upward revision of their forecasts and that slack in the economy will close at a faster pace than previously expected, it is essential for Banco de México to reinforce its commitment to comply with its constitutional mandate of safeguarding the domestic currency’s purchasing power.",
        "He/she argued that although shocks to headline and core inflation are expected to be mostly transitory in nature, there is a risk that price formation and inflation expectations may be contaminated due to: i) the broad range of prices affected; ii) the magnitude of price increases; iii) the extended horizon over which they have occurred; iv) the persistent reallocation of household spending; and v) greater uncertainty about the adjustment of the economy and prices in the face of an unprecedented scenario.",
        "He/she considered that tolerating high inflation levels, very much above the target, without reinforcing the monetary policy stance to levels consistent with a trajectory that fosters the convergence of inflation to the target within the forecast horizon, would contribute to deteriorate the price formation process and contaminate inflation expectations, which would in turn undermine Banco de México's credibility, with high costs for society.",
        "Although the shocks that have increased inflation are expected to be transitory, due to their variety, magnitude, and the extended horizon over which they have affected it, they may pose risks to the price formation process and to inflation expectations.",
        "In order to avoid such risks, it was deemed necessary to reinforce the monetary policy stance by adjusting it to the trajectory required for inflation to converge to its 3% target within the forecast horizon.",
        "The Governing Board decided to increase the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 25 basis points to 4.75%.",
        "For the next monetary policy decisions, the Governing Board will assess the factors that have an incidence on the foreseen trajectory for inflation and its expectations, in order for the policy rate to be consistent at all times with the orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to the 3% target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates, enabling an adequate adjustment of the economy and financial markets.",
        "Alejandro Díaz de León, Galia Borja, Irene Espinosa, and Jonathan Heath voted in favor of increasing the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 25 basis points to 4.75%.",
        "Gerardo Esquivel voted in favor of leaving the target for the overnight interbank interest rate unchanged at 4.50%.",
        "I believe that raising the interest rate in the current juncture is ineffective and inefficient.",
        "It is ineffective because a higher rate does not solve the factors that originate inflationary pressures: increases in international input prices and disruptions in supply chains.",
        "It is inefficient because the increase may affect the economy in several areas: consumption, investment, credit and public finances.",
        "The increase also reduces future room for the time when the Federal Reserve begins its normalization process.",
        "Acting too soon in anticipation of said process may imply that in the future the rate will have to be adjusted to a very restrictive level to avoid affecting the relative policy stance.",
        "Finally, the increase could also be counterproductive.",
        "Continued increases could be interpreted as signals that inflation is of a permanent nature.",
        "This could affect expectations and the price formation process.",
        "Since the first increase to date, short-term expectations have only risen and therefore the sought objective has not been met.",
        "Thus, the question arises as to whether a communication policy that explains the nature of the current inflationary shock clearly would be better than responding mechanically with continuous rate increases.",
        "All members agreed that global economic activity continued to recover heterogeneously across countries and sectors.",
        "Some members attributed the recovery to the loosening of lockdown measures, the vaccination process, and to the fiscal and monetary stimuli.",
        "One member added that those economies with the most support, mainly the advanced ones, will reach pre-pandemic activity levels in a shorter time period.",
        "Most members highlighted the improvement in mentioned the upward revision of OECD forecasts for 2021 and 2022, to 5.6 and 4.0%, respectively.",
        "In the case of the U.S., some members underlined that the OECD forecast for 2021 was revised from 3.2 to economies of the euro area, the United Kingdom and Japan have observed a relatively weaker recovery.",
        "Most members considered that expectations of a associated with the approval of the significant fiscal stimulus and with progress in the vaccination process.",
        "One member stated that the output gap in that economy is foreseen to be positive before the year ends and that it will remain positive during the next two years.",
        "Another member considered that the fiscal package approval has significantly affected the global economic outlook.",
        "Some members pointed out, as risks to the world economy, the evolution of the pandemic and possible delays in the vaccination programs.",
        "Most members noted that commodity prices rose.",
        "They highlighted that oil prices exhibited significant increases and volatility.",
        "One member added that increases in those prices have moderated in view of the OPEC’s decision to maintain its supply of crude oil.",
        "Most members pointed out that global inflation rose mainly due to the increase in energy prices, inflation remains at levels below their central bank targets.",
        "One member added that this also reflected the impact of temporary factors and the end of subsidies and tax cuts that had been implemented in some countries in response to the pandemic.",
        "Some members mentioned that in most emerging economies inflation has risen recently.",
        "One member considered that the exchange rate depreciation contributed to the above.",
        "Another member pointed out that in some of these economies inflation remains close to or even below the targets of their respective central banks.",
        "Most members stated that global inflation particularly in the U.S., in light of a greater fiscal stimulus and an outlook for a more vigorous recovery.",
        "Some members noted that compensation for inflation and inflation risk in the medium term has increased.",
        "One member stated that, in the U.S., inflation risk premia rose by 50 basis points this year so far and that five-year, five-year forward inflation expectations reached 2.4%.",
        "Another member pointed out that fixed-income assets have begun to incorporate the higher inflation expectations.",
        "Some members added that the fiscal stimulus is foreseen to enable higher growth without exerting significant pressure on prices.",
        "One member considered that this assumes a small slope in the Phillips curve.",
        "Another member recalled that inflation in said country has been persistently low in recent years, and that thus it is still to be seen if, on this occasion, the economic recovery will have a sustained effect on prices.",
        "Most members mentioned that the central banks of advanced economies reiterated their intention to maintain accommodative monetary policy stances.",
        "They underlined that the Federal accommodative policy stance for an extended period and that said central bank considers inflationary pressures in 2021 to be transitory, and that for this reason, an increase in the federal funds rate will not be necessary until 2023.",
        "One member emphasized that such central bank maintained the range for its reference rate and its asset purchase program for USD 120 billion, although inflation pressures seem to be demandrelated.",
        "In this regard, another member indicated that a first element of uncertainty over the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy stance refers precisely to the asset purchase program, which was designed for an environment of weak demand, and that it is currently in a juncture of increased public debt issuances and high uncertainty in the mid- and longend of the yield curve.",
        "He/she noted that an eventual announcement of a downward adjustment in asset purchases could have a significant impact on markets.",
        "One member added that a greater tightening in financial conditions, stemming from a possible reversal of the monetary stimulus, in a context of historic levels of both public and private debt, could pose a risk to global financial stability.",
        "Another member pointed out that the interest rate trajectory implied by market instruments indicates that the reference rate will start to increase in 2022, which differs from the Federal Reserve’s forecast.",
        "He/she added that this discrepancy, as well as the volatility observed in global markets, could be due to a lack of understanding or confidence in the implementation of the new monetary policy framework.",
        "In this regard, he/she noted the highly accommodative nature of monetary policy as a result of the change in long-term targets announced by the Federal Reserve last August.",
        "He/she mentioned that, on the one side, the maximum employment goal is more ambitious than before since it is now defined as broad-based and inclusive.",
        "He/she pointed out that said central bank has acknowledged that the benefits of the economic recovery reach the most disadvantaged only after several years of sustained growth.",
        "He/she stated that, on the other hand, the price stability goal is more lax than before given that after inflation has remained below 2% for a certain period, now it will be allowed to be slightly above 2% for a certain time.",
        "He/she concluded that the latter implies that monetary policy must remain accommodative for a longer period than what the past framework implied.",
        "He/she underlined that it would be foreseeable that the discrepancy in the trajectory of interest rates fades away insofar as the Federal Reserve communicates its signals clearly and consistently.",
        "Most members observed that some emerging economies’ central banks have begun to implement a less accomodative monetary policy and have even increased their reference rates.",
        "One member said that, in some cases, these actions were unexpected, and took place in a context of inflationary pressures.",
        "Another member pointed out that most central banks of these economies maintain highly accommodative monetary policy stances.",
        "He/she stressed that although it is true that some central banks of these countries have recently raised their reference rates, the idiosyncratic character of these decisions needs to be highlighted, and therefore no simplistic extrapolations of these episodes should be made.",
        "All members highlighted the large fiscal stimulus recently approved in the United States.",
        "Most of them observed that such stimulus equals approximately three times the US output gap in 2020.",
        "One member pointed out that it represents over 9% of 2020 GDP and it adds to the already expected deficit for 2021 of around 10.35% of GDP.",
        "He/she noted that a package of additional spending in infrastructure is currently being evaluated in the United States.",
        "He/she noted that it is not clear how much of the large transfers that will increase households’ disposable income will be spent, and in which time-frame.",
        "He/she highlighted that in some advanced economies transfers of this type have been saved in greater magnitude than initially foreseen, which increases the uncertainty concerning the temporality of fiscal spending’s impact on aggregate demand and its effect on inflation.",
        "Another member mentioned that while some specialists argue that this program would cause an economic overheating and a de-anchoring of inflation expectations, others consider that it would not generate a persistent increase in inflation above its target nor an early tightening in financial conditions.",
        "He/she stated that in any case the approval of the stimulus has had a significant effect on the world economic outlook and on international financial markets.",
        "One member stated that, for emerging economies, this environment implies higher levels of external demand and therefore higher growth –driven by the boost generated by a more vigorous growth in the U.S. – but also tighter financial conditions.",
        "All members agreed that global financial markets exhibited volatility and that medium- and long- term interest rates increased in the United States, in view of the approval of a large fiscal stimulus and prospects of higher growth.",
        "Most members pointed that an adjustment in portfolios has been observed.",
        "Some members stated that, in general, tighter global financial conditions have been observed, with increases in all terms of the yield curves.",
        "One member added that volatility in financial markets is also due to various factors, such as: i) the pandemic-related shock, whose origin is not associated to the economic or financial cycle; ii) the outlook of a heterogeneous global recovery across countries, with significant differences in their yield curves and with possible exchange rate adjustments and adjustments in the external accounts; and iii) the modification of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy strategy, which implies that there is no available information to anticipate or extrapolate the Federal Reserve’s possible actions or the implementation of its new strategy.",
        "Most members mentioned that the US dollar appreciated and that stock markets in advanced economies registered moderate gains.",
        "Some members pointed out the positive effect of higher growth prospects.",
        "One member mentioned that the technology sector was the exception because of a possible overvaluation of its assets.",
        "Another member stated that risk asset prices have increased in general due to excess liquidity, which implies a latent risk of adjustments in their prices.",
        "Some members noted a less favorable environment for financial markets in emerging economies, which incorporates the expectation of tighter global financial conditions.",
        "Most members stated that particularly to fixed-income assets.",
        "One member mentioned that inflows to equity assets continue, mainly towards the Asian region.",
        "Most members highlighted the recomposition of capital flows towards the Chinese economy, due to the incorporation of their debt instruments in global bond indices.",
        "Some members pointed out that, given the interest rate levels in China and the low exchange rate risk in its instruments, the remaining emerging economies face greater challenges to attract capital flows.",
        "One member added that the increase in medium- and long-term interest rates in the United States also implies greater difficulties to attract and retain capital, exchange rate adjustments, and upward pressures on yield curves.",
        "He/she also mentioned in addition to such challenges the idiosyncratic effects of the pandemic on the macroeconomic soundness and the recovery outlook of emerging economies.",
        "Another member pointed out that a slight increase in the country risk indicators of these economies was also observed.",
        "Some members identified possible inflation surprises as a risk for financial markets.",
        "In this regard, one member highlighted the case of the United States.",
        "Another member referred to the possibility of the monetary stimulus reverting in different economies and expects the environment of uncertainty to prevail until the effects of the fiscal stimulus on inflation and on interest rates are clearer.",
        "One member pointed out that global financial markets will continue to benefit from the economic recovery prospects.",
        "He/she added that the possibility of a reversion in long-term interest rates should not be discarded, in case market expectations start to align with the Federal Reserves’ messages, although there could be additional episodes of volatility as long as some degree of uncertainty or mistrust regarding the future trajectory of interest rates persists.",
        "All members highlighted that domestic economic activity decelerated in January and February.",
        "Most members stated that the deceleration was due to the intensification of the pandemic, the implementation of new mobility restrictions, as well as supply disruptions of certain inputs.",
        "They underlined that some timely indicators point to a contraction during the first quarter of 2021.",
        "One member stated that the Timely Indicator of Economic Activity suggests an annual variation of-4% in the Global Indicator of Economic Activity (IGAE, for its Spanish acronym) in February.",
        "Another member mentioned that the economic recovery is still in a critical situation.",
        "Regarding demand, most members agreed that the recovery has been driven mostly by the external sector.",
        "One member highlighted that in January manufacturing exports surpassed their prepandemic levels.",
        "In this regard, he/she stressed that external demand is expected to continue contributing significantly to the economic recovery in Mexico.",
        "He/she considered this to be the case, given the upward revisions to US industrial production forecasts for 2021.",
        "He/she added that the recovery of exports and the weakness of imports have contributed to a large trade surplus.",
        "Nevertheless, most members noted that exports decelerated in January.",
        "Some members underlined that the fall in Mexican exports was mainly due to a global shortage of key inputs.",
        "Most members mentioned that investment and consumption remain lackluster.",
        "One member pointed out that in the last months both components have decelerated in response to the additional distancing measures implemented, and highlighted that investment has been significantly affected.",
        "Some members added that investment and its components remain below pre-pandemic levels, one member noted that both domestic machinery and equipment, and construction remain the most affected sectors.",
        "Some members added that capital imports, construction and sales of heavy vehicles remain weak.",
        "As for consumption, one member underlined that total sales reported by the National Association of Self-Service and Department Stores sales of light vehicles and weekly spending via credit and debit cards increased moderately, and are still at levels below those recorded prior to the pandemic.",
        "Another member considered that job losses and the deterioration of consumer confidence suggest that consumption will continue to recover at a slow pace, despite the dynamism of remittances.",
        "One member highlighted that remittances continue supporting both consumption of over 1.7 million households and the economic recovery.",
        "Regarding supply, all members underlined the loss of dynamism in production at the beginning of the year.",
        "They pointed out that this was mostly due to the mobility restrictions implemented in some states and to the temporary interruption in the supply of some industrial inputs.",
        "Most members highlighted that the manufacturing sector, particularly the automotive industry, was affected by the shortage of semiconductors.",
        "One member recalled the disruptions to the supply of natural gas and of electric power in Mexico, which derived from climatic events in the south of the U.S. in mid-February.",
        "Most members pointed out that a gradual and heterogeneous recovery across sectors and regions is expected.",
        "One member underlined that the recovery has been differentiated and that the economic subsectors, which continue registering a contraction of over 5% in their monthly activity as compared to their pre-pandemic levels, account for around 26% of GDP.",
        "He/she added that, within the industry, manufacturing has led the recovery, while construction registers activity levels that are over He/she added that services have exhibited an even more differentiated behavior, in which those provided in person continue to be significantly affected.",
        "Most members noted that the recovery of the labor market has lost strength and that some indicators have deteriorated at the margin.",
        "One member mentioned that the national labor participation rate stagnated in January due to a lower urban participation rate.",
        "Another member pointed out that, although up to February of this year 9.7 out of the 12.5 million jobs lost between February and April 2020 were regained, said recovery has lost dynamism.",
        "He/she added that in February IMSSinsured jobs were 3.28% below the figure registered during the same month of 2020.",
        "One member mentioned that estimates of urban unemployment were above 6.5% in January, and that the broadest unemployment measure, which includes the unemployed population, the underemployed population and the population available to work, increased by 900 thousand people between December and January.",
        "Some members expressed their concern about the deterioration of the labor market being greater for women, which has widened the gender gap.",
        "One member indicated that differences between age groups have also increased.",
        "Most members highlighted the increase in growth expectations for the Mexican economy in 2021.",
        "They mentioned that this is mainly due to a greater boost from external demand and to prospects of progress in the vaccination process.",
        "One member added the better-thanexpected performance of economic activity during the second half of 2020 and higher levels of activity associated with the expenditure for the electoral process of June 2021.",
        "Another member emphasized that, starting from February 15, Mexico began the national vaccination campaign among the senior citizens.",
        "Some members pointed out that, as mobility restrictions ease and greater progress is attained in the vaccination process, the pace of recovery is expected to accelerate in the second half of the year.",
        "The majority of members highlighted that in the last weeks various sources have revised growth expectations for 2021 upwards.",
        "One member considered it feasible for the economy to grow over underlined that said growth will not be sustainable or lasting in the absence of a significant recovery of productive investment in the medium and long terms.",
        "The majority of members pointed out that productive activity continues to operate under ample slack conditions.",
        "One member stated that these slack conditions are shown by diferent indicators, which reflect a considerable underutilization of available resources in the economy.",
        "He/she mentioned that the output gap remained close to 7% and that the labor underemployment rate lied at 15%, close to twice the figure observed in normal times.",
        "Another member mentioned that available information suggests that slack conditions will remain significantly wide during the first quarter of 2021.",
        "Most members stated that throughout the forecast horizon.",
        "One member mentioned that the amount of slack might decrease as the economic recovery becomes more vigorous.",
        "Another member added that slack conditions will be very different across sectors.",
        "Some members highlighted that the balance of risks for economic activity is biased to the downside.",
        "One member underlined that, although this bias has diminished due to an improved economic outlook, challenges stemming from the weakness of demand and the labor market, as well as from the evolution of the pandemic, persist.",
        "Another member highlighted that despite the improvement in the expected recovery, the following risks stand out: i) an upsurge in COVID-19 cases or delays in the vaccination program; ii) negative effects of input shortages on production; iii) volatility in financial markets; iv) deterioration of credit portfolio quality; v) lower public revenues, impacts on sovereign risk and on the conditions of access to financial markets; and vi) uncertainty affecting investment.",
        "All members mentioned the increase in annual headline inflation.",
        "Some members noted that this increase was higher than expected.",
        "One member pointed out that it was above the market consensus and even above the highest expectations drawn from the latest survey.",
        "He/she explained that the prices of goods and services which are more sensitive to pressures generated by energy prices and the exchange rate, are the ones increasing the most.",
        "Another member pointed out that the pandemic has implied changes in relative prices, with upward pressures on merchandise inflation and downward pressures on services inflation.",
        "He/she added that in addition there are pressures on the prices of certain raw materials, mainly those that are energy-related.",
        "He/she stated that all of the above reflects the shocks to which inflation has been subject.",
        "One member noted that although the level of inflation during the first fortnight of March was above the interval established by Banco de México, this should not be interpreted as a generalized increase in prices.",
        "He/she detailed that the proportion of goods and services with significant monthly variations below their historical averages is close to 50% and that the percentage is higher if the components of core inflation are the only ones considered.",
        "He/she stated that this has not translated into lower inflation because the intensive component of increases in certain prices has prevailed over the extensive component of decline in inflation of most prices.",
        "Most members pointed out that core inflation increased during the first fortnight of March, with some members highlighting the upward trend of the non-food merchandise component.",

        "Some members noted that the projected short-term trajectories for inflation are slightly higher than those published in the Quarterly Report October-December 2020.",
        "Some members mentioned that higher increases in energy prices are expected due to the reactivation of the world economy.",

        "One member pointed out that such bias is observed in the short term.",
        "Another member added that this occurs despite the amount of slack in the economy, since it is foreseeable that core inflation pressures will continue due to the recomposition of spending derived from the pandemic, and that the low levels of services inflation stops offsetting the high levels of merchandise inflation as activities begin to reopen.",
        "He/she also mentioned that more episodes of foreign exchange depreciation can be expected due to external and domestic factors and to a higher level of inflation worldwide.",
        "One member considered that the balance has deteriorated at the margin.",
        "Another member highlighted that none of the inflation determinants have deteriorated significantly to the point of expecting upward pressures on prices given that: i) ample slack conditions persist; ii) the peso exchange rate has withstood episodes of volatility and has depreciated only moderately; and iii) despite the increases in international oil prices, their impact on domestic prices is expected to be partially mitigated by the federal government's pricing policy.",

        "They pointed out the importance of inflation converging to its target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates.",
        "Most members mentioned that this pause in the easing cycle does not mean that said cycle has ended, and that looking ahead they will be aware in case the conditions allow for continuing it.",
        "They stated that although monetary policy might contribute to the recovery, it must do so without jeopardizing price stability.",
        "Furthermore, all members highlighted that monetary policy implementation faces risks associated, mainly, with the recent evolution of financial markets, and mentioned the importance of applying a prudent and cautious approach.",
        "Finally, they pointed out that, looking ahead, monetary policy implementation will depend on the evolution of the factors that have an trajectories within the forecast horizon, and on One member stated that emerging economies continue to be affected by pandemic-related shocks and that now they are also facing the effects of the US fiscal stimulus.",
        "He/she noted that said stimulus will increase the demand for exports, thereby supporting the recovery, but will also exert pressure on global interest rates and increase the risks of abrupt adjustments in financial markets.",
        "He/she pointed out that in small and open emerging economies, which need to complement their domestic savings with external financing sources, it is even more important to maintain a stable macroeconomic environment that attracts capital and fosters an orderly adjustment in the economy.",
        "In this regard, he/she considered that monetary policy should contribute to maintain inflation low and around its target, containing increases in risk premia and medium- and long-term interest rates, as well as exchange rate adjustments.",
        "He/she noted that the pandemic has implied a significant economic contraction and major changes in relative prices.",
        "This, in a context of an exchange rate depreciation, pressures on fiscal revenues, challenges regarding the sovereign credit rating, and recent increases in external interest rates.",
        "He/she pointed out that in addition to the above, the prices of some commodities, mainly energy-related, have increased.",
        "He/she mentioned that in view of the challenges described above, monetary policy must foster an orderly adjustment of relative prices and prevent an impact on price formation and inflation expectations, in order to maintain low inflation on a sustained basis.",
        "He/she added that the risks to which domestic financial markets and inflation are subject to have increased.",
        "He/she highlighted that the latest information shows a greater persistence of inflationary pressures on core inflation.",
        "Although it is foreseen that such pressures will be transitory, it is necessary to maintain a prudent monetary policy stance that leads to a decreasing trajectory for headline and core inflation towards the 3% target.",
        "Another member pointed out that headline inflation is expected to rebound during the second quarter of the year, due to two factors that will generate an increase in the non-core component.",
        "He/she pointed out that one factor is the arithmetic effect related to a low annual comparison base and the other has to do with the increases in energy prices that are already taking place due to the reactivation of the world.",
        "He/she stated that, in principle, both factors are generated by supply shocks that are transitory and that give rise to changes in relative prices or to firstround adjustments in inflation.",
        "On the other hand, he/she mentioned that since the last meeting, greater volatility in financial markets and a reversion of capital flows have been observed.",
        "He/she considered it prudent to make a pause in the monetary easing cycle and pointed out that this should not be considered as the end of such cycle, but rather a pause that will allow to validate expectations of a downward trajectory of the core component.",
        "He/she highlighted the need to evaluate the presence of second-round effects that affect inflation expectations, the effects of the fiscal stimulus in the United States, the conditions in which international financial markets operate, and the slack conditions.",
        "He/she underlined that on previous occasions the conditions were appropriate to act concurrently with the easing cycle, but that now it was necessary to monitor the available information carefully to evaluate whether there is another opportunity to support the economic recovery without jeopardizing price stability and without compromising the anchoring of medium- and long-term inflation expectations.",
        "One member underlined that in the case of Mexico there is statistically significant evidence that the rise in long-term interest rates in the United States increases sovereign risk indicators, which in turn affects the exchange rate.",
        "He/she stated that the recent evolution of international financial markets suggests acting prudently, and therefore the monetary policy decision should consider the probability of a more depreciated exchange rate, in order to anticipate more objectively the trajectory of inflation’s convergence to the target within the forecast horizon.",
        "He/she added that said decision should take into account the beginning of the normalization of reference rates in emerging economies and the fact that despite the amount of slack, the balance of risks for inflation is biased to the upside.",
        "He/she added that the tightening in financial conditions and a low margin of fiscal support reduce the room for maneuver for monetary policy.",
        "Given the complex environment, he/she considered it essential that monetary policy is conducted prudently and cautiously, in order to promote an orderly adjustment of financial markets and the sustained convergence of inflation to the 3% target.",
        "Another member stated that, since the last decision, the window of opportunity for further monetary easing has closed.",
        "This, as a result of serious doubts about the forecasted trajectory of inflation’s convergence to the target, especially in the short term; the possibility of further external financial shocks; the stability of the financial system; the evolution of the pandemic and the vaccination campaign; and the limits faced by a low reference rate.",
        "He/she acknowledged that, while it has been confirmed that the economic recovery remains fragile and needs as much monetary support as possible, there are considerations that imply a pause in monetary easing.",
        "He/she pointed out an increase in inflation, a steepening of the yield curve, a greater depreciation of the Mexican peso, an increase in risk aversion, certain impacts on macrofinancial stability, and the possibility of more external shocks of a financial nature.",
        "He/she noted that this scenario is largely the result of the approval of the fiscal package in the United States.",
        "He/she highlighted that in order to be able to maintain low rates to support the economic recovery, the existing room for maneuver should be managed with caution, as we are near the lower limit of the reference rate.",
        "Thus, the accommodative cycle should resume only when the circumstances allow for it and better opportunities are present again.",
        "He/she pointed out that the highly volatile external circumstances have reduced the room for maneuver of the relative monetary policy stance.",
        "On the other hand, the space offered by the absolute policy stance can be reduced due to higher inflation rates and to an increase in the short-term neutral rate.",
        "He/she warned that Banco de México’s sphere of action is limited by domestic and external economic-financial aspects that evolve rapidly and in directions difficult to detect.",
        "In particular, economic policy faces many unknowns that will have to be resolved.",
        "He/she stated that the dilemma for monetary policy is that the economy is in recession with a temporary increase in inflation and a core component that is not decreasing.",
        "Consequently, he/she considered that given the extraordinary conditions of the pandemic and the lag with which monetary policy operates, it is time to cautiously assess monetary policy’s room for maneuver in order to avoid in the future a position of vulnerability that may affect the credibility of the Central Bank, as well as the anchoring of inflationary expectations.",
        "He/she emphasized that monetary support should continue, especially in the absence of fiscal support, which implies that monetary policy continues being the only available tool, even when this is not ideal.",
        "He/she therefore stated the need for a monetary support such as domestic and external financial conditions allow.",
        "He/she pointed out that this pause does not mean that monetary easing has ended, but that windows of opportunity should be carefully determined to continue supporting the economic recovery while reinforcing Banco de México's commitment to monetary stability.",
        "One member mentioned that a pause will allow for strengthening the message of the Central Institute's commitment to price stability at a time of various concerns due to both domestic and external factors.",
        "Looking ahead, he/she considered that there is still room for additional interest rate cuts, which, if they materialize, could contribute to the recovery of the Mexican economy without jeopardizing the price stability objective.",
        "He/she pointed out that Mexico, unlike other countries, has maintained solid macroeconomic fundamentals that could allow implementing an accommodative policy stance for a prolonged time, without the need to anticipate the adjustments the Federal Reserve will eventually make.",
        "He/she mentioned that fiscal discipline has contributed to reduce domestic absorption and, therefore, to improve the current account, which in turn contributes to reduce pressures on the exchange rate.",
        "He/she also stated that fiscal discipline relieves pressure on the sovereign risk premium and prevents capital outflows related to concerns about default.",
        "He/she highlighted that the origin of the recent episode of volatility in global markets is the prospect of a rapid economic recovery of our most important trading partner, so that the current situation does not essentially imply a negative shock.",
        "He/she mentioned that, from his/her point of view, most of the volatility stems from the inadequate perception of the role that central banks will play in the recovery process, which he/she considered will be resolved if the Federal Reserve remains clear and consistent in its policy messages and actions, as it has been doing so far.",
        "He/she considered that additional interest rate cuts would be beneficial for several reasons: i) the economy will continue to operate with an ample amount of slack for an extended period; ii) an unfavorable performance is observed in those areas where monetary policy has a direct impact, such as credit to households and firms, consumption and investment; iii) the current account surplus reflects that the monetary policy stance is still restrictive for the current economic conditions; and iv) Mexico's real interest rate continues to be above that observed in most emerging economies.",
        "He/she expressed that there could be a window of opportunity to continue with the monetary easing process as long as the rest of the macroeconomic policies continue being a factor of stability and price anchoring, and once the current uncertainty in financial markets is resolved.",
        "In a highly uncertain environment, the risks for inflation, economic activity and financial markets pose major challenges for monetary policy.",
        "It is necessary to enable an orderly adjustment of financial conditions and a change in relative prices, without affecting price formation and inflation expectations.",
        "Considering the abovementioned inflation forecasts, the risks they are subject to, as well as the need to consolidate a downward trajectory for headline and core inflation to the 3% target, with the presence of all its members, the Governing Board decided unanimously to maintain the target for the overnight interbank interest rate at implementation will depend on the evolution of the factors that have an incidence on inflation, on its foreseen trajectories within the forecast horizon, and on its expectations.",
        "The Governing Board will take the necessary actions based on incoming information in order for the policy rate to be consistent with the orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to the 3% target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates.",
        "It is necessary to safeguard the institutional framework, strengthen the macroeconomic fundamentals and adopt the necessary actions on both monetary and fiscal policy fronts, to enable a better adjustment of domestic financial markets and of the economy as a whole.",
        "Alejandro Díaz de León-Carrillo, Galia Borja-Gómez, Irene Espinosa-Cantellano, Gerardo Esquivel Hernández and Jonathan Ernest Heath-Constable voted in favor of maintaining the target for the overnight interbank interest rate at 4.00%.",
        "The majority pointed out that global economic activity continues to strengthen, mainly because of vaccine availability and stimulus spending.",
        "They added that the economic recovery has been heterogeneous across countries, highlighting that China and the United States continue leading the global recovery.",
        "One member highlighted the improvement in Europe due to the process of reopening in several countries, while in Japan weak conditions prevail due to new confinement measures.",
        "He/she noted that emerging economies show a greater heterogeneity because of the upsurge of infections in some regions and a reduced room to provide additional stimuli.",
        "He/she added that ample slack conditions prevail in most economies.",
        "In this regard, some members stated that the recovery is still incomplete.",
        "One member considered that a complete recovery is still far from being attained and highlighted that several productive sectors, and especially employment, still remain below prepandemic levels.",
        "Another member pointed out that unemployment in middle- and low-income countries continues to be much higher than it was before the pandemic, with significant differences across sectors and by gender, with older women being the most affected.",
        "He/she mentioned that emerging economies continue facing obstacles to achieve a significant and sustained recovery.",
        "The majority noted the upward adjustment in global growth forecasts, which is expected to continue to be supported mainly by the recovery in the United States and China.",
        "One member mentioned that the world economy is expected to grow faster in 2021 than in the last 48 years.",
        "Another member pointed out that the current recovery is foreseen to be the fastest since World War II.",
        "As for risks, some members mentioned those associated with the pandemic.",
        "One member added the risk of continued disruptions in production chains, which is anticipated until there is a complete normalization of activities around the world.",
        "The majority mentioned that global inflation continued increasing as a result of pressures on various commodity prices, base effects, and bottlenecks in production.",
        "Some members added labor market pressures and higher transportation costs.",
        "The majority pointed out that in some economies inflation is above the targets of their respective central banks.",
        "They noted that in the United States, the annual Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation reached 5% in May, the highest expectations are at high levels worldwide.",
        "One member highlighted that while market expectations in advanced economies have recently declined, they remain at higher levels than those recorded in 2019.",
        "Another member stated that in the United States, 2- year inflation expectations have been above 3% over the last weeks.",
        "Some members pointed out that inflation pressures are expected to be transitory.",
        "One member said that this perception is shared among international organizations, central banks and analysts, and that it is reflected in the implied trajectory according to various market instruments.",
        "He/she argued that this derives from the fact that the base effects are expected to fade, that the observed increases in international commodity prices are expected to stabilize and even revert, and that the pressures that are currently present in certain markets are expected to ease, in view of an eventual response from supply.",
        "The majority highlighted the risk of supply chain disruptions being longer-lasting than anticipated and inflationary pressures being more persistent than anticipated.",
        "One member stated that, although these disruptions are considered to be transitory, a permanent destruction of the production capacity of certain links in global chains cannot be ruled out.",
        "He/she noted that, in such scenario, the shortage of inputs would have more serious and lasting consequences, exerting significant pressures on inflation.",
        "He/she added that, if the Federal Reserve normalizes its monetary policy more rapidly, this would exacerbate volatility in financial markets and accentuate inflationary pressures, especially in emerging economies.",
        "Some members added the presence of inflationary pressures stemming from the recovery of demand in the face of large fiscal stimuli, especially in the United States.",
        "One member considered that the balance of risks for global inflation has started to deteriorate.",
        "Another member emphasized that the effects associated with the pandemic are unprecedented and that their impact on economic activity and inflation is very uncertain.",
        "He/she added that the rate of infections and vaccine availability have been significant determinants of consumer confidence and labor markets.",
        "He/she pointed out that the disruptions caused by the pandemic are very different from those observed in other crises, and therefore it has been more complex to identify their short- and medium-term effects.",
        "In this regard, he/she mentioned that economic activity and inflation forecasts have not fully captured the challenges of the current situation.",
        "One member stated that the risk of a higher-than-expected inflation seems to have started to mitigate given the recent adjustments in commodity prices, food prices in particular.",
        "He/she mentioned that other sources of concern regarding the risk of higher inflation, such as disruptions in supply chains, higher freight costs, and labor market pressures are associated with unusual operating conditions caused by the pandemic.",
        "He/she sustained that it can be foreseen that as the normalization of activities continues, the operating conditions will also improve and wage pressures will begin to fade as a result of increases in labor supply.",
        "The majority highlighted that the central banks of stimulus unchanged.",
        "One considered that less monetary stimuli are expected in the medium term.",
        "The majority pointed out that in the Federal forecasts for inflation and economic growth increased, as well as the expectations for the federal funds rate.",
        "One member noted that the president of that central bank emphasized that some of the communication tools used, such as the socalled dot-plot, did not represent a decision or a plan of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).",
        "Most members added that such institution has begun to analyze an eventual reduction in its asset purchases.",

        "Some members emphasized that the Federal Reserve will maintain its current policy stance until the economy has made substantial further progress towards meeting its objectives.",
        "One member mentioned that it is important to remember that the Federal Reserve policy stance remains highly accommodative.",
        "He/she recalled that, although the members of its committee acknowledged an increase in inflation, they attributed said increase to transitory factors and reiterated that risks to economic recovery persist.",
        "He/she sustained that, even after incorporating the recent changes in the members’ projections, the interest rate would remain at very low levels, at least, until the end of policy framework, he/she considered that it has allowed it to achieve historically low levels of real interest rates.",
        "He/she stated that this implies that it has successfully dealt with the problems associated with the lower limit of the reference rate, without affecting long-term inflation expectations and achieving a greater stimulus.",
        "As to the possibility of an anticipated tightening of monetary conditions, he/she considered it improbable that the Federal Reserve would act hastily, as it would affect the economic recovery.",
        "He/she mentioned that said entity has been very consistent in its narrative and highly coherent in its actions, and therefore it is unlikely that the withdrawal of monetary stimulus will occur before there are clear signs of a large and inclusive economic recovery.",

        "He/she added that in most of these economies real interest rates remain in negative terrain, even in those that are currently undergoing significant deviations of inflation from their target.",
        "He/she highlighted that this is partly due to the fact that inflationary pressures are considered to be transitory and that the increase in international commodity prices is a dominant factor on inflation in these economies, and therefore monetary policy cannot do much to counteract such pressures.",
        "All members noted that after the Federal international financial markets exhibited some volatility.",
        "However, the majority considered that, in general, these markets have performed favorably.",

        "Some members highlighted the flattening of the US yield curve.",
        "One member mentioned that such flattening incorporates the expectation of higher-than previously anticipated increases in shortterm interest rates, which contributes to lower inflation expectations and inflation risk premia for longer-term rates.",
        "Some members highlighted that the latter exhibited some volatility.",
        "One member considered that, looking ahead, global financial conditions will continue to be favored by the Federal Reserve’s accommodative policy stance.",
        "As for emerging economies, some members said that the global environment implies a higher external demand for these economies, as well as higher inflationary risks.",
        "One member added that said environment also implies financial conditions that could be tighter and more volatile for these economies.",

        "Another member highlighted that capital flows to fixed income assets in emerging economies registered moderate inflows, mainly to China, while those to equity assets registered moderate mixed flows.",
        "Most members considered the possibility of risk for global financial markets.",
        "One member pointed out that this would lead to an earlier-thanexpected tightening of monetary policy, which could compromise economic recovery.",
        "Another member added that central baseline scenarios for the global economy show a greater recovery, although differentiated among countries, with uncertain effects on inflation and financial markets that are prone to generate episodes of volatility.",
        "He/she stated that high uncertainty prevails in financial markets, which is associated with the levels of inflation in the United States, its outlook, and its implications for the yield curve.",
        "He/she also stated that, according to surveys among investors, an additional risk for financial markets is a possible monetary policy mistake in that country.",

        "He/she stated that in severe crises, it is the number of firms that go bankrupt what directly affects employment.",
        "In this regard, he/she mentioned that it is worrisome that from May 2019 to September 2020, over 20% of all the firms in the country closed, which contrasts with an increase in firm creation of only business closures of 21.2% and a rate of firm creation of only 2.8%.",
        "Another member explained that, after contracting by 12.5 million between February and April 2020, formal and informal employment had recovered by 11.5 million in April to the labor market during the first four months of the year.",

        "One member noted that the dynamics of the growth rate for 2021 are partly due to a rebound effect generated by last year’s contraction.",
        "Some members stated that the recovery would be driven by the strength of external demand, advances in the vaccination process, and the reopening of activities.",
        "One member mentioned that differences between sectors are expected to continue.",

        "The majority of members pointed out that inflation in Mexico continues to be affected by the direct and indirect effects of the pandemic.",
        "They mentioned that inflationary pressures are associated with base effects, as in the case of energy prices, with reallocation of spending, with international commodity prices, and with other supply pressures.",
        "Regarding the latter, one member stated that, in response to such pressures, the prices of wheat, corn and soybean by-products have increased.",
        "He/she added that the reallocation of spending generated an increase in mobile phone and internet services’ prices.",

        "He/she added that suppliers of goods and services have shown a lower response capacity, as well as delays and product shortages.",
        "He/she argued that, due to the pandemic, supply has less capacity to absorb the growth in demand without exerting pressures on prices.",
        "One member considered that, due to the unprecedented nature of the crisis, it is difficult to foresee the size and duration of supplyrelated pressures and their interaction with demand patterns.",
        "In this context, most members mentioned that headline inflation has been close to 6% and that it is significantly above Banco de México’s target.",
        "One member argued that the current levels are due to the significant price changes that a reduced number of products have registered and, therefore, in his/her view, the 6% increase is far from being generalized.",
        "He/she noted that some prices that had registered the highest increases have already started to stabilize.",
        "Regarding non-core inflation, some members mentioned that it was affected by a decrease in energy inflation and by upward pressures on livestock and agricultural product prices.",
        "One member pointed out that the latter have undergone pressures from adverse weather events and from a strong increase in their demand.",
        "Another member noted that non-core inflation has gone from 2.6% in January to double-digit levels since April.",
        "Most members highlighted the rise in core inflation, which is associated with the increase in services inflation and the persistently high levels expressed their concern about core inflation’s resistance to decline.",
        "They explained that since May trended upwards.",
        "One member emphasized that the core component has shown persistence despite the ample slack conditions.",
        "He/she noted that non-food merchandise inflation remains high, while food merchandise inflation increased.",
        "He/she added that an upward trend can be observed in the core component, which is foreseen to continue for several months.",
        "Another member highlighted that, while between April 2018 and February 2021, core inflation had not exceeded 4%, since March it has remained above that level.",
        "He/she argued that this component faces problems that go beyond base effects.",
        "He/she noted that, when controlling for seasonal effects, monthly inflation has increased rapidly in a considerable proportion of merchandises and services.",
        "He/she explained that the prices of certain merchandises, such as clothing and footwear, have been adjusted upwards to recover from the low profit margins registered during the pandemic.",
        "One member stated that the prices of 75% of merchandises are increasing at a rate of over 4% and show annual variations of around 6% as a whole.",
        "Most members noted that, with the reopening of activities, services inflation has reversed the downward trend it had shown during most of 2020.",
        "One member mentioned that it has increased consistently since the beginning of 2021.",
        "Another member added that this change in trend is a risk to inflation given that the depressed demand so far has contributed to contain price increases in this item.",
        "As the economy opens during the post-pandemic period, more pressures on these prices will be observed, derived from new consumption patterns.",
        "This same member indicated that, although supercore inflation remains on target, it is an analytical concept that needs to be taken with caution.",
        "He/she recalled that it is interpreted as the one that responds more to the economic cycle.",
        "He/she mentioned that its current level of 3.1% indicates that, since the economy remained in the contraction part of the cycle for almost 3 years, the pressure on prices that are more susceptible to cyclical factors is low.",
        "However, he/she stated that this indicator does not show a level compatible with the inflation target, given that it only reflects 35% of the generic items of core inflation.",
        "He/she added that supercore inflation would have to show a higher level, in view of a higher economic growth rate, even if the latter were due to a base effect.",
        "expectations for the end of 2021 increased once expectations remained stable at levels above the 3% target.",
        "Some members mentioned that shortterm expectations are the most sensitive to the observed data.",
        "One member indicated that inflation levels above those anticipated contributed to the increase in inflation expectations for this year and the next one.",
        "Some members highlighted that, based on different surveys, the median of expectations for the next 12 months remains close to 3%.",
        "One member added that said median even decreased gradually and is close to the target.",
        "He/she added that, although inflation expectations drawn from market instruments increased at the margin, they are still within the variability interval, which suggests that markets anticipate that the inflation increase will be transitory.",
        "In turn, another member detailed that in Banco de México’s latest survey, specialists assigned a probability of 54% to inflation locating above 5.1% at the end of 2021, and a probability of contradicts the projection that the target would be attained in mid-2022.",
        "In addition, he/she specified that, after new inflation data for June are released, analysts are anticipated to assign an even higher probability of inflation locating very much above the target level this year and the following one.",
        "incorporating the recent behavior of inflation, the new expected trajectories for headline and core inflation for the following quarters are higher than those published in the Quarterly Report January–March 2021.",
        "He/she added that headline inflation is forecast to lie around the 3% target in the third quarter of 2022.",
        "One member recalled that, in the monetary policy release of May, headline and core inflation were anticipated to converge to the target in the second quarter of 2022.",
        "He/she added that in the Quarterly Report January-March 2021 it was stressed that the central forecast scenario for inflation excluded additional pressures and that their materialization would imply a more adverse scenario for inflation.",
        "He/she pointed out that, in the updated inflation forecast, the convergence of headline inflation to its target would be delayed until the third quarter of 2022 and that core inflation’s convergence would also take longer.",
        "Some members highlighted that, since the previous monetary policy decision, the inflation trajectory for the following eight quarters has been revised significantly upwards.",
        "One member underlined that the central proposition of the last Quarterly Report and of many analysts is that the current inflationary pressures generated by shocks and the arithmetic effect derived from a low base of comparison are transitory, and thus they should begin to dissipate over the next twelve months.",
        "However, skepticism persists over the possibility of inflation converging to the target starting in the second quarter of next year.",
        "The aforementioned due to the high uncertainty and to a balance of risks for inflation biased to the upside.",
        "He/she expressed his/her concern about the magnitude of the deviation from previous forecasts being observed once again, in particular, regarding the convergence of inflation to its target.",
        "Inflation expectations could deteriorate given a continuous adjustment of the forecasts towards higher inflation.",
        "pressures are anticipated to be transitory.",
        "Some members highlighted the moderation in energy prices, the stabilization in international commodity prices, and that the effects related to reallocation of spending are one-off.",
        "One member mentioned the fading of increases in agricultural and livestock product prices.",
        "Another member mentioned that inflation dynamics in Mexico followed the global upward trend, although more noticeably.",
        "He/she pointed out that a reversal in the inflation trend starting from May had already been previously expected, due to the fading of base effects.",
        "Nevertheless, he/she pointed out that, after considering the most recent data, currently a new rebound in inflation is anticipated, which may continue until August or September, due to unanticipated factors, different from the base effect.",
        "He/she highlighted that, unlike other emerging economies, the increase in inflation in Mexico between January and May largely responded to structural factors.",
        "One member pointed out that, in line with the new forecasts, a very significant base effect could be observed during the fourth quarter of activity is estimated to moderate in 2022, coinciding in general terms with the moment in which some base effects of inflation will fade.",
        "Among upward risks to inflation, most members highlighted the possibility of a higher external inflation, high persistence of core inflation, episodes of exchange rate depreciation, cost- related pressures or reallocation of spending.",
        "Some members added possible volatility episodes in financial markets.",
        "One member highlighted the risk of droughts exerting pressure on agricultural and livestock prices.",
        "Another member mentioned a more dynamic economic activity.",
        "One member considered that there are risks regarding the recovery of pent-up demand, especially in the service sector.",
        "Regarding downward risks, some members mentioned the effects of the negative output gap and greater social distancing measures.",
        "One member emphasized the possibility of an exchange rate appreciation.",
        "Most members considered that the balance of risks that could affect the anticipated path for inflation within the forecast horizon is to the upside.",
        "One member mentioned that short and medium-term risks should be clearly differentiated.",
        "He/she pointed out that the balance of risks in the short term has deteriorated considerably.",
        "Nonetheless, he/she argued that medium-term risks, albeit remaining high, have improved given the stability of the exchange rate, the containment of energy prices, and a better outlook for international commodity prices.",
        "Another member highlighted that risks to non-core inflation are also biased to the upside, due to: i) new supply shocks associated to both increases in energy and commodity prices, and in transportation costs, and ii) pressures on agricultural and livestock product prices.",
        "Most members indicated that domestic financial markets have exhibited a stable behavior.",
        "One member mentioned economic growth and its expectations, sound public finances, a lower current account deficit, and a less restrictive monetary policy stance among the factors that have contributed to said behavior.",
        "However, the majority of members pointed out that the Federal Reserve's latest decision led to certain volatility.",
        "In this regard, they highlighted the recent exchange rate depreciation, after it attained a level close to 19.70 pesos per dollar.",
        "However, one member highlighted that, at the margin, the Mexican peso has started to appreciate again.",
        "Most members noted that shorter-term interest decreased.",
        "One member stated that this was due to expectations of a less accommodative monetary policy stance in the near future.",
        "Some members highlighted the favorable performance of the stock market.",
        "One member mentioned that default premia showed an improvement.",
        "Another member considered that although outflows of foreign investors' holdings of government securities have been absorbed by local financial intermediaries and investors, a cautious environment persists, which could translate into a lower appetite for local assets.",
        "One member recalled that China's inclusion in various global fixed income indexes has contributed to the fact that it has received two thirds of the fixed income flows towards emerging economies in the last 18 months.",
        "He/she stated that although part of this adjustment may be transitory, the low level of participation of foreign investors in primary auctions of government securities in Mexico stands out.",
        "Another member noted that greater external volatility and, in the medium term, lower monetary stimuli at a global level, could exert pressure on the exchange rate and affect capital flows.",
        "The majority of members mentioned that bank credit has continued to contract.",
        "Some members highlighted the decline in consumer credit and in lending to SMEs.",
        "One member noted that this has occurred despite the ample liquidity available to banks.",
        "Another member added that this has taken place in an environment of tight financing conditions and that the decline in credit is also a result of lower demand due to a precautionary behavior and the lower payment capacity of SMEs in the face of the economic slowdown.",
        "He/she emphasized that only mortgage lending continues registering positive growth rates.",
        "One member pointed out that since since the beginning of the pandemic, it has contracted proportionally more than during the 20082009 financial crisis.",
        "He/she noted that, despite the measures taken by the authorities, credit so far has been weak and that intermediation margins are still above pre-pandemic levels.",
        "Some members pointed out that recent studies show that, both in advanced and emerging economies, credit is highly important for a faster and more robust economic recovery, and that its absence will affect consumption and investment.",
        "One member stated that this would have negative consequences for the recovery of sales, for critical sectors such as construction, and that it could affect the reactivation of SMEs.",
        "Another member mentioned that, in a context of high uncertainty, a tightening of financial conditions could be counterproductive.",
        "In this regard, he/she considered essential to foster conditions that continue ensuring the efficiency and stability of the financial system, so that it encourages the adequate channeling of resources among economic agents.",
        "One member noted that the domestic sources of financing continued to expand at high rates in response to the demand for liquidity from households and firms.",
        "He/she added that in April and May there was a reactivation of corporate debt issuance in the domestic and foreign markets.",
        "Regarding credit risk, he/she mentioned that although delinquency rates remain at low levels, those corresponding to housing and corporate lending have increased.",
        "He/she considered it crucial for development banks to resume their countercyclical role as inducers of credit to the private sector in order to promote firms' recovery, mainly of SMEs, and to seize the space provided by their high capitalization levels.",
        "Most members of Banco de México's Governing Board highlighted that, although the shocks that have affected inflation are of a transitory nature, given their variety, magnitude, and the extended time frame in which they have been affecting inflation, they may pose a risk to the price formation process.",
        "They deemed necessary to strengthen the monetary policy stance by increasing the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 25 basis points to 4.25%, to attain an orderly adjustment of prices and enable the convergence of inflation to its target.",
        "Some members voted for leaving the target unchanged at monetary policy implementation will depend on the evolution of the factors that have an trajectories within the forecast horizon, and on One member argued that in small open emerging economies, such as Mexico, which supplement their domestic savings with external sources of financing, it is essential to maintain a solid macroeconomic policy stance that fosters an orderly adjustment in the economy and attracts capital.",
        "In this regard, he/she stated that monetary policy should contribute to contain increases in risk premia along the yield curve, as well as possible adjustments to the Mexican peso exchange rate, in addition to maintaining low and stable inflation around its target.",
        "He/she also pointed out that the shocks that have recently affected inflation pose significant challenges to monetary policy implementation.",
        "He/she highlighted that it must be ensured that relative price adjustments take place in an orderly manner and that possible effects on the economy's price formation process and on inflation expectations are avoided.",
        "He/she added that the baseline scenario for inflation foreseen in the Quarterly Report did nor incorporate additional pressures, and that their materialization would imply a more adverse scenario for inflation.",
        "He/she highlighted that in said report the Governing Board indicated that it would determine its monetary policy stance with the aim of guaranteeing an orderly price adjustment and ensuring the convergence of inflation to the 3% target.",
        "In this regard, the most recent information clearly shows considerable additional pressures for headline and core inflation and a revision of its forecasts for the next eight quarters.",
        "He/she considered that a tightening of the monetary policy stance will contribute to a downward trajectory of headline and core inflation towards 3%.",
        "Another member considered that the internal and external outlook for inflation has continued to deteriorate significantly.",
        "In particular, he/she pointed out that although inflationary pressures are largely, but not exclusively, explained by supply shocks, their transitory character can clearly turn out to be more lasting than previously anticipated.",
        "In view of this, he/she emphasized that it must be ensured that second-round effects are not generated and that the risk of expectations being contaminated or of the credibility of the Central Bank's commitment to the convergence of inflation to its target becoming deteriorated, is avoided.",
        "He/she pointed out that a significant correction in the observed data and in inflation forecasts cannot be ignored and requires a timely adjustment of the monetary policy stance.",
        "He/she stated that, although most analysts do not anticipate an increase in the reference rate in this decision, the minimum adjustment made is necessary and pertinent to give a clear and strong signal of the Central Bank's commitment to primary mandate.",
        "He/she added that price stability must be reinforced to avoid adverse consequences on the population, particularly on the most vulnerable.",
        "He/she emphasized the importance of the monetary policy statement mentioning the adjustment of inflation forecasts with respect to the trajectories in the last Quarterly Report, the delay in the convergence to the target, and that the balance of risks for inflation is biased to the upside.",
        "He/she added that this decision does not necessarily imply the beginning of a monetary tightening cycle but an adjustment, and that the following decisions will be taken accordingly, as new information emerges.",
        "One member noted that the absolute and relative monetary policy stances suggest that the room for lowering the reference rate has been exhausted and that the monetary stimuli should even be reduced.",
        "He/she considered that signaling that the downward cycle will continue in order to support economic activity may be very risky.",
        "He/she stressed that when implementing monetary policy, the costs of the decisions taken should be evaluated.",
        "In the face of uncertainty due to unanticipated shocks or measurement problems in the indicators, the cost for price stability is lower when mistakenly maintaining a conservative position than when mistakenly taking a riskier position.",
        "He/she considered that the improved economic outlook reduces the need for further monetary stimulus measures.",
        "He/she added that the monetary policy stance that was needed in 2020, when the economy contracted 8.5% and inflation ended at 3.15%, is different from what is needed now, given that growth is expected to be 6% and inflation could close the year nearly at double its target level.",
        "The urgency that had previously favored the reduction in the reference rate loses more strength in light of the deterioration in the balance of risks to inflation.",
        "He/she pointed out that the credibility of monetary policy and the Central Institute's commitment to price stability must be maintained, avoiding any notion that the Central Bank has, a _de facto dual mandate.",
        "He/she stated_ that recent and estimated future inflationary pressures, both domestic and external, in an international scenario prone to volatility and less accommodative monetary conditions worldwide, require immediate action.",
        "He/she pointed out that this decision shows that Banco de México is prepared to make difficult decisions, consistent with its primary mandate.",
        "He/she added that this will place the Central Bank in a better position to ensure that the expected trajectory for inflation materializes.",
        "He/she highlighted that given the uncertainty and a balance of risks for inflation that is clearly biased to the upside, in the following decisions it will be necessary to show resolve in order to avoid a deanchoring of expectations and a greater vulnerability to external or internal shocks.",
        "Another member mentioned that the monetary policy stance has been calibrated in an unprecedented context, ensuring the convergence of inflation to its target within the horizon in which monetary policy operates.",
        "He/she noted that, given that the economy is in a non-traditional cycle, there are no structural demand pressures that imply generalized price increases.",
        "He/she pointed out that it is important to reflect on monetary policy ability to respond to the supply shocks being confronted, considering that there are factors that are beyond the control of the monetary authority and that in the short term may have an impact on inflation.",
        "He/she stated that the Central Bank should seek to keep mediumand long-term inflation expectations anchored in order to avoid second-round effects.",
        "In this regard, he/she mentioned that, according to estimates, monetary policy implementation had, up to that point, maintained medium- and long-term inflation expectations anchored.",
        "He/she considered the importance of monitoring that this continues to take place, and that monetary policy should be conducted in such a way as to enable the orderly convergence of inflation to its target.",
        "He/she noted that the best way to meet this objective is by following the prudent, cautious, gradual and predictable approach that has characterized monetary policy.",
        "He/she emphasized that acting in a prudent and gradual manner is not synonymous with being tolerant, and that the Central Bank has the tools and experience to act in a timely manner, and even preemptively, if necessary, in order to ensure that inflation converges to its target in the horizon in which monetary policy operates.",
        "One member argued that, if the reference rate remains unchanged, the inflation target would not be jeopardized, because the factors that account for its recent increase are not only exogenous but also transitory.",
        "He/she stated that, in reality, monetary policy can do very little to offset price pressures caused by base effects and by external factors.",
        "He/she recalled that, when pressures are demandrelated, monetary policy can be more efficient, but that with an atypically high output gap and a labor market barely recovering, this type of pressures are limited, and that for this reason the current pressures actually come from abroad or are supply-related.",
        "He/she mentioned that, in contrast, an early withdrawal of the monetary stimulus would imply major costs for the economy in a context in which the recovery is still incipient and fragile.",
        "He/she stressed that said cost would fall on the margins of the economy that are currently more damaged, affecting the recovery of credit and removing an essential support for the reactivation of many small- and medium-size enterprises, and delaying the still incipient recovery of the aggregate demand components most affected by the pandemic: private consumption and investment.",
        "Finally, he/she recalled that Banco de México’s goal is to preserve low and stable inflation, in an efficient manner, that is, not at all costs, but rather at the lowest cost possible.",
        "In this regard, he/she considered that in the current juncture, Banco de México must emphasize and inform comprehensively and clearly about the transitory nature of the ongoing inflationary shocks, which would contribute to provide certainty to markets as to the framework of monetary policy implementation and would reinforce the anchoring of inflation expectations without harming the possibilities of economic recovery.",
        "Although the shocks that have affected inflation are expected to be of a transitory nature, given their variety, magnitude, and the extended time frame in which they have been affecting inflation, they may pose a risk to the price formation process.",
        "In this context, it was deemed necessary to strengthen the monetary policy stance in order to avoid adverse effects on inflation expectations, attain an orderly adjustment of relative prices, and enable the convergence of inflation to the 3% target.",
        "With the presence of all its members, the Governing Board decided by majority to increase the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 25 basis points to unchanged at 4.00%.",
        "Looking ahead, monetary policy implementation will depend on the evolution of the factors that have an incidence on inflation, on its foreseen trajectories within the forecast horizon, and on its expectations.",
        "The Governing Board will take the necessary actions based on incoming information in order for the policy rate to be consistent with the orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to the 3% target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates.",
        "It is necessary to safeguard the institutional framework, strengthen the macroeconomic fundamentals and adopt the necessary actions on both monetary and fiscal policy fronts, to enable a better adjustment of domestic financial markets and of the economy as a whole.",
        "Alejandro Díaz de León-Carrillo, Irene EspinosaCantellano, and Jonathan Ernest Heath-Constable voted in favor of increasing the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 25 basis points to overnight interbank interest rate unchanged at Inflation has been subject to significant pressures in recent months.",
        "Most of them, however, seem to be associated with supply-related problems and to changes in consumption patterns, as a result of the pandemic -which remains the most important challenge- and thus I believe will hardly be solved through monetary policy.",
        "It is reasonable to conclude that these pressures are transitory and will decrease over time, as long as inflation expectations remain well anchored.",
        "Up to now, there is no evidence that medium- and long-term inflation expectations have been affected by the observed inflation shocks, and they are consistent with the time frame in which monetary policy operates.",
        "Under economic circumstances of high uncertainty, an unpredictable tightening of the monetary policy stance could be interpreted as a change in the cycle rather than a reinforcement of the current policy stance, which would lead to an even greater tightening of local financial conditions, and therefore be counterproductive.",
        "In my opinion, and given the nontraditional cycle we face, the best way to meet our constitutional objective is to be consistent with our communication and monetary policy approach, which has been characterized for being prudent, cautious, gradual, and predictable.",
        "I believe the decision to raise the interest rate was hasty.",
        "Although it is true that inflation is significantly above the Central Bank's target, it is also true that this is mainly due to base effects and supplyrelated factors.",
        "This implies two things: first, that these effects are transitory and, second, that monetary policy can do little to address them.",
        "A similar explanation had been put forward just three weeks earlier in the Quarterly Report.",
        "I therefore consider that this decision suggests an abrupt change in narrative, which sends the signal of an erratic and unpredictable behavior by the Bank.",
        "The fact that no analyst had anticipated a rate increase also points in that direction.",
        "On the other hand, it has been said that the rate increase could contribute to anchor inflation expectations.",
        "However, this abrupt change could also have an undesirable and counterproductive effect on inflation and its expectations by suggesting that shocks are of a more permanent nature, which could negatively affect the price formation process.",
        "The majority mentioned that global economic activity continued to recover during the third heterogeneously across countries, associated with the evolution of the pandemic and with spending programs.",

        "He/she delved into the shortage of inputs slowing down production in certain sectors, which is uncommon during an early upward stage of the economic cycle.",

        "Some members underlined the heterogeneity of those revisions across regions and countries.",
        "They noted the upward adjustments for 2021 for the euro area and Latin America, and the downward adjustments for the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom and some emerging economies in Asia.",
        "One member pointed out that, according to the International Monetary Fund, advanced economies are expected to recover the growth trajectory exhibited prior to the pandemic, while emerging economies, with the exception of China, are foreseen to continue growing below pre-pandemic forecasts, even until 2024.",
        "Some members pointed out that there is concern about the economic recovery.",
        "One member considered that, given the persistence of negative effects, there are still doubts about the velocity of the recovery.",
        "He/she added that the heterogeneity across the growth outlooks is a cause for concern.",
        "Another member emphasized that the adjustment in the outlook indicates fragility in the recovery and suggests risks to the economic activity.",
        "Among global risks, most members mentioned those associated with the pandemic, inflationary pressures, and adjustments in monetary and financial conditions.",
        "Some members pointed out the imbalances between supply and demand, as a result of the reopening of economies, economic stimuli programs, the change in consumption patterns, and the disruption in global supply chains.",
        "One member noted that the atypical nature of the recovery is causing frictions, which have detonated risks to growth and inflation.",
        "Another member highlighted the role of the pandemic in inflationary pressures, which can be divided in two stages.",
        "First: i) unprecedented shocks with forecast errors in economic activity and inflation; ii) the abrupt shutdown of activities prompted businesses to lower their costs, inventories, investment and their workforce; iii) social impact and political tensions, which contributed to the implementation of large spending stimuli in advanced economies; iv) a reallocation of household expenditure from services towards merchandise; and v) a profound impact in the labor market.",
        "Second, i) a faster recovery and a considerable increase in fiscal support programs in the United States, generating bottlenecks and pressures on world trade and on durable goods’ prices; ii) the recovery of the services’ sector as a result of vaccine availability; iii) limitations in production; and iv) a high leverage after a long period of historically low interest rates, which, in addition to fiscal expansion, poses challenges to financial stability.",
        "As to the lack of flexibility in production, he/she pointed out that the impact on supply chains, the lack of investment in hydrocarbons due to the energy transition, and the end of the negative effect on manufacturing prices that had been observed with China’s increasing participation in world trade.",
        "As to the labor market, he/she mentioned that the pandemic accelerated the outflow of certain workers from the labor force and generated lower participation in others.",
        "Similarly, it produced a change in relative wages as a result of risks of contagion.",
        "He/she expressed that, considering all of the above, world inflation dynamics responds both to the direct impact on production and to pressures due to the reallocation of spending and to spending programs.",
        "Most members mentioned that world inflation continued to be pressured by bottlenecks in production, the reallocation of spending towards merchandise, the rise in food and energy prices, the reopening of certain services, and by imbalances between supply and demand.",
        "One member added the impact of stimulus spending, the increase in ocean freight costs, and pressures on consumer durables.",
        "He/she emphasized the high annual change of the US producer price index, which registered 8.6% in September and October, and the pressures on consumer durables, for which inflation reached 6.96% in August 2021, as compared to -1.54% in February 2020.",
        "He/she also highlighted that said economy stands out for having had the largest spending stimulus programs implemented and for registering the highest inflation pressures in a broad range of products, as well as the highest levels of CPI inflation since 1990 (6.2%).",
        "He/she pointed out that these have contributed to raise inflation expectations of business and consumers, as well as expectations implicit in fixed-income markets.",
        "Another member stated that spot and future prices of different commodities continued increasing significantly.",
        "One member pointed out that the increase in international commodity prices is also due to climate-related factors.",
        "He/she added that the origin of all these factors is directly linked to the pandemic, and thus their effects will not last forever.",
        "Another member noted that in most economies, with a few exceptions, such as Japan, inflation is above the respective central bank targets.",
        "Most members mentioned that the adverse effects of global inflationary pressures are added that there is no consensus on this matter.",
        "Some members pointed out that pressures are anticipated to dissipate by the end of next year, depending on progress towards containing the pandemic.",
        "One member noted that some pressures, such as those on international prices of food and industrial inputs, have already started to dissipate.",
        "The majority highlighted that the horizon in which the pressures could affect inflation is uncertain and the risk of them affecting the price formation process.",
        "One member stated that it would be reflected in higher inflation expectations and in an earlier-than-anticipated or a faster withdrawal of monetary stimuli.",
        "He/she added that information from surveys in advanced economies suggests an increase in short-term expectations, while expectations drawn from longer-term financial instruments show moderate increases.",
        "Another member highlighted the magnitude of inflationary pressures and the broad range of products being affected.",
        "He/she added that the deterioration in the inflation outlook and the challenge it implies have been acknowledged by all central banks and that most of them have taken measures to address the issue.",
        "Most members pointed out that the central banks Some members noted that in these economies financial markets anticipate increases in interest rates in 2022.",
        "One member considered that the continuing stimulus in a significant number of central banks implies to some extent the recognition that increases in interest rates are not useful in solving supply problems, which are leading to the current levels inflation, and that they could indeed have a negative impact on the recovery.",
        "Another member noted that some central banks have already started to reduce their asset-purchase programs.",
        "One member mentioned that monetary conditions have started to become less accommodative.",
        "Another member highlighted that, despite the plans to gradually withdraw stimuli, there is still uncertainty over the duration of inflation pressures and the adjustment of markets.",

        "He/she added that this central bank stated that it would remain patient in view of the inflationary pressures, which it expects to be transitory, and given the evolution of the economic recovery, which is still incomplete.",
        "The majority pointed out that markets anticipate the first interest rate increase in 2022.",
        "One member pointed out that markets anticipate the first rate increase to take place in the last quarter of consistent with expectations of the members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), thus both foresee that the monetary stimulus will continue being significant for a long time.",
        "Another member underlined that, although FOMC expectations still point to an increase in interest rates in 2023, those drawn from financial instruments indicate that it could occur in 2022.",
        "Some members pointed out that Federal Reserve communications have mitigated the risk of a monetary policy surprise.",
        "One member argued that the larger monetary space in the United States and in other advanced economies, where inflation and inflation expectations had been below their targets for many years, allows them to be more patient, although they face the risk of undermining their credibility if it is perceived that they tolerate high levels of inflation.",
        "On the other hand, he/she mentioned that, in emerging economies, and in Mexico in particular, price formation can become rapidly contaminated by the shocks that have affected inflation.",

        "Some members noted that higher increases in reference rates have been observed in economies with macroeconomic imbalances.",

        "He/she mentioned that although some central banks have reacted to inflationary pressures with more significant interest rate increases, he/she clarified that these are countries that implemented highly expansionary fiscal policies and which now require more conservative monetary policies.",
        "Another member pointed out that only in those cases where inflation has taken place along with various macroeconomic imbalances, and there has been a higher elasticity of inflation expectations to the shocks from the pandemic, it has been necessary to remove the stimuli implemented last year.",
        "Additionally, he/she pointed out that, according to certain estimates, this has been the case among Latin American economies, where about one third of the inflation variance would be explained by idiosyncratic factors, and an additional one-third, by inflation expectations.",

        "Another member stated that, even without accounting for the effect of the labor outsourcing reform, the economy is facing a significant deceleration.",
        "Meanwhile, one member stated that the weakness of economic activity shows the fragility of the recovery, which is still far from complete.",
        "On the supply side, all members highlighted the contraction of services during the third quarter, partly reflecting the new regulation on labor outsourcing.",

        "Regarding internal pressures, he/she pointed out that the contamination of these shocks onto the price formation process must be monitored.",
        "Another member added the effect of the reversion to the trend in the prices of some goods and services.",
        "Most members indicated that, due to the deep economic integration with the United States, the higher levels of inflation in that country have contributed to the rebound in inflation in Mexico.",
        "One member highlighted that this has particularly affected food commodity prices.",

        "One member stated that it is very important to distinguish between annual figures which incorporate information of accumulated shocks in the past, from figures at the margin, which provide information on the most recent dynamics.",
        "In this regard, he/she considered that pressures at the margin on general and core inflation decreased between August and September, while in October some pressure was registered once more due to the decrease in the number of infections and the reactivation of spending.",
        "Another member indicated that monthly inflation in October was above expectations and registered the highest level for an October month since 1998.",
        "One member pointed out that from March to date, monthly inflation growth has been significantly above historical averages.",

        "Most members mentioned the recent increase in services inflation.",
        "One member expressed that service prices have continued with a reversal-to-trend process, which responds to a decline in the number of infections.",
        "He/she added that annualized two-year services inflation remained at 3%, and thus there does not seem to be a new shock or an additional source of pressure in this component.",
        "Another member highlighted that inflation of services other than education and housing is above 5%.",

        "Some members mentioned that non-core inflation has also been subject to pressures.",
        "One member noted that the biggest inflation surprises with respect to Banco de México's forecasts have concentrated in this component, mainly on the side of energy and some livestock products.",
        "Another member pointed out that energy prices remained stable at the margin, while certain pressures were registered in the agricultural and livestock products’ component, although he/she considered that these tend to be corrected in a relatively short period of time.",
        "Most members noted that expectations for headline and core inflation for 2021, for the next 12 months, and for the end of 2022, increased again, while longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable at levels above 3%.",
        "One member pointed out that expectations for 2022 are very close to the upper limit of the variability interval.",
        "He/she added that while expectations for 2023 and beyond have not deteriorated, it cannot be assumed that the divergence between short- and long-term expectations will be maintained, given the continuation of the current bubble and the difficulty in fighting it.",
        "Another member argued that the increasing inflation levels observed at least during the last 11 months have led to second-round effects, and they are contaminating short-term expectations and have begun to affect medium-term expectations.",
        "One member pointed out that inflation expectations drawn from market instruments for the short term have deteriorated.",
        "Another member said that inflation expectations for the next 6-10 years have continued to be anchored around 3%.",
        "Some mentioned that implied expectations in medium- and long-term bonds have increased.",
        "One member indicated that compensation for inflation and inflationary risk implied by 10-year bonds accumulated an increase of more than 100 basis points during the year, while the inflation risk premium was above the observed peak in January Most members pointed out that forecasts for headline and core inflation were revised upward, in particular for the short term.",
        "Some members mentioned that this was due to additional inflationary pressures.",

        "He/she added that the speed of inflation convergence has shown to be uncertain and that inflation expectations will be key in shaping this trend.",
        "One member noted that, although the negative output gap will prevail through most of 2022, it is not expected to offset the price pressures.",
        "He/she added that, although fiscal pressure in Mexico is lower than in other countries, it will also not mitigate any supplyand external-related pressures on domestic prices.",
        "Most members highlighted that the shocks that have affected inflation are mainly transitory.",
        "One member stated that these should begin to fade as health control measures advance.",
        "He/she added that while it has been difficult to estimate the duration and severity of the shocks, they are expected to decline by the second half of 2022.",
        "He/she added that medium- and long-term expectations remain anchored, consistent with the transitory nature of the pressures.",
        "He/she indicated that there are signs that some components of inflation have started to ease.",
        "Another member noted that at the beginning of the year, the pressures were associated with base effects, changes in consumption patterns, and with an adjustment in relative prices that resulted from a supply shock which had the characteristic of being asymmetric.",
        "He/she added that in the middle of the year, the economic reopening, the recovery of the prices of several services, the renewed tensions in energy prices, and the persistence in merchandise inflation also played a role.",
        "He/she pointed out that in September there were additional increases in food merchandise prices due to a higher imported inflation, which affected headline and core inflation given the importance of food items in the consumption basket.",
        "Thus, the number of shocks increased during the second half of the year, mainly due to supply effects that are not permanent.",
        "One member considered that although there is the argument that current pressures are basically due to supply shocks that will revert as the global supply chains operations normalize, said argument does not take into account that those pressures are also due to an expansion of demand generated by the stimuli implemented worldwide and to a reallocation of spending that might have more permanent effects.",
        "He/she added that, without the intervention of monetary authorities, the interaction of these two phenomena may result in an inflation with an equilibrium level above the one that it had before the pandemic.",
        "Another member mentioned that the debate over the temporary nature of inflation pressures is irrelevant given that, unlike the energy price shock in 2017, the current inflationary episode is the result of an accumulation of ongoing shocks that began before the pandemic and whose effects will transcend the pandemic.",
        "For this reason, he/she noted that the discussion should center on the duration and persistence of high inflation.",
        "One member pointed out that although the effects of inflationary pressures are expected to be transitory, considerable risks to price formation prevail worldwide, with a possible impact on inflation in Mexico, due to the persistent uncertainty about the duration of the shocks.",
        "This, in addition to the fact that such pressures have affected the prices of a wide range of products significantly.",
        "Among upward risks to inflation, most members highlighted external inflationary pressures, cost- agricultural and livestock product prices, as well as in energy prices.",
        "Some members added the persistence of high core inflation and an exchange rate depreciation.",
        "Some members mentioned the risk of a deterioration in medium- and long-term inflation expectations.",
        "One member added wage increases in the United States as external inflationary pressures.",
        "He/she highlighted the risk of less slack and a readjustment in the relative prices of services as a consequence of the economic reopening.",
        "Another member mentioned that the probability of inflationary pressures in Mexico and worldwide being more persistent than anticipated has increased.",
        "Among downward risks, some members pointed out the widening of the negative output gap, further social distancing measures, and an appreciation of the exchange rate.",
        "Most members considered that the balance of risks to inflation within the forecast horizon deteriorated with respect to the Most members noted that the peso exchange rate exhibited volatility and depreciated slightly.",
        "One member stated that this was due to increased risk aversion.",
        "However, he/she added that better trading conditions were observed in the foreign exchange market.",
        "Another member considered that financial markets were favored by the Federal Reserve's most recent decision.",
        "The majority of members stated that short-term interest rates increased and longer-term interest rates were influenced by external conditions.",
        "They mentioned that a flattening of the yield curve was observed.",
        "Some members stated that this was due to expectations of further increases in the reference rate.",
        "One member pointed out that, if monetary normalization in the United States begins earlier than expected, there could be episodes of volatility that could generate exchange rate pressures or wider spreads in the yield curve with respect to external government interest rates.",

        "Some members stated that sovereign risk indicators remained practically unchanged.",

        "One member noted that the proposed fiscal package for 2022 maintains a responsible fiscal balance.",
        "However, he/she added that public finances may be affected if weak investment persists due to the deterioration of the business climate, the effects of legislative initiatives, such as the one that seeks to reorganize the electricity sector, or the possible need to allocate additional budgetary resources to Pemex.",
        "He/she indicated that it is essential to address the factors that affect investment decisions necessary to generate inclusive and sustained growth.",
        "The majority of members noted that the weak performance of financing to the private sector continues.",
        "Some members highlighted the fall in consumer and business lending.",
        "One member stated that credit continues contracting due to factors beyond monetary policy, such as investors’ reluctance to invest.",
        "Another member pointed out that financing to Small- and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) remains about 12% below prepandemic levels and with negative annual growth rates.",
        "One member added that only mortgage lending continued to grow and that adjusted delinquency rates for consumer, housing and business loans continued to decline.",
        "Some members noted that domestic sources of financing were above pre-pandemic levels.",
        "Some members stated that the external sources of financing have become negative.",
        "One member pointed out that financing conditions are the tightest on record and that, while demand for credit is expected to recover, it remains below the levels seen even during the global financial crisis.",
        "Another member mentioned the recent increase in interest rates, especially for loans to smaller-size firms.",
        "The majority of members considers the shocks that have increased inflation to be mainly transitory.",
        "Nevertheless, the horizon in which they could affect it is unknown, and they have involved a wide range of products, while being of considerable magnitude.",
        "This poses greater risks to the price formation process and to inflation expectations.",
        "For this reason, it was deemed necessary to continue reinforcing the monetary policy stance, adjusting it to the trajectory required for inflation to converge to its 3% target within the forecast horizon.",
        "The majority thus decided to increase the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 25 basis points to 5%.",
        "Most members highlighted that, for the next monetary policy decisions, they will assess thoroughly the behavior of inflationary pressures as well as of all factors that have an incidence on the foreseen trajectory for inflation and its expectations.",
        "The latter, in order to adopt a policy rate that is consistent at all times with the trajectory needed to facilitate the orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to the 3% target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates as well as an adequate adjustment of the economy and financial One member stated that continuing increases in the reference rate will not stop pressures stemming from changes in consumption patterns or supply restrictions from taking place.",
        "He/she stated that the latter could even worsen due to the impact of higher rates on credit, business creation and, therefore, on the productive plant, which in the end would lead to a higher inflation instead of a lower one.",
        "He/she added that such rate increases have a negative impact on consumption, investment, credit, public finances and financial markets, making them not only ineffective, but also inefficient.",
        "He/she added that, given the fragility of the economic recovery, further monetary tightening could affect people's wellbeing.",
        "He/she expressed that the objective sought with the rate increases has not been achieved, since from June to date, inflation expectations for the end of the year and for 2022 have not ceased to increase.",
        "He/she mentioned that, in the face of an unprecedented economic context, it is important not to act in a mechanical manner, but rather to be more reflective and cautious.",
        "He/she pointed out that, as in Mexico, inflation in many economies has exceeded the forecasts of their central banks, but most of them have continued to grant monetary stimulus, acknowledging the inability of the tools available to combat the current pressures.",
        "He/she highlighted that the origin of inflation in Mexico is the same as in other countries, but that Mexico stands out for its fiscal discipline, which has relieved pressures on the sovereign risk premium and the exchange rate.",
        "He/she argued that this should allow Banco de México to implement a less restrictive monetary policy than other emerging economies, which has not been the case.",
        "He/she stated that global market conditions and the continuation of accommodative policy stances in the main central banks have opened a space for patience.",
        "In light of the outlook that the Federal Reserve will not begin its normalization process before the second half of normalization would reduce any future space for possible interest rate adjustments, which could lead to an unnecessarily restrictive position in the near future.",
        "He/she considered that communication with the public should play a more important role in explaining in detail the factors that give rise to inflation.",
        "Another member pointed out that it is necessary to act decisively and responsibly, and thus monetary policy actions must be gradual, not only in terms of magnitude but also of timing.",
        "He/she argued that this will allow monetary policy to be conducted more effectively given the unprecedented circumstances, and will help to maintain expectations anchored, by driving the reference rate through a gradual trajectory that will allow it to comply with the central bank’s priority mandate, within the horizon in which monetary policy operates.",
        "He/she pointed out that the inflationary pressures related to the pandemic have continued, and that although they cannot last indefinitely, they have shown to be more persistent.",
        "Nevertheless, he/she stated that there are elements that allow for acting with prudence and caution, particularly that the national economy, compared to other similar economies, has better macroeconomic balances, a solid international reserve position, more stable fiscal balances, and a higher ex-ante real interest rate.",
        "He/she also added that, given the collapse of demand conditions for loanable funds and the relative stability of the economy's total sources of financing, the estimated range for the neutral interest rate may have decreased.",
        "He/she stated that although there is significant uncertainty in its estimation, especially in the current unprecedented environment, the stated circumstances may suggest this decline.",
        "He/she pointed out that communication must continue to be used as a tool that, if implemented adequately, will help prevent market overreactions to monetary policy decisions, given the prevailing high uncertainty about the magnitude and persistence of the effects of the pandemic on the economy.",
        "He/she explained that inflation expectations have shown to be more sensitive to the changes in narrative that has accompanied the decisions, than to the rate increases, so that mechanical monetary policy responses may not have the same implications as in previous cycles.",
        "Taking all of the above into consideration, he/she underlined that, on this occasion, he/she considers it necessary to continue reinforcing monetary policy.",
        "One member mentioned that it is necessary to analyze whether a gradual approach is adequate, considering its lagged impact and its effects on inflation through the expectations channel.",
        "He/she highlighted that the discussion should focus on the persistence of high inflation, particularly of core inflation, in order to determine if convergence to the target will require a greater monetary policy tightening, both in terms of magnitude and timing.",
        "He/she pointed out that not acting in the face of a significant increase in inflation puts the anchoring of expectations and credibility at risk, which would not only make more difficult the attainment of the target, but also entail the enlargement of negative effects of shocks.",
        "For this reason, any increase in inflation must be matched with proportional adjustments in the monetary policy stance.",
        "He/she stated that the margins available to go beyond monetary neutrality must be analyzed and the boundary between the neutral and restrictive range of the reference rate must be calibrated.",
        "He/she argued that the relative monetary policy stance will gain more relevance in decision making, because the sources of external financing have become negative and capital flows are more sensitive to interest rate spreads.",
        "He/she highlighted that the pace of monetary adjustment must be transmitted effectively along the yield curve so that inflation expectations converge to the target but avoiding overreactions in financial markets.",
        "He/she stated that an eventual increase in the speed of adjustment must be of a determined duration to rule out an aggressive and prolonged cycle, which, in view of the expected adjustments in the Federal Reserve's reference rate next year, could lead to an overly restrictive policy stance in face of a weak economic recovery.",
        "He/she emphasized that clear, transparent and timely communication about the purpose of monetary policy actions generates greater credibility, strengthens monetary policy passthrough mechanisms, and increases their effectiveness.",
        "He/she mentioned that since the forecasted trajectory for inflation convergence requires maintaining a cycle of interest rate increases, forward guidance must be more explicit about said adjustments.",
        "For this reason, the convenience of publishing with each monetary policy announcement the foreseen path for the reference rate which is consistent with the board’s inflation forecast for the following eight quarters, as many central banks do.",
        "He/she added that, although less complete, another option would be to communicate the average of the reference rate for the analysis horizon.",
        "Lastly, he/she emphasized that, given the current scenario, communication on its own does not work, since the basis for a credible regime is a firm response, preventive and consistent in the face of inflationary pressures.",
        "Another member considered that, given the evolution of inflation and its expectations, and the possibility of a greater persistence of inflationary pressures, the central bank must act in a clear and decisive manner, in order to contain any impact on the price formation process that may lead to the deanchoring of medium- and long-term expectations.",
        "He/she expressed that central banks should avoid adapting higher inflation expectations by wrongly extending the monetary stimulus.",
        "He/she argued that failure to act now may lead to inflation reaching a higher equilibrium level than before.",
        "He/she pointed out that the main challenge is to assess the appropriate pace for withdrawing the monetary stimulus to ensure the convergence of inflation to the He/she argued that, based on available information and the foreseen trajectory for inflation, the monetary stimulus should be cut by 50 basis points.",
        "However, he/she pointed out that accelerating the pace in an environment of high uncertainty may have undesirable effects on markets.",
        "He/she noted that, given the high level of uncertainty, maintaining a gradual approach such as the one implemented, allows adjustments to be made in a timely and prudent manner in order to ensure an orderly convergence to the inflation target.",
        "However, he/she acknowledged that, although the strategy implemented is gradual, it also increases the risk of having to make a larger discrete adjustment in future monetary policy decisions.",
        "He/she stated that the monetary policy stance is consistent with an ex-ante real interest rate of around 1.5%, in accommodative territory and below the estimated neutral interest rate of 2.6%.",
        "He/she highlighted that this offers room to make the necessary and sufficient adjustments.",
        "As to the monetary policy statement, he/she pointed out that it should stress the additional shocks and the reasons for the deterioration in the balance of risks for inflation, as well as point out that the purpose of the decision is to prevent second-round effects from strengthening.",
        "He/she argued that this will allow Banco de México to be in a better position to face additional risks in a flexible manner.",
        "One member stated that the pandemic has implied a unique challenge for economic activity and inflation.",
        "Inflation has faced multiple shocks in 2021, and has become a global and domestic challenge.",
        "He/she highlighted that headline and core inflation forecasts have increased significantly on several occasions throughout the year, and once again on this occasion, in response to additional inflationary pressures.",
        "He/she argued that the above points to the need to continue adopting a trajectory for the interest rate target that strengthens the monetary policy stance.",
        "He/she added that, considering the simultaneity and magnitude of the shocks that have affected headline and core inflation and the high levels they have reached, as well as the uncertainty of the horizon over which they may affect inflation, the monetary policy stance must continue to be reinforced, adjusting it to the trajectory required for inflation to converge to its 3% target within the forecast horizon.",
        "He/she expressed that this strategy of monetary policy response is necessary to keep inflation expectations anchored, induce orderly conditions in the foreign exchange market, and contain risk premia in fixed-income instruments.",
        "He/she added that Mexico faces important external inflationary pressures and the oncoming effects of greater global financial restrictions.",
        "He/she pointed out that those economies, such as Mexico, that complement their domestic savings with external sources must maintain a solid macroeconomic stance.",
        "In this regard, he/she considered that monetary policy should contribute to maintain inflation around its target, promoting an orderly adjustment of the economy, the foreign exchange market and the yield curve, and avoiding capital outflows.",
        "He/she argued that tolerating high inflation levels well above the target without further reinforcing the monetary policy stance would affect price formation and lead to a significant deterioration of domestic financial markets, further complicating and increasing the cost of inflation convergence to its target, and jeopardizing the hard-earned credibility.",
        "Finally, given the complex outlook for inflation, he/she emphasized that Banco de México must reinforce its commitment to comply with its constitutional mandate of preserving the domestic currency’s purchasing power.",
        "The shocks that have increased inflation are largely considered to be transitory.",
        "Nevertheless, the horizon in which they could affect it is unknown, and they have involved a wide range of products, while being of considerable magnitude.",
        "This poses greater risks to the price formation process and to inflation expectations.",
        "For this reason, it was deemed necessary to continue reinforcing the monetary policy stance, adjusting it to the trajectory required for inflation to converge to its 3% target within the forecast horizon.",
        "The Governing Board decided to increase the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 25 basis points to 5%.",
        "For the next monetary policy decisions, the Governing Board will assess thoroughly the behavior of inflationary pressures as well as of all factors that have an incidence on the foreseen trajectory for inflation and its expectations.",
        "The latter, in order to adopt a policy rate that is consistent at all times with the trajectory needed to facilitate the orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to the policy operates as well as an adequate adjustment of the economy and financial markets.",
        "Alejandro Díaz de León, Galia Borja, Irene Espinosa, and Jonathan Heath voted in favor of increasing the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 25 basis points to 5.00%.",
        "Gerardo Esquivel voted in favor of leaving the target for the overnight interbank interest rate unchanged at 4.75%.",
        "The current unprecedented economic context calls for a non-mechanical response.",
        "Many central banks are facing inflationary pressures, but most have opted for maintaining the monetary stimulus, acknowledging the inability to fight them with the available tools.",
        "Due to its global nature, the inflationary process is similar in different economies.",
        "However, Mexico differs from other countries in the sense that it has maintained fiscal discipline, which relieves pressure on the exchange rate and the sovereign risk premium.",
        "This macroeconomic balance gives us a room that other emerging economies lack and which has not been used.",
        "Moreover, the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy stance will remain accommodative for a long period.",
        "Thus, acting too soon in regards to our own normalization process may reduce future room for maneuver and lead to an unnecessarily restrictive policy stance in the near future.",
        "In addition to being ineffective and inefficient, interest rate increases may also be counterproductive.",
        "From June to date, shortterm inflation expectations have not ceased to be revised upwards, so the goal pursued with interest rate increases has not been achieved.",
        "The majority noted that global economic activity continues to recover heterogeneously across countries, associated with vaccine availability and the amount of stimulus spending.",
        "Some members added structural factors of each economy.",
        "One member mentioned that most timely indicators of global economic activity show significant rebounds.",
        "Some members noted that economic activity and labor markets in various countries and regions are still affected by social distancing measures.",

        "One member added that this will allow it to reach its pre-pandemic output level towards the end of this year.",
        "Another member underlined that additional support packages are being evaluated, with infrastructure spending for up to 10 years, which also include tax increases to partially offset the higher levels of spending.",
        "Some members pointed out that the recovery is expected to be weaker in the euro area and Japan.",
        "One member stated that it is expected that it will take until 2023 for many emerging economies to regain their pre-pandemic levels.",
        "Among the risks to global economic activity, most members highlighted those associated with the pandemic and a higher-than-expected increase in inflation.",
        "Some members mentioned that there could be disruptions in production and supply chains.",
        "One member emphasized the importance of ensuring a broad and inclusive distribution of vaccines that would contribute to an orderly reestablishment of these chains.",
        "He/she warned that, otherwise, the recovery will continue to be heterogeneous and would favor the emergence of disruptions in the provision of inputs or commodities, with unfavorable effects on output and prices.",
        "Another member added the uncertainty about the type of inflationary pressures that may arise in the United States as a risk.",
        "As for the risks for emerging economies, most members pointed out those associated with the vaccination process, more restrictive financial conditions, and All members pointed out that global inflation rose due to recent pressures on commodity prices, especially energy-related ones, and to base effects, and cost-related pressures.",
        "Most members added that supply chain disruptions and the economic recovery process also exerted an influence.",
        "Some members stated that pressures on world inflation are anticipated to be limited and transitory due to economic and labor market weakness and the fading of base effects.",
        "One member mentioned that the most recent forecasts by international organizations suggest that price pressures will be short-lived, due to the wide slack conditions in most economies, and to the gradual fading away of base effects.",
        "Another member highlighted the impact of the recovery of economies of systemic importance such as China and the United States.",
        "One member added supply factors, including poor harvests and precautionary stockpiling.",
        "Some members noted that in most advanced economies, headline and core inflation remain below their targets, except for the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom.",
        "One member noted that in these countries the increases in inflation have been considered to be transitory.",
        "Most members mentioned that higher levels of inflation are expected in the United States.",
        "One member stated that the positive output gap that is expected for the US economy could exert upward pressures on inflation and interest rates.",
        "Regarding emerging economies, he/she noted that in most of them inflation has increased recently due to the increase in commodity prices, to supply shocks, and to exchange rate depreciations.",
        "Most members mentioned that greater pressures on prices could arise as a result of disruptions in production and supply chains.",
        "Some members noted that due to the effects derived from the pandemic, these chains are less resilient and have less capacity to absorb increases in demand without exerting pressures on prices.",
        "One member mentioned that world inflation is expected to be higher than at the beginning of the year.",
        "He/she noted that several global companies have warned about the possibility of raising their prices in 2021 and 2022 due to higher input costs, and he/she considered that the balance of risks for global inflation has deteriorated.",
        "Another member added that it is foreseeable that the supply of raw materials will tend to increase, thus contributing to lower inflationary pressures.",
        "He/she considered that since pressures on prices are transitory, longer-term inflation expectations should not be affected.",
        "He/she considered that for emerging economies, it will be important to monitor that the increase in inflation is indeed transitory and pointed out that inflation expectations for 2022 reveal, in general, lower levels than those anticipated for 2021.",
        "He/she added that the fact that some of the main economies have made progress with the vaccination and containment of the pandemic, has led to more favorable growth expectations and increases in the demand for various inputs.",
        "He/she considered that, in a context of global disruptions in supply chains, it is logical that the heterogeneous economic recovery process is also resulting in some bottlenecks in the provision of inputs.",
        "He/she stated that these price increases, however, should be understood as associated to supply factors.",
        "He/she added that as the normalization of activities progresses, supply chains are foreseen to begin to realign and prices will adjust to levels compatible with those prevailing prior to the pandemic.",
        "Most members mentioned that central banks in advanced economies reiterated their intention to stances.",
        "Some members pointed out that, in its latest policy decision, the Federal Reserve considered that there is still some way to go before achieving its targets.",
        "One member added that the Fed reinforced its expectation of a moderate increase in inflation, with no increases to its reference rate until 2023.",
        "Another member argued that the Federal Reserve has been very emphatic regarding the importance of fully understanding the character and the implications of the recent inflationary pressures.",
        "He/she recalled that, in its latest decision, that institution highlighted the transitory nature of the increase in inflation, explaining that inflation is expected to exceed 2%, and making it clear that such result is due to the low comparison base and to bottlenecks that limit the response of supply given the recovery of spending.",
        "He/she mentioned that the president of the Federal Reserve explicitly recognized that this temporary increase in inflation does not meet the conditions to begin a reduction in the monetary stimulus.",
        "He/she pointed out that it is necessary to remember the highly accommodative nature of the new monetary policy strategy adopted by the Federal Reserve.",
        "He/she noted that, because inflation has remained persistently below 2% in the past, such institution will now allow inflation to remain moderately above 2% for some time.",
        "He/she considered that this implies that the Federal Reserve will not increase its interest rates, nor will it reduce the level of its asset purchases in a mechanical way when inflation increases beyond 2%.",
        "He/she added that the Fed pointed out that labor market conditions are not close to meeting its definition of maximum employment.",
        "Some members mentioned that central banks in some emerging economies have started to reduce their monetary stimulus.",
        "They argued that in those economies the monetary policy stance had been relaxed aggressively, leading to exchange rate or inflationary pressures.",
        "One member pointed out that the currencies of some of these economies have exhibited a significant cumulative depreciation during the year.",
        "He/she added that the rebound in inflation prompted some central banks in emerging economies to conclude their monetary easing cycle and begin increasing their reference rates.",
        "He/she mentioned that the expectation of a tighter monetary policy in economies facing inflationary pressures persists.",
        "Another member considered that such pressures are strictly local and that they should not be extrapolated to economies that have acted in a more cautious and prudent manner, such as Mexico.",
        "He/she added that the majority of central banks in emerging economies still maintain strongly accommodative monetary policy stances and are expected to continue doing so at least for the rest of register negative ex-ante real interest rates.",
        "Most members mentioned that financial markets exhibited a more stable behavior.",
        "They noted that, after having increased significantly due to the expectation of higher inflation in the United States, longer-term interest rates in that country have stabilized.",
        "They pointed out that the main stock markets registered gains, some of them reaching historically high levels.",
        "They added that the US dollar appreciation was contained.",
        "One member noted that this environment is explained by factors such as the consistency in the Federal Reserve's announcements regarding the continuation of the monetary stimulus and the economic recovery.",
        "He/she considered that looking ahead, these factors will continue to support financial markets.",
        "Some members mentioned that, since the last monetary policy decision, financial markets in emerging economies exhibited a more orderly behavior.",
        "These members noted that capital flows to these economies continued.",
        "One member pointed out that flows to fixed-income assets continued and that those to equities continued to be channeled mainly to the Chinese economy.",
        "Another member pointed out that equity markets in emerging economies registered gains, while interest rates on government bonds remained relatively stable, although with some fluctuations.",
        "Most members agreed that one of the risks for financial markets is the evolution of inflation, particularly in the United States.",
        "One member mentioned that global financing conditions could suddenly tighten as a result of an inflationary surprise in that country.",
        "In this regard, another member emphasized the uncertainty about whether inflationary pressures in the United States will be moderate and transitory, or of considerable magnitude and more persistent.",
        "He/she pointed out that the eventual reduction in asset purchases by the Federal Reserve is a risk factor for fixed-income markets.",
        "Meanwhile, one member considered that the lack of confidence in the market regarding the possibility that the Federal Reserve adopts a less accommodative policy, while still manifesting itself in recent days, has begun to decline given the consistency in the actions and the rhetoric of that institution.",
        "Some members added the risk of adjustments in the prices of certain financial assets.",
        "One member added that public and private debts, which have reached record highs, might not be sustainable.",
        "Regarding emerging economies, another member stated that the global environment implies both the benefits of a higher external demand and the risks of tighter and more volatile financial conditions.",
        "He/she specified that the fiscal stimulus in the US economy will support the recovery, which is especially important for economies that are more integrated to that economy and have smaller spending stimulus programs.",
        "Nevertheless, he/she considered that should a greater-than-expected increase in US inflation take place, interest rates would be under pressure at a global level.",
        "He/she pointed out that to the extent that this occurs, emerging economies will face greater difficulties in attracting and retaining capital, possible exchange rate adjustments, and upward pressures on yield curves.",
        "In the same vein, he/she added the challenges associated with the inclusion of China in several global fixed income indices.",
        "He/she detailed that an environment of high uncertainty prevails in financial markets due to the interaction of several unprecedented factors: i) a health-related shock, unrelated to the economic or financial cycles; ii) a highly differentiated fiscal stimulus; iii) the negative impact on global and domestic supply chains; iv) the change in the Federal Reserve's monetary policy strategy, for which financial markets do not have direct precedents to extrapolate possible monetary policy actions, making the adjustment more volatile; and v) a heterogeneous global recovery across countries and sectors, with differences in yield curves, exchange rates, and external accounts.",
        "All members agreed that economic recovery in Mexico has been heterogeneous across sectors and regions.",
        "Most members mentioned that the pace of recovery decelerated during the first quarter of the year, due to higher levels of contagion and reimposed mobility restrictions in early 2021, as well as supply disruptions of certain inputs.",
        "Some members emphasized that economic activity showed a higher growth rate towards the end of the first quarter of the year.",
        "Some members attributed the improvement in different activity indicators following an easing of mobility restrictions to a lower number of contagions and to greater advance in the vaccination process.",
        "One member highlighted that a positive quarterly growth was registered during said period despite the halting of business activity and the aforementioned supply chain disruptions.",
        "Regarding demand, most members agreed that the recovery continues to be driven by the external sector.",
        "One member pointed out that during the first quarter of the year non-automotive manufacturing exports to the United States stood out, given that automotive exports contracted in January and February.",
        "He/she highlighted that forecasts for industrial production in the United States increased as a result of the approved fiscal stimulus, and that therefore external demand is foreseen to continue contributing significantly to Mexico’s recovery.",
        "He/she added that the external accounts reflected the relative strength of exports and the lag in the recovery of imports that led to a large trade surplus, which is estimated to decrease over the following quarters.",
        "consumption has recovered slightly, it remains below pre-pandemic levels.",
        "They highlighted that consumption has been supported by the higher confidence has been improving.",
        "One member pointed out that the recovery was faster in nondurable consumption goods, spurred by remittances, the wage bill and government transfers.",
        "He/she pointed out that, in contrast, both services consumption and consumption of domestic durable goods still show a strong contraction.",
        "Another member considered that latest data on remittances and the consumer confidence index suggests that the process of recovery of private consumption will continue over the next months.",
        "Some members highlighted the improvement, at the margin, of timely indicators related to commercial activity and consumption.",
        "Most members highlighted that investment continues to show lack of dynamism.",
        "One member stated that in February it was 7.42% below the level registered at the beginning of 2020, and that it has been weak for several years.",
        "Another member emphasized that the government has not done enough to offset the sense of uncertainty prevailing in the business sector regarding the respect for the rule of law, and that for this reason a vigorous recovery in investment is not anticipated.",
        "As for supply, all members highlighted the heterogeneous pace of recovery across sectors.",
        "One member underlined that the subsectors that continue showing a contraction of over 5% in their monthly activity with respect to pre-pandemic levels account for around 27.8% of GDP.",
        "He/she stated that in March industrial production accumulated ten months of positive monthly changes.",
        "Some members emphasized the impact of the shortage of semiconductors on the automotive industry.",
        "One member pointed out that this has diminished the performance of the industrial sector and of exports.",
        "Another member mentioned that, after leading the recovery, manufacturing contracted in January and February, although in March it performed better.",
        "He/she added that in March construction was still at levels of monthly activity that were over 8% lower than those recorded in early 2020.",
        "Most members highlighted the weakness in the services sector and the differentiated performance among its subsectors.",
        "Some members pointed out that face- to-face services continue to be significantly affected.",
        "Most members noted that the labor market has been recovering, although it still exhibits deterioration with respect to pre-pandemic levels.",
        "One member mentioned that, despite the fact that the National Survey on Occupation and Employment (ENOE, for its Spanish acronym) of March shows that the labor participation rate has recovered to 58% of the population, after having fallen below 48% during the pandemic, it is still below the levels recorded in early 2020.",
        "Another member pointed out that both formal and informal employment, which between February and April million of them were added during the first quarter of the year.",
        "He/she added that by April, IMSS-insured jobs were at levels 2.6% lower than those registered in February 2020.",
        "Some members noted that the asymmetric recovery across sectors and types of jobs has been unfavorable in terms of gender, affecting women to a greater extent than men.",
        "One member argued that the sectors that expanded the most are related to industry, which has allowed employment among men to recover, while the slowdown in services has made the labor recovery among women more difficult.",
        "He/she detailed that, since educational activities remain in distancelearning format, the unpaid workload for women has increased, which could considerably amplify labor gender inequality.",
        "Most members pointed out that there is still slack in the economy.",
        "Some members pointed out that the underemployment rate is 14%, a figure twice the level normally observed.",
        "One member highlighted that the output gap is estimated to be of around 6%.",
        "Another member underlined that slack conditions in January and February are estimated to have widened slightly, and to have resumed a decreasing trajectory as of March.",
        "He/she added that slack in the labor market remains ample and, over the following months, additional direct and indirect effects will be incorporated as a result of the reform to the Federal Labor Law on the subject of outsourcing.",
        "Some members noted that, considering the economic contraction of 2020, ample slack conditions are foreseen for the economy as a whole, with significant differences across sectors.",
        "One member argued that, due to the pandemic’s impact, measuring economic slack poses significant challenges, given that estimates of potential GDP and the Nonaccelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment that, in view of a considerable economic contraction, potential GDP is probably overestimated, which suggests a less negative output gap.",
        "Similarly, he/she noted that the open unemployment rate could be an inadequate indicator to illustrate a labor imbalance.",
        "Indeed, estimating the natural employment rate using the open unemployment rate has turned it into an irrelevant and dangerously mistaken reference.",
        "With an economy that is extremely weak it would seem that the open unemployment rate lies below the level of the natural unemployment rate, which is counterintuitive after observing the situation of economic activity.",
        "He/she stated that, in order to adequately calibrate the labor market’s pressures onto prices, a metric is needed which corrects for the structural changes experienced by the population that is economically inactive but available for work, as a result of the pandemic.",
        "Most members highlighted that higher growth is foreseen for the year and that growth forecasts for 2021 have been adjusted upwards.",
        "They mentioned that this stems from the fact that the recovery rate is anticipated to accelerate driven by the strength of external demand.",
        "Some members mentioned advances in the vaccination process.",
        "One member noted the gradual reopening of economic activities and another member added that recently the economy has performed better than expected.",
        "Most members agreed that the balance of risks for growth has improved and that it is now more equilibrated.",
        "Among risks to the upside, they mentioned a possible increase in external demand, given the improved outlook for world growth.",
        "One member added the possibility of observing greater revenues from remittances.",
        "He/she added that a greater external demand combined with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) could stimulate investment.",
        "Some members underlined the possibility of greater progress in the vaccination program.",
        "Among risks on the downside, most members highlighted those related to the evolution of the pandemic, along with possible delays in the vaccination campaign.",
        "One member added the volatility in financial markets and the negative impact on input supply chains.",
        "Another member mentioned the risk associated with the next electoral process due to a renewed environment of risk aversion.",
        "All members mentioned that annual headline inflation increased significantly and more than highlighted that this increase mainly resulted from the effect of a low comparison base for energy prices.",
        "Most members added that pressures on commodity prices and cost-related pressures also contributed to the above.",
        "One member highlighted the outsized increase in the prices of some specific products and emphasized that the increase in inflation does not imply a generalized increase in all prices.",
        "Most members pointed out that an increase in inflation had already been anticipated.",
        "One member noted that the level of April had not been recorded since December 2017.",
        "Some members considered that inflation continues to be impacted by pandemicrelated effects.",
        "One member stated that changes in the consumption basket have implied that there are distortions in the measurement of inflation.",
        "Most members mentioned that the component which exerted the most pressure on headline inflation in April was non-core inflation, which registered 12.3%.",
        "One member underlined that this level is the highest since late 2017.",
        "Another member emphasized that it is the second highest on record in the last 20 years.",
        "He/she noted that between January atypically low values, below the mean of the last ten years, and that a reversal had thus been anticipated for some time.",
        "Most members highlighted the arithmetic effect of energy prices.",
        "Some members emphasized a greater-than-estimated increase in these goods’ prices.",
        "One member noted that, between April 2020 and April 2021, gasoline prices rose 35%, mainly due to a low comparison base.",
        "Another member pointed out the disproportionate increase in LP gas prices and in the prices of certain agricultural and livestock product prices.",
        "Most members noted that in April the core component registered 4.13%.",
        "Some members underlined that it exceeded the upper limit of the variability interval.",
        "Regarding its components, most members indicated that merchandise inflation remains the main source of pressure, particularly non-food merchandise inflation.",
        "Some members mentioned that food merchandise inflation decreased, although one member stated that it remained high.",
        "Another member pointed out the economy confronts an acceleration in the prices of non-food merchandise, mainly those sensitive to energy prices and to the exchange rate.",
        "Most members noted that services inflation has increased.",
        "One member highlighted that, although tourism services’ inflation and food related services inflation rose in light of a certain reopening of activities, housing and education services’ inflation continued to decline.",
        "Another member mentioned the pressures on merchandise prices, which were only partially offset by the lower pressures on services prices.",
        "Some members mentioned that super core inflation remains around 3%, suggesting that pressures on prices do not derive from the cyclical position of the economy.",
        "One member added that indicators which exclude extreme price variations show that price increases of a wide range of products are being contained by the economic slack.",
        "He/she noted that the median of core inflation in April was below 3.25% and therefore half of the products that make up this index registered inflation rates below said level.",
        "He/she added that 30% of goods and services in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) registered inflation rates below 2%.",
        "He/she thus considered that inflation is contained and that its recent increases do not imply a generalized increase in prices, but rather they respond to contextual factors or to specific goods.",
        "Another member considered that a measurement problem is being confronted, which leads to a loss of perspective about the inflationary phenomenon and the slack conditions.",
        "The weak response of inflation to economic slack that is observed in the data could be the result of distortions in the estimation of potential output and the output gap.",
        "If the potential output is overestimated, in reality the output gap is less negative than is suggested by the gap measured in the traditional way, and slack conditions are not as ample as they seem.",
        "He/she added that if that were so then the gap, as traditionally measured, and core inflation are not consistent with each other.",
        "He/she warned that this explains, in part, the weak response of prices to the phase of the economic cycle.",
        "Moreover, he/she added that the distortions in the estimation of the NAIRU based on the open unemployment rate lead to the equivocal conclusion that the open unemployment rate lies below the estimate of the natural unemployment rate, which would imply inflationary pressures.",
        "Some members mentioned that the pandemic generated significant adjustments in price formation.",
        "They highlighted the reassignment of household spending, which enabled a change in relative prices in favor of goods and against services.",
        "One member added that the shutdown of the economy led to problems in supply chains and generated additional costs for firms that had to adapt in an environment of greater social distancing.",
        "He/she added the historical fall in energy prices that has resulted in the base effect observed in 2021.",
        "He/she considered that even though these supply shocks continue to affect domestic inflation, they are expected to be transitory.",
        "expectations for 2021 rose and those for the medium and long terms remained stable at levels above the 3% target.",
        "One member noted that this is in line with the transitory nature of the recent increase in inflation.",
        "He/she mentioned several surveys in which inflation expectations for the following 12 months and for the end of 2022 remain at around 3%.",
        "Another member highlighted that expectations for the end of 2021 are above the 3% target and those for 12 months and the end of 2022 remain stable and below the levels observed in other inflationary episodes.",
        "He/she added that during such episodes, short-term expectations had been more susceptible to being affected by inflationary shocks, because, due to their nature, they are highly sensitive to observed data, which does not necessarily imply a de-anchoring of inflation expectations.",
        "One member underlined that inflation expectations for 2022 collected by Banco de México have remained above stated that inflation expectations drawn from market instruments are at levels close to 3%.",
        "However, some members noted that they have increased at the margin.",
        "One member mentioned that, for the 1-10 year average, inflation expectations were at 3.1%.",
        "Another member stated that breakeven inflation premia decreased marginally for the 10- and 30-year nodes, which suggests that the market also estimates that the current pressures are transitory.",
        "All members pointed out that the revised forecasts for headline and core inflation display short-term levels above those published in the Quarterly Report October-December 2020, but converge to the 3% target starting in the second quarter of 2022.",
        "Most members pointed out that inflationary pressures are expected to be transitory.",
        "One member emphasized that the arithmetic effects associated with the fall in energy prices last year, will continue to affect annual inflation rates for some time.",
        "He/she added that, although the most recent annual variations have been above the expected, a turning point in the evolution of inflation is foreseen in April.",
        "Another member stated that a higher non-core inflation is anticipated due to adjustments in the inflation trajectories of livestock and agricultural products as well as energy products.",
        "He/she added that a higher core inflation is also expected due to the increase in merchandise and services prices, which should be partially offset by a greater appreciation of the Mexican peso.",
        "One member noted that core inflation is expected to start decreasing as of the third quarter of the year.",
        "Another member considered that the expected trajectory of this component remains highly uncertain.",
        "Among the upward risks to inflation, most members highlighted the possibility of external inflationary pressures, cost-related pressures or a reallocation of spending, as well as possible episodes of exchange rate depreciation.",
        "One member pointed out that increases in transportation costs and logistics issues in production chains contribute to increase the prices of imported inputs.",
        "persistence of core inflation.",
        "One member pointed out that this has been observed despite the tight monetary policy stance implemented prior to the pandemic and ample slack conditions during the COVID-19 emergency.",
        "Some members pointed out the rise in commodity prices as an additional risk.",
        "One member noted that expectations of an appreciation of the Mexican peso appear to be optimistic and may be reversed due to external and internal factors, which would generate pressures that could further divert the foreseen trajectory of inflation.",
        "Likewise, he/she pointed out that the foreseen trajectory for core inflation remains highly uncertain, given that the impact on the composition of expenditure may persist to the extent that the pandemic continues and mobility restrictions are maintained.",
        "Most members warned about the impact of production, which would exert upward pressure on non-core inflation.",
        "Some members foresee inflationary pressures on services prices as health restrictions are lifted.",
        "One member added that this would lead to the fading of the favorable effect that services inflation has had in offsetting the high levels of merchandise inflation.",
        "Another member added the risk of the deterioration of inflation expectations hindering the accelerated decline in inflation and its convergence to the target in the time frame envisaged.",
        "He/she considered that upward risks will be present in the short and medium terms.",
        "One member expressed his/her view that the delay of said convergence could lead to a de-anchoring of inflation expectations, which are already above the upper limit of the variability interval.",
        "mentioned the effects stemming from the negative output gap.",
        "One member highlighted the risk of greater social distancing measures and the possibility of an exchange rate appreciation.",
        "Another member noted that the risk of exchange rate depreciation has decreased due to the improvement in financial markets.",
        "He/she added that gasoline prices have stabilized in line with the federal government's pricing policy and that, therefore, looking ahead, their contribution to inflation will be more limited.",
        "Most members considered that the balance of risks that might affect the anticipated path for inflation within the forecast horizon is biased to the upside.",
        "One member stated that this bias is clear given the behavior of inflation and its expectations.",
        "He/she added that the risks for noncore inflation are also biased to the upside due to: i) the possibility of supply shocks associated with a lower availability of fuels; ii) negative impact on livestock and agricultural production; and iii) demand-related pressures, driven by the increase in consumption and the reactivation of the US economy.",
        "Another member mentioned that the balance of risks for headline inflation has deteriorated.",
        "One member considered that, on balance, beyond the increase that can be anticipated for the end-of-year figure, inflation risks are relatively stable.",
        "financial markets have exhibited a more stable behavior.",
        "One member considered that this is due to improved expectations for economic growth in Mexico and worldwide.",
        "Another member stated that the Federal Reserve has been categorical in conveying its monetary policy message, contributing to an orderly adjustment of markets.",
        "He/she added that the risks for financial markets observed at the time of the previous monetary policy decision have been dissipating.",
        "The majority of members noted that the Mexican considered that this reflects a greater appetite for risk worldwide and the greater weakness of the US dollar.",
        "He/she highlighted that the Mexican currency performed more favorably than other emerging market currencies.",
        "He/she added that in some economies aggressive monetary easing cycles have put their exchange rates under stress, which required substantial interventions to stabilize their value.",
        "Despite this, he/she noted that some of these currencies have depreciated significantly this year.",
        "He/she stated that, in contrast, the Mexican peso has shown less volatility, a moderate cumulative depreciation, and has not required exchange-rate interventions.",
        "He/she considered that this should be attributed to a responsible macroeconomic framework and a prudent approach to monetary policy.",
        "However, he/she pointed out that the positive behavior of the Mexican peso could be affected by episodes of volatility stemming from the dynamics of the US long-term bond market or the upcoming electoral process in Mexico.",
        "Most members mentioned that foreign investors' holdings of government bonds continued to decline.",
        "Some members noted that foreign investors have shown preference for Asian economies’ assets.",
        "One member pointed out that, over the past eighteenth months, China has absorbed two-thirds of the fixed-income flows to emerging economies.",
        "He/she considered that while this adjustment associated with China’s inclusion in global fixedincome indices may be transitory, while weights in investment portfolios are recalibrated, the lack of participation of foreign investors in Mexico’s primary auctions for government securities continues to stand out.",
        "Another member noted that nominal government bond yields increased, in a context of deteriorated trading conditions and limited interest for this type of assets by foreign and local investors, who have shown caution given the external and domestic conditions.",
        "In this regard, he/she highlighted the uncertainty about the monetary policy actions that the Federal Reserve may take and, at the margin, a decrease in the liability management operations by the Ministry of Finance (SHCP).",
        "One member mentioned that a steepening of the yield curve has been observed, given expectations of higher inflation in the United States.",
        "He/she argued that this has been reflected in lower risk appetite and in capital outflows.",
        "He/she noted that so far these outflows have occurred under conditions that have allowed for an orderly adjustment of rates and the exchange rate.",
        "He/she added that the surplus observed in the balance of payments’ current account has served to accommodate the outflows, while the banking sector has absorbed the reduction in foreigners' holdings due to the search for investment options to replace the lower credit placement.",
        "He/she considered that this situation may change in view of the expected reversal of the current account surplus and the limits of banks' absorption capacity, especially in view of an eventual improvement in credit placement.",
        "Another member stated that the equity market continued to show capital inflows and that, in view of the greater stability of financial markets, the sovereign risk premium decreased.",
        "He/she pointed out that the yield curve in Mexico exhibited a mixed behavior, with a decrease in the short end and increases in the medium and long ends.",
        "One member added that the interest rate on 10-year bonds registered fluctuations, reaching levels below 6.5%.",
        "Regarding the stock market, most members noted that the Mexican IPC index registered gains.",
        "One member stated that this was due to a positive balance in the corporate reporting season.",
        "The majority of members noted that financing to the private sector continues to decline and that credit standards have worsened.",
        "Some members stated that credit to firms continues to decrease and expressed concern regarding this situation.",
        "One member mentioned that this has been observed for four consecutive quarters.",
        "He/she added that, in terms of its annual variation, consumer credit has fallen in practically all of its segments.",
        "Some members stated that only housing credit showed positive growth.",
        "One member pointed out that in March, credit to Small and Medium-sized Enterprises He/she added that according to Banco de México’s Survey on General Conditions and Standards in the Banking Credit Market (EnBan, for its Spanish acronym), it has become more difficult to obtain credit from commercial banks.",
        "Another member noted that the intermediation margins of interest rates to firms remain at higher levels than prior to the pandemic.",
        "One member mentioned that delinquency rates remain at relatively low levels.",
        "He/she stated that, in terms of resource use, public sector financing dominates, while credit to the private sector remains deteriorated, despite the decline in interest rates.",
        "Some members pointed out that firms' and households' demand for liquidity persists.",
        "One member considered that this is due to precautionary reasons.",
        "Another member added that domestic sources continued to expand, while external sources continue showing lack of dynamism.",
        "All members agreed to maintain the target for the overnight interbank interest rate at 4.00%.",
        "This, considering the inflation forecasts, the risks they are subject to, as well as the need to consolidate a downward trajectory for headline and core inflation to the 3% target.",
        "They highlighted that the recent shocks that have affected the evolution of inflation pose challenges for the implementation of monetary policy, so that the adjustment in relative prices takes place in an orderly manner, and so that an impact on the members emphasized that in a highly uncertain environment such as the current one, a prudent approach is required.",
        "Finally, they reiterated that, looking ahead, monetary policy implementation will depend on the evolution of the factors that have an incidence on inflation, on its foreseen trajectories within the forecast horizon, and on One member highlighted the complex environment for monetary policy.",
        "He/she pointed out that the effects of supply, demand and financial shocks associated with the pandemic are still being confronted.",
        "In this context, he/she considered that in small open emerging economies, which need to supplement their domestic savings with external sources of financing, it is even more important to maintain a solid macroeconomic environment that attracts capital and fosters an orderly adjustment in the economy.",
        "In this regard, he/she mentioned that monetary policy should contribute to such adjustment by maintaining inflation low and around its target, containing increases in risk premia and in mediumand long-term interest rates, as well as the exchange rate adjustment.",
        "He/she pointed out that the recent shocks that have affected inflation imply greater challenges for monetary policy implementation, in order to ensure that the adjustment of relative prices is orderly and to avoid affecting the price formation process and inflation expectations.",
        "For this reason, it is necessary for Banco de México to maintain a prudent monetary policy stance that favors a downward trajectory for headline and core inflation towards the 3% target.",
        "Another member stated that, despite the significant progress in counteracting the pandemic and its effects on the economy, important risks and challenges prevail.",
        "He/she noted that the supply shocks that have occurred are expected to be transitory.",
        "Consequently, he/she emphasized that it is important to reflect on monetary policy’s response capacity to this type of events, especially when inflationary pressures do not seem to arise from aggregate demand.",
        "In this context, he/she mentioned that the central bank needs to ensure that inflation expectations remain anchored so that these shocks do not lead to second-round effects.",
        "In this regard, he/she pointed out that although very shortterm inflation expectations have deteriorated, medium- and long-term expectations remain stable, which indicates that, as a whole, they are anchored.",
        "Finally, he/she emphasized the importance of paying special attention to the evolution of commodity and services prices, with the aim of guaranteeing the convergence of inflation to its goal.",
        "One member stated that for this monetary policy decision, in addition to the economic and financial information available, there are other factors that gain relevance, such as the high sensitivity of Mexican assets to financial conditions in the United States, the decline of government bond holdings by the foreign sector, which has affected local market conditions, and a more intense competition for investor’s resources, who have revealed a growing interest in Asian markets.",
        "He/she added that domestic factors could compromise the convergence of inflation towards the target within the horizon in which monetary policy operates.",
        "In this regard, he/she referred to the risks for headline and non-core inflation.",
        "He/she argued that the observed tightening in financial conditions, despite the reduction in the reference rate and weak fiscal support, reduces the room for maneuver for monetary policy.",
        "He/she stated that the monetary policy statement should communicate clearly that with this decision there will be space to update the projections based on available information and take the necessary actions to achieve a downward, sustained and convergent inflation trajectory.",
        "This is due to the risk that since the last monetary policy decision, inflation expectations could be contaminated, which could affect the effectiveness of monetary policy and undermine the credibility of the commitment to price stability.",
        "He/she noted that the prudent monetary policy approach that has been followed, allows the Mexican economy to be in a better position to face the challenges of the economic recovery.",
        "Another member noted that the current economic cycle is not a traditional one, with unusual effects for decision making.",
        "He/she mentioned that several unobservable indicators, such as the output gap, the NAIRU rate, and the neutral real rate are biased and present challenges for their adequate interpretation.",
        "He/she stated that the real neutral rate was estimated to be around 2.6%, but because of the pandemic, it probably decreased, and thus the space for lowering the reference rate would be larger than currently considered.",
        "However, he/she added that there is uncertainty regarding this indicator and that it is necessary to wait for sufficient information in order to be able to make reliable estimates and act with certainty.",
        "He/she pointed out that there is an inconsistency in the level of the real interest rate, since if it is very high, it should, by inhibiting economic activity, have a beneficial effect on inflation.",
        "However, if the negative output gap is less wide than estimated, a higher real rate would be needed to lower core inflation.",
        "He/she mentioned that this is somewhat contradictory considering Mexico’s current situation.",
        "For this reason, it is necessary to be more analytic and careful of the current circumstances and of its implications for monetary policy.",
        "Given all of the above, he/she pointed out that a pause is necessary to unravel the distortions in the economic information and to act with greater certainty.",
        "He/she argued that given the passivity of fiscal support in the face of the severe economic recession, monetary support is more than necessary.",

        "Some members added that the prices of services also decreased.",
        "One member considered that part of the success of \"El Buen Fin\" in managing to sustain a decline in prices for a long period has its origin in the weakness of aggregate demand, whose effect on prices materialized through this program.",

        "On the one hand, the weakness of demand could lead to a more persistent decline in prices.",

        "He/she stated that these adjustments might reflect the fact that towards the end of the year some supplyrelated pressures had been accumulated due to the effects of the pandemic, which had not been offset by the weakness of demand.",
        "He/she noted that this could be associated with the recomposition of household spending, which has intensified as a result of the pandemic, with higher spending on merchandise and lower spending on services.",
        "He/she argued that this is confirmed by the fact that annual merchandise inflation is much higher than that of services.",
        "As for non-core inflation, some members mentioned that it fell, mainly due to the fall in the annual rates of change of fruits and vegetable and gasoline prices.",

        "Another member considered that the behavior of core inflation is not consistent with what is usually observed during the bottom stage of the business cycle, when all expenditure items are typically affected.",
        "He/she noted that, due to the nature of the pandemic and the social distancing measures, households have concentrated their expenditure mostly on merchandise and have significantly reduced their spending on services, which brings about additional uncertainty on the inflationary process.",

        "Some members considered that headline inflation would end the year at levels below 3.5%.",
        "Some members highlighted that inflation forecasts indicate that the target would be attained in 2022.",
        "One member stated that the evolution of inflation in the following months will continue to be influenced by the impact of the pandemic on supply and demand, as well as by the behavior of the peso exchange rate, among other factors.",
        "Another member pointed out that a rise in inflation is anticipated mainly associated with a comparison base effect that would prevail until April to the 3% target during the second half of 2021.",
        "One member argued that fundamental inflation determinants, such as the exchange rate appreciation, the weakness of demand and low energy prices, exhibit a behavior that tends to favor price stability.",
        "He/she mentioned that the recent international events have dissipated factors of uncertainty and improved the balance of risks around the inflation forecast.",
        "As for upward risks to inflation, most members highlighted possible episodes of exchange rate considering the historical trend of the exchange rate, there is a risk of a further depreciation of the peso, which would imply delaying the convergence of inflation to the target.",
        "Another member emphasized that a relatively stable evolution of the peso exchange rate, at levels similar to the current one, may be unfeasible given that the peso exchange rate may be affected by several factors, including a deterioration of the health situation, the election process next year, the challenges for public finances, the evolution of the sovereign rating, the high liquidity of the peso in international financial markets under a volatile environment, and the recent draft proposal of reforms to Banco de México’s Law.",
        "Some members added the risk posed by wage increases.",
        "One member argued that the adjustment to the minimum wage may be of such a magnitude as to complicate the convergence of inflation to the target during the time frame in which monetary policy operates.",
        "Another member added the risk of aggressive wage increases in 2021 possibly contributing to a deterioration of inflation expectations.",
        "He/she also noted the persistence of core inflation, despite the slack conditions.",
        "One member highlighted the risk of core inflation pressures stemming from the recomposition of spending towards merchandise, as well as several cost-related pressures on firms.",
        "Another member considered that, although core inflation still remains at relatively high levels, this should not be overestimated as this indicator is still reflecting the price dynamics of the most severe phase of the pandemic, when food and other merchandise prices increased significantly.",
        "He/she noted that the performance of this indicator can be expected to be more favorable once these price increases are undone, which would contribute to reduce headline and core inflation levels.",
        "As for downward risks to inflation, some members highlighted an exchange rate appreciation and a greater than expected effect of the negative output gap.",
        "One member added greater social distancing measures or persistence in the decline in prices due to “El Buen Fin”, as well as lower inflationary pressures worldwide.",
        "Another member stated that recent international events have improved the balance of risks for inflation, as factors of uncertainty about the behavior of the exchange rate have dissipated.",
        "Some members considered that the balance of risks around the projected trajectory of inflation remains uncertain.",
        "One of them noted that this is associated with the unprecedented shocks that have affected the economy this year and the opposing effects they have had on inflation.",
        "Another member pointed out that, although the current scenario is subject to both downward and upward risks, the balance is biased to the upside.",
        "Most members noted that financial markets showed a favorable behavior partly due to greater risk appetite in international markets.",
        "One member highlighted the soundness of Mexico's macroeconomic fundamentals.",
        "The majority of members mentioned that the stock market registered gains and noted that the Mexican peso appreciated.",
        "One member added that the peso has significantly reversed the depreciation it presented at the beginning of the pandemic.",
        "Another member pointed out that, although trading conditions have improved, they have still not returned to those observed prior to the pandemic.",
        "He/she added that, recently episodes of peso volatility, associated with the discussion regarding the reform to Banco de México’s Law, were observed.",

        "Some members pointed out that outflows in government securities have slowed and that foreign investor inflows have already been registered.",

        "Some members noted that the state of public finances is a risk factor.",
        "One member mentioned that the shortfall in budget revenues continued to widen due to lower tax and oil revenues.",
        "He/she added that the use of resources from the Budget Revenue Stabilization Fund (FEIP, for its acronym in Spanish) and the repurchase operation carried out by Pemex in November, reported as revenues, have allowed the fiscal balance to register a greater surplus than programmed.",
        "However, he/she argued that this does not reflect the risks of public finances adequately.",
        "He/she added that the resources of the FEIP will have been spent in 2021, which will exert more pressure on programmable spending.",
        "He/she noted that the fiscal balance could deteriorate in the event of increased spending pressures associated with the continuation of the pandemic and the materialization of a downgrade of sovereign credit ratings.",
        "Another member noted that some rating agencies affirmed the investment grade of the sovereign debt without changing its outlook, which reduces the possibility of the country losing its credit rating in the short term.",
        "He/she noted that the expected debt-to-GDP ratio for Mexico in the following years is below that of emerging countries with better credit ratings, and that a lower debt service in the future may set Mexico apart from other countries and increase the attractiveness of domestic assets.",
        "He/she added that fiscal discipline and responsibility are important in preserving macroeconomic fundamentals.",
        "Some members expressed concerns about Pemex's financial situation.",
        "They mentioned that the possibility of this company requiring additional support may affect public finances.",
        "One member pointed out that the fall in its sales has led to an increase in its indebtedness with suppliers and to a contraction in investment.",
        "He/she added that Pemex accumulates significant under-spending in investment, which could affect future crude oil production in a context where it has registered figures below those expected.",
        "He/she stated that the cost of hedging against Pemex’s default risk is higher than that for other oil companies with similar credit ratings, which reflects markets’ perception about the risks stemming from the state-owned company’s financial situation.",
        "Most members mentioned that the evolution of financing to firms and consumers remains a cause of concern.",
        "Some members highlighted the reduction in credit to consumers and small- and medium-sized firms.",
        "One member noted that consumer credit via credit cards registered a real annual contraction of 12.5% in October, while credit to small- and medium-sized firms showed an annual fall of 6.3% in the same month, although its most recent monthly variation was slightly positive after having declined for seven consecutive months.",
        "Another member pointed out that financing to firms and consumers continued to fall for the fifth consecutive month.",
        "Some members noted that the contraction of credit in Mexico contrasts with that observed in other economies, with one member highlighting the cases of both advanced and emerging economies.",
        "Another member attributed this situation to the implementation of fiscal stimuli programs in several countries, while one member emphasized the lack of government guarantees for bank credit.",
        "Another member stated that the evolution of credit is determined by supply and demand factors.",
        "He/she pointed out that the level of commercial banks’ deposits tends to boost the supply of credit, while business confidence influences demand.",
        "He/she added that, while it cannot be ruled out that demand factors play a part in the current situation, evidence from Banco de México’s Survey on General Conditions and Standards in the Banking Credit Market (EnBan, for its acronym in Spanish) indicates that credit lines offered by commercial banks’ have decreased and, thus, supply factors contributing to the contraction of credit cannot be minimized.",
        "One member considered that public policies that incentivize the supply and demand of credit should be strengthened.",
        "He/she added that development banks must intensify their efforts, not only by expanding the credit they offer, but also by providing guarantees to debtors.",
        "He/she noted that these measures should aim at promoting investment and consumption, particularly of durable goods.",

        "Regarding financial stability, another member mentioned that, although the banking system maintains high capital levels, the continuation of the health emergency and the slow economic recovery may deteriorate its capitalization.",
        "He/she added that it is therefore important to monitor all warning signs, particularly regarding the deterioration of the credit portfolio.",
        "In this regard, he/she noted that the pastdue portfolio increased in October, particularly in the credit card segment, due to the expiration in September of the special accounting criteria.",
        "Some members highlighted that the current environment is not conducive to private investment.",
        "One member added that the outlook of uncertainty and economic expectations are conditions that do not incentivize investment.",
        "Another member mentioned the lack of fiscal support.",
        "One member argued that, in face of a complex environment, a sound and sustainable macroeconomic stance that promotes confidence and contributes to an orderly adjustment of financial markets and of the economy overall is essential.",
        "He/she emphasized the importance of maintaining sustainable public finances, a low and stable inflation, and a sound and well-capitalized financial system.",
        "As to the recent initiative to amend Banco de México Law regarding the acquisition of foreign currency cash, most members agreed that it is positive that Congress, and in particular the Chamber of Deputies, decided to open a space for reflection regarding the proposal, with the objective of contributing to the process of analysis to find the best options for the solution of the issues and challenges raised.",
        "They highlighted that it is fundamental that the solution reached preserves Banco de México’s autonomy and that it does not affect its operation.",
        "They pointed out that the risk that the Central Bank's balance sheet may become contaminated with resources of illicit origin must be avoided, as it would jeopardize the availability of international reserves and access to external macroeconomic and financial instability.",
        "One member mentioned that Banco de México has pointed out that it agrees with the benefits pursued by this proposal in regards to improving the circulation of foreign currency that enters our country as a result of legal activities.",
        "However, he/she underlined that efforts in this direction must preserve the constitutional autonomy granted to Banco de México and avoid jeopardizing its operation and the availability of international reserves.",
        "He/she argued that if the actions adopted in this regard address the above-mentioned risks, this would avoid introducing a considerable and unnecessary factor of uncertainty in Banco de México’s functions and in the financial system’s operations.",
        "Another member mentioned the comments by a rating agency stating that in case the proposal were approved in its actual terms, it would affect the Central Bank’s autonomy along with the macroeconomic stability of the country.",
        "He/she added that this constitutes a risk for the Central Bank and for the national financial system.",
        "Considering the impact on inflation, economic activity and financial markets, the inflation outlook and the uncertainty surrounding it, as well as the convenience of consolidating a downward trajectory of headline and core inflation towards the 3% target, most members agreed to maintain the target for the overnight interbank interest rate at 4.25%.",
        "Two members voted for lowering the target to 4.00%.",
        "Most members agreed that the decision to leave the policy rate unchanged constitutes a pause which provides the necessary room to confirm the convergence of the inflation trajectory to its One member mentioned that, considering the pandemic-related supply, demand and financial shocks, monetary policy must contribute to maintain inflation at low levels and around its target, foster an orderly functioning of financial markets, financial system stability, and contribute to a sustained economic recovery.",
        "He/she noted that, to achieve these goals it is important that the yield curve follows an orderly behavior, given that the aggregate demand components respond to the different segments of the curve.",
        "He/she argued that an orderly and sustainable downward adjustment in this curve has benefits, especially considering the pandemicrelated impacts, and contributes to a better response of aggregate demand and the financial system.",
        "He/she considered that, especially in emerging economies, medium- and long-term interest rates include various risk premia and that inflation must remain low and stable to lower inflationary risk premia throughout the yield curve.",
        "He/she stressed that for small open emerging economies, which need to complement their domestic savings with external sources of financing, it is important to maintain a stable macroeconomic environment, both to attract and to retain capital, and to have the financial conditions required for an orderly adjustment of the economy.",
        "In this regard, he/she highlighted that so far this year short- and long-term interest rates in Mexico have adjusted downwards significantly as compared to other emerging economies, which, despite having lower short-term interest rates, have been subject to pressures on long-term ones.",
        "He/she added that pandemic-related factors have made it more difficult to maintain low and stable risk premia in emerging economies, given that a deep economic contraction, lower public revenue, growing spending and capital outflow pressures were observed simultaneously.",
        "He/she pointed out that it is necessary to avoid taking measures that might jeopardize macroeconomic stability and soundness.",
        "In this context, he/she referred to the proposal seeking to modify Banco de México’s Law which has been recently approved by the Mexican Senate.",
        "Finally, he/she considered that leaving the policy rate unchanged would allow to better identify the challenges and trade-offs faced by monetary policy, in an environment in which headline and core inflation have been pressured by opposing factors and have exhibited considerable volatility in their most recent figures, despite the sharp economic weakness.",
        "In addition, this room for maneuver would provide greater clarity over other significant risk factors that are affecting the Mexican economy.",
        "Another member expressed that further extending the pause in the monetary easing cycle would allow to assess, based on incoming information, monetary policy’s margin of maneuver and reinforce the credibility of the Central Bank’s commitment to its primary mandate.",
        "He/she argued that extending the pause would allow to confirm if inflation, mainly its core component, has started a downward trend or whether November’s data were atypical.",
        "He/she stated that the balance of risks for inflation remains uncertain and recalled that core inflation’s resistance to decline has been observed for a long period, and that thus it is prudent to not anticipate conclusions, which could be counterproductive.",
        "He/she added that high risks that could generate volatility persist.",
        "He/she underlined that domestic risks have gained more relevance and could exert pressure on the exchange rate, which would further stress the monetary policy stance.",
        "In particular, regarding the proposal to amend Banco de México’s Law, he/she mentioned that allowing more time to analyze the challenges associated with inflows of foreign currency cash to the country was a positive decision.",
        "He/she pointed out that, although there are risks associated with this legislative process, it is key to address said challenges without jeopardizing the Central Bank’s autonomy, which has been a cornerstone of Mexico’s macroeconomic stability and the main strength behind the country’s credit profile.",
        "In addition, he/she emphasized that the weakening of public finances, Pemex’s fragile situation, and the deterioration of the business environment worsen the concerns regarding country risk, and that the electoral process in 2021 could also lead to more volatility.",
        "For this reason, he/she stated that insofar as the exchange rate risk persists, a prudent monetary policy approach as the one followed should be maintained, in order to assess if there is a margin for a greater stimulus.",
        "Finally, he/she considered that the monetary policy statement should clearly communicate that the current monetary policy decision seeks to guarantee the downward trend of inflation to its target in the time frame in which monetary policy operates, and that a prudent and responsible monetary policy implementation is the best way to confirm the Central Bank’s commitment to price stability.",
        "One member pointed out that the decision in November to make a pause in monetary policy implementation had the objective of obtaining greater clarity regarding the future trajectory of inflation.",
        "He/she considered that the time elapsed has not been sufficient to achieve the above.",
        "First, he/she pointed out that there are no signs of a sustained reduction of inflationary pressures.",
        "Second, he/she added that upwards risks to inflation have intensified and that the most important one stems from the proposed reform to Banco de México’s Law.",
        "He/she pointed out that recent experience shows its potential repercussions on the exchange rate, and that statistical exercises indicate that even moderate exchange rate depreciations can make inflation deviate from its target considerably.",
        "He/she stated that although the recent decision to provide a space for dialogue is welcome, the risks associated with the proposal would continue insofar as this initiative is not defined.",
        "In this context, he/she considered that a message of monetary policy easing would contradict the Central Bank’s reasoning on the issue and, thus, would be detrimental for the institution.",
        "To the above he/she added the possible impact of an adjustment in the minimum wage on prices.",
        "Third, he/she underlined the risk of new volatility episodes in global financial markets, as well as risks derived from idiosyncratic factors, among which he/she highlighted the challenges to public finances, due in part to the possible need to provide additional support to Pemex, in view of the continuous deterioration of its financial situation.",
        "Fourth, he/she mentioned that the date of inflation’s convergence to the target continues to be postponed, and that both analysts’ inflation expectations and their incompatibility with the adjustments in the reference rate anticipated by many of them highlight the credibility challenges faced by the Central Bank.",
        "Regarding the future trajectory of the reference rate, he/she argued that the prevailing uncertainty does not allow for the provision of accurate forward guidance.",
        "He/she warned that messages of such nature, or others that give the impression that monetary policy is focused on goals different from inflation, such as stimulating growth, would generate confusion in the markets and would accentuate the credibility challenges.",
        "In this regard, he/she underlined the importance of pointing out that monetary policy will be implemented in a prudent manner, with pragmatism and flexibility, based on incoming information in each meeting, with the goal of attaining the convergence of inflation to its target within the period of monetary policy influence.",
        "Another member pointed out that the recent decline in inflation, the favorable evolution of its determinants and the improvement in the balance of risks provide additional room to continue with the monetary easing cycle.",
        "He/she claimed that the need for a greater easing is attributed to a number of factors.",
        "First, credit to households and firms continues contracting.",
        "An additional monetary easing would allow businesses to reduce financing costs and to improve credit granting conditions, which have recently deteriorated.",
        "He/she stated that, despite the low level of development of the financial system, when credit fluctuations are very pronounced, such as in the current juncture, their impact on aggregate activity is significant despite the fact that only a fraction of the economy operates with bank credit.",
        "Second, he/she mentioned that the ex-ante real interest rate in Mexico is still high as compared to other emerging economies.",
        "He/she pointed out that in many countries this rate has become negative, while in Mexico it remains positive.",
        "He/she added that although some countries which have lowered their policy rates more than Mexico, as is the case of Brazil and South Africa, show high long-term rates, this derives from the fact that their sovereign risk is higher than Mexico’s.",
        "Other countries with lower sovereign risk, such as Chile, Peru and, to a lesser extent, Colombia, have managed to cut their short-term interest rates, while maintaining long-term rates at low levels.",
        "He/she noted that the current level of sovereign risk in Mexico provides an opportunity to continue easing monetary policy and to affect the entire yield curve.",
        "Third, he/she mentioned that the macroeconomic outlook in Mexico is characterized by the typical symptoms of economies conducting a very tight monetary policy.",
        "As the first symptom, he/she underlined the poor performance of demand components that are more sensitive to interest rates, such as consumption with credit cards and investment.",
        "As an additional symptom, he/she mentioned the contrast between the dynamism of the external sector, which does not directly respond to the domestic interest rate, and the less dynamic performance of the domestic economy, which does depend on said rate.",
        "He/she considered that the current account surplus is also associated with a tight monetary policy, which encourages saving and discourages investment.",
        "He/she warned that, maintaining the real interest rate high, in a context of weak aggregate demand, incurs the risk of falling into a long and deep recession, and that it can even affect potential growth.",
        "Finally, he/she considered that the cycle of reductions cannot end and that it is urgent to restart it once there are opportunities, as in the case of the current juncture, that allow the provision of support to the economy without jeopardizing the Central Bank’s primary objective of price stability.",
        "One member considered that since the last policy decision inflation has performed favorably, the Mexican peso has appreciated and sovereign risk, measured with Credit Default Swaps (CDS), has decreased to pre-pandemic levels.",
        "He/she mentioned that meanwhile, economic activity continues exhibiting a clear bias to the downside, to such a degree that a historic surplus of 6.7% of GDP was recorded in the current account in the third quarter.",
        "He/she cautioned that the vaccine against COVID-19 will not prevent the scenario of a weak recovery in the short term.",
        "He/she added that, in view of fiscal austerity, monetary policy is the only countercyclical instrument.",
        "He/she emphasized that, based on the monetary policy stance, there is still room to adopt a more expansionary effort, given that the neutral rate is lower considering the sharp fall of economic activity.",
        "He/she added that, if the impacts that limit investment are not addressed, irreversible structural damage will be done to future generations.",
        "Given the expectation of a fragile, difficult and prolonged economic recovery, it is necessary to adopt, as practically in the rest of the world, a highly accommodative stance, and to point out that it will remain so for a long period.",
        "As a consequence, he/she stated that the Central Bank must continue with the cycle of lowering the reference rate, and with the complementary measures that have accompanied said cycle.",
        "He/she mentioned that given the described outlook and considering the lag with which monetary policy operates, it is imperative to lower the reference rate.",
        "He/she added that, during the 2009 financial crisis, real interest rates remained very low, and even negative, which made the monetary stimulus compatible with a relative price stability.",
        "He/she noted that a lower real interest rate than that adopted at that time is necessary, given that the impact of the ongoing crisis on economic activity is much greater and the recovery is anticipated to be slower.",
        "He/she stated that temporary deviations of inflation, when following a foreseen trajectory, should not lead to an overreaction, given that upward pandemic-related distortions in inflation would need to dissipate over the following months.",
        "He/she emphasized that the level of interest rates should strengthen financing, without compromising financial stability.",
        "He/she noted that a low level of interest rates reduces the risk of default for variable-rate loans, which represent a significant fraction of credit granted to firms and improves renegotiation conditions of debtors.",
        "Likewise, it increases asset valuation, improving the balance sheet of financial institutions and businesses’ guarantees to obtain loans.",
        "He/she underlined that one of the messages of the past Financial Stability Report is that a recovery of economic activity and employment contributes to reduce the rate of default on credits, and that for this reason, monetary stimulus to the economy is currently compatible with financial stability.",
        "He/she indicated that a pause in the monetary easing cycle, when there is room to extend it, self-limits the monetary stimulus needed for the economic recovery.",
        "Consequently, it is necessary to continue lowering interest rates to strengthen the signal of the Central Bank’s commitment.",
        "Considering the lag with which monetary policy operates, it is not appropriate to have expectations that the easing will stop for some time, but, on the contrary, that it will continue and will be maintained in the medium term until the economy shows a sustained improvement.",
        "In this way, households and businesses can mitigate the current uncertainty with the prevalence of lower costs of financing.",
        "He/she concluded that the final stage of the downward cycle depends on the moment when economic activity begins to significantly respond to the monetary stimulus.",
        "Similarly, the pace of the monetary easing cycle will have to consider the evolution of the risks to the inflationary outlook.",
        "He/she considered that currently it is possible to continue with the easing cycle, given that inflation is estimated to converge to its target and that multiple risks, both domestic and external, have been thoroughly assessed so as to be addressed efficiently.",
        "He/she stated that, at the present moment this opportunity should be taken to continue with a monetary stimulus consistent with price stability, given that any imbalance in the future could limit Banco de México’s room for maneuver.",
        "The risks for inflation, economic activity and financial markets pose major challenges for monetary policy and for the economy in general.",
        "Considering the mentioned forecasts for inflation, the uncertainty that surrounds them, as well as the convenience of consolidating a downward path for headline and core inflation towards the 3% target, with the presence of all its members, Banco de México’s Governing Board decided by majority to maintain the target for the overnight interbank interest rate at 4.25%.",
        "Two members voted for lowering the rate to 4.00%.",
        "This pause provides the necessary room to confirm that the trajectory of inflation converges to the target.",
        "Looking ahead, monetary policy implementation will depend on the evolution of the factors that have an incidence on headline and core inflation, on their foreseen trajectories within the forecast horizon, and on their expectations.",
        "The Governing Board will take the necessary actions on the basis of incoming information in order for the policy rate to be consistent with the orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to Banco de México’s target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates.",
        "In addition, it is imperative to safeguard the institutional framework, strengthen the macroeconomic fundamentals and adopt the necessary actions on both monetary and fiscal policy fronts, to enable a better adjustment of domestic financial markets and of the economy as a whole.",
        "Alejandro Díaz de León-Carrillo, Irene EspinosaCantellano and Javier Eduardo Guzmán-Calafell voted in favor of maintaining the target for the overnight interbank interest rate at 4.25%.",
        "Gerardo Esquivel-Hernández and Jonathan Ernest Heath-Constable voted in favor of lowering the target for the overnight interbank interest rate to 4.00%.",
        "In November, annual inflation fell by 76 basis points in comparison with October (from 4.09 to 3.33%).",
        "Although this might be partially due to transitory factors, private sector forecasters anticipate annual inflation will end 2020 at 3.4%, an expectation that is certainly more favorable than that at the time of the previous monetary decision (3.95%).",
        "Looking ahead, inflation expectations remain stable, while the Central Bank’s forecasts estimate inflation will near the target starting in the third quarter of 2021.",
        "Although core inflation remains relatively high, this is due to factors associated with the first stage of the lockdown, which are expected to fade by the second half of 2021.",
        "Considering the amount of slack in the economy, the high appreciation of the peso, the decline in country-risk perception, and forecasts on energy prices, no inflationary pressures are foreseen in the short term.",
        "For all of the above, and given that economic reactivation is expected to take place at a relatively slow pace, and that both consumption and domestic investment remain weak, I believe that it would have been more prudent on this occasion to resume the easing cycle and lower the interest rate target by 25 basis points.",
        "My vote for a 25 basis-point reduction is a reiteration of my voting and viewpoint in the past monetary policy decision.",
        "The fundamental reason for my vote is that we face a fragile, difficult and prolonged recovery after a sharp fall in economic activity and its resultant negative impact on the labor market.",
        "In the last month, inflation has fallen considerably, the peso has significantly appreciated, and risk perception is close to levels observed prior to the onset of the pandemic.",
        "In addition, the inflation rate for the end of the year is anticipated to be very close to the Central Bank’s point target, with it being imminent that many states will go back into lockdown due to an increase in the pandemic’s levels of contagion.",
        "For this reason, I believe it is erroneous to continue with this pause, and to miss this window of opportunity to implement a more accommodative monetary policy, consistent with the economic crisis that we face and with the room to maneuver provided by the inflation outlook.",
        "To think that in this favorable context we need to pause to have more clarity on the risk factors does not adequately take into consideration the magnitude of the current crisis"

        "All members mentioned that in early 2020 annual headline inflation increased, although some of them highlighted that at the end of 2019 it stood below 3%.",
        "Most members underlined that the recent increase was mainly associated with the rise in the non-core component.",
        "One member pointed out that the later was due, among other factors, to comparison base effects and to pressures on certain agricultural product prices.",
        "Another member highlighted that the monthly inflation rates of December and January were lower than the average of previous years and lower than those anticipated by the market.",
        "Most members stated that core inflation was affected by the increase in the prices subject to the special tax on production and services (IEPS, for its acronym in Spanish) and that it continues to show resistance to decline.",
        "The majority considered that its behavior is also due to the evolution of wages.",
        "Some members pointed out that data confirms that the subindexes that are more labor intensive and more related to wages, have had the highest increases.",

        "Some members mentioned that, in the absence of pressures stemming from demand, from the peso exchange rate, or from indirect effects from the non-core component, it can be argued that one of the main factors explaining the behavior of core inflation is the evolution of wages.",
        "One member stated that certain inertia in price setting may be added to the above.",
        "Another member highlighted that the prices of food merchandises and of their related services are the ones with the highest increases.",

        "Some members stated that the foreseen path still considers that inflation will converge to the target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates, although some members noted that a temporary rebound is expected.",
        "One member explained that this is due to a comparison base effect and that such increase is expected to reverse considerably in April.",
        "Another member noted that in the following quarters the level of core inflation will largely depend on the interaction between, on the one hand, the greater economic slack and the lower prices of energy goods and, on the other, the effects of the minimum wage increase, which may generate cost pressures that affect employment and prices.",
        "He/she stated that, although the final result is difficult to anticipate since it is unusual for the economy to face labor cost pressures during the lower part of the business cycle, a slight upward revision in core inflation is expected.",

        "He/she argued that such increases will possibly continue in 2020 and that therefore they should not be considered as a transitory shock but rather as one that will be present in the medium term.",
        "He/she stated that it is not clear if wage increases may greatly affect inflation, however, it cannot be concluded either that they will have no impact at all.",
        "The same member noted that empirical evidence on this regard should be considered.",
        "Most members added as upside risks a possible exchange rate adjustment, as well as greater-than-expected increases in agricultural and livestock prices.",

        "Regarding Pemex’s situation, one member pointed out that, although a slight rebound in oil production has been observed, the target for 2020 appears optimistic given that investment is lagging behind.",
        "He/she noted that the fulfillment of the approved balance for 2019 was not the result of a structural improvement, but rather of the increase in supplier financing, of lower oil derivatives imports, and of a fall in physical investment.",

        "He/she argued that a very restrictive monetary policy for an extended period can jeopardize macroeconomic and financial stability, and affect consumption and investment.",
        "He/she mentioned that the analysis by a brokerage estimated a cost associated with the restrictive monetary policy of 0.7% of GDP in 2019 and of 1% in 2020.",
        "The same member noted that by affecting growth, it also has effects on the performance of both firms and the stock market, as well as on public finances, by increasing the financial cost of debt and lowering tax collection.",
        "The same member added that this makes domestic financial markets less attractive and affects risk premia and the exchange rate.",
        "For this reason, he/she considered that insofar as the inflation rate close to the target is consolidated, it will be necessary for monetary policy to transition towards a stance closer to neutral.",
        "Another member pointed out that the target rate in early 2019 was very restrictive, 3.4% in real terms, and with a spread of 575 basis points against that of the United States.",
        "He/she highlighted that, despite the interest rate cuts, an absolute easing was not achieved given that the real rate closed the year at 4.4%.",
        "As to the relative monetary policy stance, he/she noted that the spread against the United States decreased only by 25 basis points towards the end of the year, remaining as one of the highest spreads.",
        "He/she pointed out that it turns out to be even higher when considering the lower exchange risk, the greater risk appetite, and that no changes are expected in the accommodative monetary policies worldwide.",
        "He/she stated that, as to the absolute policy stance, economic slack demands a lower rate of return on capital, and that for such reason there must be consistency with the neutral rate.",
        "In sum, he/she considered that both stances point to the need for a greater rate easing in order to attain the primary objective at the lowest possible cost.",
        "stagnation responds to multiple factors.",

        "The same member pointed out that at this point it is important to acknowledge the limits and scope of monetary policy.",
        "He/she stated that, on the one hand, an overly restrictive policy may affect investment and consumption but it is not the main factor behind their loss of dynamism.",
        "The same member added that, on the other hand, the monetary policy implemented has yielded significant benefits in terms of financial and exchange rate stability and ensuring the purchasing power of wages.",
        "Another member mentioned that recent research suggests that given the high share of informality in the economy and the low credit penetration, the impact of the interest rate and credit channels to stimulate economic activity is limited, while the expectations channel is the predominant one to control inflation.",
        "He/she added that although a more significant monetary policy easing could improve the fiscal balance, it would not correct the structural problems of public finances.",
        "He/she also pointed out that the lack of dynamism of investment is due to the lack of certainty on public policies and concerns about domestic factors, such as governance, rule of law, and corruption, which remain as the major obstacles for private investment.",
        "In this regard, another member mentioned the importance of maintaining an environment of greater certainty, arguing that the central bank can contribute to that by ensuring macroeconomic and financial stability.",
        "One member mentioned that, given the development of core inflation, the challenge is for wage increases not to affect inflation and nullify the improvements in purchasing power attained.",
        "He/she estimated that inflationary pressures from the supply side are difficult to control with monetary policy, even more when they are the result of a medium-term policy, such as the wage policy.",
        "He/she pointed out that a wage policy is successful when it is able to permanently increase the purchasing power and generate better-paid jobs.",
        "He/she argued that caution and prudence must be applied in order to assess the best time to modify the rate of easing, taking into account that the goal is to contribute to improve the purchasing power of wages.",
        "Such member considered that although there are elements that suggest lowering the policy rate, given the persistence of core inflation and the permanent shock of wages, the balance of risks is uncertain in the short and medium terms.",
        "Most members pointed out the challenges faced by monetary policy.",
        "Some indicated the difficulty in reconciling an ample economic slack with inflationary pressures and mentioned that there is the prospect of postponing the consolidation of inflation around the target.",
        "One member pointed out that headline and core inflation expectations are converging to at that level, while long-term core inflation expectations have increased.",
        "If the aforementioned prevails, it would be a factor of concern that could be considered as a second-round effect on prices.",
        "Thus, he/she argued that there are signs that core inflation expectations are un-anchoring, in addition to which an environment of high uncertainty prevails.",
        "He/she considered that in this context the challenges for monetary policy have been exacerbated, thus it must continue to be conducted prudently.",
        "He/she mentioned that despite the cautious approach that has been followed, the risks of second-round effects on prices have increased.",
        "He/she argued that the central bank must focus on attaining its target within the time frame of monetary policy influence.",
        "He/she added that, at the same time, it must be ensured that the convergence to the target takes place in an orderly manner, avoiding potential costs for economic activity.",
        "economic slack has widened more than expected, the challenges faced by the economy are not only those associated with its cyclical position.",
        "He/she mentioned that there are other challenges and risk factors, both domestic and external, which affect the economy, the price formation process, and inflation.",
        "Such member noted that although under an inflation targeting framework monetary policy must be such that headline and core inflation forecasts remain around their target within the forecast horizon, it must also consider other elements.",
        "Among these, he/she mentioned the external environment, the greater amount of economic slack and the need to foster adequate conditions in financial markets.",
        "In addition to the above, he/she highlighted that monetary policy decisions must also: i) allow for an orderly adjustment of the economy; ii) consider the behavior of domestic and external yield curves and the corresponding risk premia; iii) maintain interest in Mexico as an investment destination and generate confidence; iv) consider the effects of the relevant relative monetary conditions; and, v) ensure the yield curve incorporates interest rate expectations consistent with the central bank targets within the time frame in which monetary policy operates.",
        "He/she argued that the latter implies that the adjustment of the monetary policy stance: i) must be done gradually to maintain the needed flexibility to face a wide range of scenarios and allow the required adjustments to be done in an orderly way; ii) must take into account all information available; iii) must fully respond to all expected factors and features of the Mexican economy and in a wide range of scenarios; and, iv) must lead to an orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to its target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates.",
        "The majority of members highlighted the consistent with the evolution of both the balance of risks for inflation and the economic juncture.",
        "One member stated that a prudent and gradual approach must be taken given the environment of uncertainty.",
        "Another member pointed out that under such circumstances the future actions of the monetary policy must rely on the available information at the time of the policy decision since attempting to provide a more precise guideline in an uncertain environment, can affect the central bank’s credibility.",
        "One member added that the message that the monetary policy stance is consistent with the attainment of the inflation target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates must be maintained.",
        "Another member argued that the rate of the adjustment must be considered period by period, must rely on incoming information, and must maintain a trajectory of inflation converging to the target.",
        "He/she underlined that a further deterioration of the balance of risks could limit taking advantage of the margin of maneuver for the relative and absolute policy stances in the future.",
        "Such member added that since the rate of adjustment affects expectations, a prudent policy adds to a sounder anchoring and maintains the central bank’s credibility.",
        "He/she pointed out that the central bank must remain alert as to avoid being complacent with a relatively low inflation but which is above the target.",
        "Nevertheless, one member considered important that such guideline acknowledges the convenience of adjusting the monetary policy stance to a less restrictive one in a relatively short period, with such an adjustment being conditioned to the favorable evolution of the inflation outlook.",
        "He/she argued that based on available information, it is possible to envision a scenario in which the interest rate’s neutral zone is attained by the end of this year.",
        "He/she estimated that a scenario like the above would not jeopardize the outlook for inflation but it would improve the economic perspectives.",

        "He/she stated that differences in economic recovery among countries are due to: (i) the rate of COVID-19 infections and the measures adopted to contain it; (ii) the relative importance of the most affected services; the informal sector; (iv) the strength of the macroeconomy and of the financial system, and (v) the magnitude of employment and income support programs.",

        "In this context, most members highlighted the risks to global economic growth associated with the pandemic, especially those related to the dynamics of infections and the establishment of additional social distancing measures.",
        "Some members considered that such measures may be less disruptive, as more information is available about which are the most effective public health actions.",

        "He/she noted that in the United States inflation of food products has increased, which has been largely offset by decreased pressures in services prices.",

        "Another member pointed out that in some emerging economies inflation was subject to upward pressures due to exchange rate depreciations and increases in energy and food prices.",
        "Most members mentioned that the central banks of advanced economies reiterated that they will maintain accommodative monetary policy stances for an extended period.",

        "On the supply side, most members highlighted the heterogeneity in the recovery of different sectors.",
        "Some members pointed out that the industrial sector, driven by manufacturing, has shown the best performance, while services continue to show weakness.",
        "One member outlined that industrial production fell at an annual rate of 29.4% in May and of 7.5% in September.",
        "He/she added that, in contrast, accommodation and food; transportation, information, and arts, entertainment and recreation services contracted at an annual rate of 53.4, 20.8 and 21.8% in August, respectively.",
        "Another member mentioned that tourism faces the most complex situation and that tourist sector businessmen estimate that the recovery could be achieved only until 2022.",
        "On the demand side, all members underlined that external demand has shown greater dynamism.",
        "The majority of members highlighted that in September exports reached levels close to those observed before the pandemic.",
        "Some members highlighted the trade balance surplus.",
        "Most members noted that consumption, investment and imports continue showing a lackluster performance.",
        "One member emphasized the weakness in the consumption of services and of durable goods.",
        "Another member stated that private consumption in August was 13.08% lower than in the previous year.",
        "He/she added that non-oil imports of consumer goods registered an annual contraction of remittances, which are a determinant of consumption, have continued to grow.",
        "He/she pointed out that in August investment registered an annual contraction of 16.64% as a result of the impact of the pandemic and an environment that is not conducive to investment.",
        "Most members noted that the labor market has started to recover, although it continues to show a considerable deterioration.",
        "They highlighted the reduction in the labor participation rate and increases in unemployment and underemployment.",
        "One member pointed out that in September, the labor participation rate was below underemployment rate was above 15%.",
        "He/she added that is outside of the labor force but available for work remains above 10%, as compared to 6% before the pandemic.",
        "Another member pointed out that while unemployment did not increase as much as in other crises, it continues to be disguised by the number of people that have left the labor market.",

        "Most members noted that the economic recovery will be gradual and prolonged.",
        "One member mentioned that, given the weakness of some aggregate demand components, it is foreseeable that the recovery will begin to slow down once the effects of the reopening of activities fade.",
        "Another member pointed out that the recovery will be difficult and thus could be extended until mid-2024.",
        "Some members noted that growth expectations for 2020 were revised slightly upwards.",
        "One member added that this was due to a stronger than expected rebound in the third quarter.",
        "He/she explained that according to the most recent surveys of private sector forecasters, growth expectations for 2020 changed from -9.8 to -9.3%, while they remained at GDP flash estimate for the third quarter points to a trajectory of economic activity during 2020 close to the less pessimistic scenario published in the Quarterly Report April-June 2020.",
        "One member added that he/she expects a GDP fall of 9.0% in In view of the economic contraction and the expected recovery scenarios, most members emphasized that wide slack conditions are foreseen in the horizon in which monetary policy operates.",
        "One member specified that, although the output gap will remain negative, the anticipated trajectory of economic activity implies a lower level of slack throughout the horizon in which monetary policy operates.",
        "Another member argued that, based on the GDP flash estimate for the third quarter, the negative output gap has started to decrease, although it still exhibits wide slack.",
        "He/she added that, in light of the current magnitude of the gap, in optimistic growth scenarios.",
        "He/she considered that it is difficult to estimate the output gap in the two-year horizon in which monetary policy has an effect, given the environment of uncertainty and the possibility that the potential growth of the economy is below the estimated figure.",
        "He/she indicated that it has most probably been affected by both weak investment and the absence of sufficient efforts to boost productivity since before the emergence of the pandemic, along with the effects of the latter on both physical and human capital stocks and on total factor productivity.",
        "Most members mentioned that an environment of uncertainty and downside risks to economic activity persists, especially risks related to a new outbreak of the pandemic.",
        "Some members warned about the possibility of new distancing measures being implemented.",
        "One member referred to states of Mexico that have once again adopted stricter lockdown measures —similarly to what has been observed in some European countries— and that consequently the economic outlook depends significantly on the virus’ trajectory.",
        "He/she stated that a resurgence of the virus could not only delay the economic recovery even more, which implies collateral damage to employment, but that additionally the pandemic represents a sizeable risk for the productive outlook in the medium term, which could cause structural damage to the economy.",
        "Another member pointed out the uncertain economic environment for 2020 and 2021.",
        "He/she stated that, despite promising news on the possibility of having a vaccine, there is still no certainty over when the vaccine or an effective treatment to the virus would be available, or over how long it would take to produce and distribute said vaccine, once it is available, in order for a relevant economic impact to be observed.",
        "Among risks for growth, some members highlighted the impact on public finances and its possible consequences on the conditions of access to financial markets.",
        "They indicated that other external risks of an economic, political and geopolitical nature should be added to the above.",

        "Most members mentioned that annual headline inflation increased between September and October and that it is above the 3% target.",
        "One member underlined that inflation in October was at its highest level in 17 months and that its evolution has exceeded Banco de México’s projections.",
        "Most members considered that inflation has continued to be affected by the pandemic, which has implied supply and demand shocks, as well as an exchange rate depreciation, which has led to changes in relative prices.",
        "Some members noted on the one hand the logistical and supplyrelated problems, and on the other the reallocation of consumers’ spending.",
        "One member stated that increases in prices caused by the closure of establishments and by logistical problems are beyond the traditional domain of monetary policy.",
        "Another member pointed out that the decline in aggregate demand and the fall in energy prices have favored price reductions.",
        "One member mentioned that the decline in demand has still not been reflected thoroughly on inflation.",
        "Regarding core inflation, most members highlighted the increase in the annual rate of change of merchandise prices, especially food merchandise, and reductions in that of services prices.",
        "One indicated that the decline in the prices of services has not compensated the price increases in those of merchandise, mainly food merchandise that are still at levels near 7%.",
        "Another member considered worrisome that in October, this component was practically at the upper limit of the variability interval of the inflation target for the third consecutive month.",
        "One member underlined that core inflation slightly decelerated during the second fortnight of October, showing an increase of only 7 basis points with respect to the previous fortnight.",
        "He/she mentioned that processed food prices, which had increased considerably in March and April, showed signs of stabilizing, even registering a slight deflation during the second fortnight of October with respect to the previous fortnight.",
        "Some highlighted that in October the annual change of services prices was 2.4%.",
        "One member pointed out that the lower annual rate of change in services prices reflects a lower demand generated by the social distancing measures.",
        "Another member mentioned that in the short term the negative output gap’s influence on inflation has been insufficient, given that fundamental core inflation has not decreased significantly.",
        "Most members expressed that non-core inflation increased, highlighting the rise in the annual rate of change of fruit and vegetable prices.",
        "One member noted that agricultural and livestock products’ prices unexpectedly rose at a faster rate in October, which explains why inflation was above the variability interval during said month.",
        "Another member pointed out that the less favorable dynamics in energy prices also drove non-core inflation upwards.",
        "Most members considered that there are signs of stabilization in some components of inflation.",
        "One member pointed out that this is due to the recent evolution of food merchandise, services and energy prices.",
        "Another member stated that the pressures on prices associated with value chain disruptions, input costs, energy prices and the exchange rate are starting to be contained.",
        "For this reason, an important decline in annual headline inflation is anticipated for November with respect to October.",
        "He/she added that distortions caused by the lockdown have made the reading of inflation difficult given that CPI’s fixed weights have become obsolete.",
        "He/she mentioned that the consumption pattern has changed, as the purchase of foods has increased and spending on transportation, apparel, recreation and tourism has decreased.",
        "In turn, the prices of the former group have increased more, while those of the latter group have increased less or even decreased, and thus households’ cost of living has increased more than is indicated by inflation.",
        "He/she considered that this goes beyond monetary policy’s usual domain.",
        "Some members stated that headline inflation expectations for the end of 2020 increased, while medium- and long-term expectations remained stable at levels above 3%.",
        "One member added that expectations for the end of 2021 rose as well.",
        "Another member noted that the latter still exceed the central bank’s projections by a relatively ample margin.",
        "One member noted that analysts will likely adjust their inflation expectations downwards for the end of the year, given that the impact on certain prices apparently has started to recede.",
        "Another member specified that private sector forecasters’ inflation expectations for the end of 2021 are at 3.5% and for the next 12 months have remained stable and below the level registered at the beginning of the pandemic.",
        "He/she added that expectations implicit in market instruments are at 3.2% for the average of one to five years.",
        "He/she considered that all of the above implies that inflation expectations have not been contaminated significantly by the recently observed inflation levels.",
        "Meanwhile, one member added that the 10-year inflation risk premium implicit in market instruments is still increasing.",
        "Most members considered that the recent behavior of headline and core inflation implies a slight increase in the foreseen trajectories within forecast horizon, although those for the next 12 to 24 months are anticipated to be around 3%.",
        "One member noted that this scenario considers a gradual fading of supply-related pressures and greater effects of economic slack on headline and core inflation within the forecast horizon.",
        "Some members pointed out that the convergence of inflation to the 3% target during the second half of feasible scenario.",
        "One member stated that headline and core inflation will probably remain relatively high over the next months and that it will be until mid-2021 when they will decrease considerably, as a result of both the direct and indirect impact of the fading of the base effect generated by the fall in oil prices during the second quarter of 2020.",
        "Another member underlined that despite a more appreciated exchange rate and the lower gasoline prices, expectations for headline and core inflation were adjusted to the upside throughout the forecast horizon, delaying the convergence to the target from the fourth quarter of 2021 to the first quarter of 2022.",
        "He/she pointed out that the higher prices of merchandise and agricultural and livestock products contributed to the above.",
        "Meanwhile, some members considered that inflation lies on the foreseen path to reach the target, although a transitory increase is expected during the second quarter of 2021.",
        "One member pointed out that this rebound in inflation is associated with a low comparison base.",
        "He/she mentioned that the decreasing trajectory is based on the expected or observed evolution of different determinants, highlighting that: i) energy prices remain relatively stable; ii) the exchange rate has appreciated significantly for seven consecutive months, thus reverting a sizeable fraction of the initial shock of the pandemic, and iii) the economy continues operating with a large amount of slack.",
        "Another member indicated that, despite current pressures, inflation is expected to decrease significantly during the second quarter of 2021 and the target is expected to be attained by the end of that year.",
        "He/she highlighted that there are signs of a moderation in the growth of prices that had increased the most.",
        "As for downward risks to inflation, most members highlighted the economic slack.",
        "One member added the possibility of lower inflationary pressures at a global level and a new outbreak of the virus lowering the demand for goods and services.",
        "Another member considered that, in general, inflation pressures observed so far are transitory and/or associated with supply-related factors.",
        "One member noted that the recent appreciation of the Mexican peso suggests lower pressures on prices in the following months.",
        "He/she added that the current nil fiscal pressure on inflation is positive.",
        "He/she mentioned that no new taxes or extraordinary increases in government-authorized prices have been registered, especially in energy prices, and thus non-core inflation could have a downward influence on inflation.",
        "Among upward risks, some members highlighted possible episodes of exchange rate depreciation.",
        "One member considered the behavior of the exchange rate as one of the main risks to inflation in the following months, as would be expected of such a liquid emerging economy currency as the Mexican peso.",
        "He/she added that the outcome of the US presidential elections and the recent news on the development of a vaccine have attenuated the considerable risks faced by inflation, although they have not eradicated them.",
        "Some members added that upwards pressures caused by the pandemic might continue.",
        "One member added the implications of a complex international context and domestic factors, such as the situation of public finances, the minimum wage increase for 2021, and the electoral process in Mexico in the following year.",
        "He/she considered that the wide output gap will prevail over the previous ones, but that the most recent forecasts suggest that the convergence of inflation to the target will take longer than foreseen.",
        "Another member underlined the risk of volatility in the financial markets, although he/she stated that it seems to be limited.",
        "Some members pointed out the persistence of core inflation at high levels.",
        "One member added that this phenomenon, observed since 2018, has worsened as a result of the pandemic through the food merchandise component, without the wide slack conditions having offset the upward pressures.",
        "He/she considered that the balance of risks to inflation has deteriorated.",
        "Another member noted that the balance of risks associated to the new foreseen trajectory for inflation is uncertain.",
        "Most members noted that financial markets exhibited a favorable behavior.",
        "One member stated that significant fluctuations were observed, caused mainly by the US elections and by the expectations about the availability of a vaccine against COVID-19.",
        "Most members highlighted that, in said context, the Mexican peso exhibited volatility and an appreciation.",
        "One member added that trading conditions in the foreign exchange market have recently improved.",
        "Another member mentioned that the Mexican peso has been one of the emergingeconomy currencies that has appreciated the most and added that, at the end of October, the negative balance of the net foreign-exchange position declined, reaching its lowest level since March.",
        "Most members pointed out that interest rates exhibited mixed and narrow adjustments.",
        "One member mentioned that short-term government bond rates registered marginal adjustments, while longterm ones increased.",
        "Another member underlined that the latter registered fluctuations.",
        "Some members underlined the decline in sovereign risk and the increase in the stock market.",
        "One member indicated that outflows in government securities were registered, although smaller than those observed in March and April.",
        "Some members mentioned that risks to financial markets persist and that new volatility episodes that could exert pressure on the exchange rate cannot be ruled out.",
        "One member highlighted the risks associated with the weakening of public finances, Pemex’s fragile situation, uncertainty about domestic policies, and possible non-compliance with the USMCA, as well as the 2021 electoral process.",
        "Another member stated that the decline in risk aversion depends on the world economic recovery, the possible economic stimuli, and the development of the vaccine.",
        "He/she pointed out that delays on these fronts would raise risk premia and financial volatility, and would exert pressure on the exchange rate.",
        "One member highlighted the challenges that are confronted given a large economic contraction, lower public revenues, spending pressures, as well as a deterioration of the terms of trade and lower revenues from abroad which has affected sovereign credit ratings and their perspectives.",
        "Moreover, public sector borrowing requirements have increased recently, in an environment in which uncertainty persists regarding domestic and external financing sources.",
        "Another member pointed out that from 2019 to 2020 the Public Sector Borrowing Requirements are projected to increase from 2.3 to 4.7% and that their historical balance will increase from 44.8 to 54.9% as a percentage of GDP.",
        "He/she mentioned that the fiscal balance could deteriorate further due to additional spending pressures generated by the lengthening of the pandemic.",
        "One member noted that the outlook for public finances for 2021 is complicated given the possibility of tax and oil revenues being lower than projected.",
        "He/she added that the latter, in an environment of depletion of resources from the stabilization funds and an unfavorable growth outlook, is one of the main risks for the sovereign rating and the economy, both in context, he/she emphasized the need for a fiscal reform.",
        "Another member stated that the risks associated with the outlook for public finances should not be overstated.",
        "He/she considered that a manageable deficit, even with small deviations with respect to the projections for 2021, and low public debt are consistent with macroeconomic balance.",
        "He/she stated that while assumptions of the economic package for 2021 may be optimistic, it is possible to keep the fiscal accounts in order.",
        "One member argued that considering the magnitude of the economic shock, public finances have performed relatively well.",
        "He/she added that the strong appreciation of the exchange rate from March to date has its origin in that the macroeconomic fundamentals of the country have remained solid, among which the observed commitment to fiscal discipline must be included.",
        "Some members expressed concern about Pemex’s situation.",
        "They added that this constitutes a risk for the sovereign rating and highlighted the possibility that the state company may require additional fiscal support, which could affect public finances.",
        "One member noted that in the event of a downgrade in the sovereign and/or Pemex’s ratings, the fiscal balance could deteriorate further.",
        "Another member stated that the possibility of an additional downgrade in Pemex’s rating has already been incorporated by the markets, so this event must be properly assessed.",
        "Most members stated that the impact of the pandemic continued affecting the financing of firms.",
        "One member noted that financing conditions remain tight, although they have improved compared to those observed during the beginning of the health crisis.",
        "Another member pointed out that domestic and external financing sources continued to increase during the third quarter.",
        "Nevertheless, most members highlighted the contraction in bank credit.",
        "Some members mentioned that this has mainly affected small- and medium-sized enterprises.",
        "One member pointed out that in September credit to these firms registered an annual contraction of -6.3%.",
        "He/she added that credit from commercial banks to firms and households remains weak, without clear signs of improvement.",
        "He/she stated that this situation is gravely affecting households.",
        "He/she mentioned that financing through credit cards declined at an annual rate of -11.5% and that other types of credit, such as payroll, personal and auto loans have also been declining.",
        "Some members pointed out that the credit contraction is due to low demand.",
        "One member mentioned the lack of firms’ confidence, legal uncertainty, and an adverse environment for investment.",
        "He/she stated that financial institutions have a perception of higher credit risk.",
        "Another member added that this is also due to banks’ tighter conditions and the absence of sufficient government guarantees.",
        "One member stated that the contraction is associated with supply factors and relatively high active rates.",
        "He/she emphasized the tightening of credit conditions for all sectors, which registered the most serious deterioration on record in the second quarter of 2020.",
        "He/she argued that this deterioration is largely explained by the reduction in credit lines offered.",
        "Some members noted that this decrease in bank credit is not due to a liquidity problem, considering the liquidity available to banks and the actions taken by the Central Bank in this matter.",
        "Some members argued that it is imperative for commercial banks and the government to stimulate credit through guarantee programs.",
        "One member noted that the availability of credit depends not only on central bank actions, but on the alternatives offered by banks.",
        "He/she stated that it is imperative for commercial banks to also do their part in the process of economic reactivation, and pointed out that the argument about an insufficient demand for credit is not credible.",
        "Another member mentioned that the economic recovery will be more difficult without an adequate expansion of bank credit.",
        "One member pointed out that although banks have solid capital and liquidity levels, the deterioration in their loan portfolio is still latent.",
        "He/she argued that the National Banking and Securities Commission encourage financial intermediaries to restructure credits of solvent clients that have liquidity problems and seek to minimize delinquency rates.",
        "He/she stated that the CNBV should expand even more, although prudently, the existing facilities so that institutions have additional reserves, increase their regulatory capital, and reduce their capital requirements due to credit risk.",
        "Another member highlighted that in view of the expiration of the special accounting criteria, it is important to monitor the stress indicators in the financial system.",
        "Taking into account the effects on inflation, economic activity and financial markets, as well as the projections for inflation and the convenience of consolidating a downward path for headline and core inflation towards the 3% target, the majority of members agreed to maintain the target for the overnight interbank interest rate at 4.25%.",
        "One member voted for lowering the policy rate to a level of 4.00%.",
        "All members agreed that the decision to keep the reference rate unchanged constitutes a pause, in order to confirm a trajectory for inflation that converges to the target.",
        "Some members mentioned that this pause should not be considered as the end of the monetary relaxation cycle.",
        "Looking ahead, all pointed out that monetary policy decisions will depend on the information available, particularly on the evolution of the One member stated that monetary policy faces, on the one hand, major supply and demand shocks that affect economic activity and inflation and, on the other hand, uncertainty in global financial markets and fragility in risk appetite and capital flows.",
        "He/she added that in order to have an orderly adjustment of the national economy and maintain low and stable inflation, financial markets must function properly.",
        "He/she noted that the effects of monetary policy throughout the yield curve must be identified, since the components of aggregate demand respond to the different segments of the curve.",
        "He/she mentioned that in view of the economic contraction and its effects on inflation, it is desirable that the entire curve presents an orderly and sustainable downward adjustment.",
        "He/she added that medium and longterm interest rates include risk premia associated with various factors and that monetary policy should seek to ensure that the medium- and long-term inflationary risk premia are low and contained.",
        "He/she considered necessary for inflation expectations to be kept around their target in a sustained manner, which reduces inflationary risk premia throughout the yield curve.",
        "He/she stated that this is important when evaluating monetary policy responses among emerging economies, since they generally need to complement their domestic savings with external sources of financing, and that their risk premia are relevant for this purpose.",
        "In this regard, he/she mentioned that a solid and resilient macroeconomic framework is required, capable of withstanding adverse scenarios and allowing for lower financing costs along the yield curve.",
        "He/she also emphasized that in light of the effects of the pandemic, the yield curve in Mexico has adjusted downwards in an orderly and sustained manner.",
        "He/she pointed out that when comparing the behavior of said curve among emerging economies, it stands out that short and long term interest rates in Mexico have decreased considerably.",
        "He/she pointed out that while short-term rates are lower in other emerging economies, in some of them longterm rates have decreased less or even increased.",
        "He/she noted that the challenge of maintaining low and stable risk premia has been complicated by the pandemic.",
        "He/she considered that given the challenges and disjunctives that monetary policy has confronted, in an environment in which headline and core inflation have been subject to pressures, despite the substantial weakness of economic activity, a pause would grant space to confirm the downward trajectory of headline and core inflation to the 3% target.",
        "Another member argued that monetary policy faces a complex scenario due to conflicting effects: the largest fall in GDP in ninety years contrasts with rising inflation that exceeds forecasts and inflation expectations above the target.",
        "He/she added the presence of various risks that could pressure the exchange rate and impose greater stress on the monetary policy stance.",
        "He/she stated that in light of the complex environment, it is time to make a pause in the cycle of monetary easing and that this is a consistent, prudent and cautious decision given the significant global and domestic uncertainty.",
        "He/she considered that such decision will reinforce the credibility about the central banks’ commitment to its primary mandate and will send an unequivocal message of prudence.",
        "The same member pointed out that currently the exante real interest rate is at an accommodative level and that the interest rate spread with respect to the Federal Reserve has reached a level below the one recorded during the 2009 crisis.",
        "The aforementioned in spite of greater domestic risks stemming from a more deteriorated fiscal position.",
        "Regarding the possibility that a cut to the policy rate is relevant for the reactivation of credit, he/she emphasized that recent data suggests that the interest rate channel has little influence on financing.",
        "He/she argued that actions in the sphere of monetary policy have been comprehensive and timely, but the impact on investment, credit and consumption has been limited, since these rely more on confidence and legal certainty.",
        "He/she added that this argument is reinforced when considering that the relevant interest rates for investment and consumption of durable goods are the medium and long term ones, which are currently at levels lower than during the recession of high sensitivity of capital flows in Mexico, it is imperative to maintain a cautious monitoring and to calibrate monetary policy, in order to avoid increasing the country's financial vulnerabilities, in an uncertain international environment and with a high country risk.",
        "Finally, he/she considered that the monetary policy statement must communicate that the decision seeks to guarantee the downward path of inflation to the target in the horizon in which monetary policy operates and that the prudent and responsible implementation of monetary policy is the best way to ratify the Central Bank’s commitment to price stability.",
        "One member argued that the monetary policy implemented in recent months has made a significant reduction in the reference rate compatible with an approach based on prudence.",
        "He/she noted that a de-anchoring of long-term inflation expectations has been avoided despite the shocks faced; the interest rate spread comparable with other emerging economies has been narrowed or inverted without exerting excessive pressures on the exchange rate, and long-term interest rates have remained at levels below those observed in several economies with lower reference rates.",
        "He/she mentioned that despite these efforts and the sharp economic contraction, mainly as a result of the shocks stemming from the pandemic, the inflationary situation remains difficult.",
        "He/she emphasized that in addition to inflation being above target, consideration must be given to the prolonged period in which core inflation has remained high, the persistence of short- and longterm expectations above the target, the risks to inflation in the coming months, as well as the fact that in the face of inflation data frequently exceeding forecasts during the year, the possibility of inflation converging to the target within the previously forecasted period seems to fade.",
        "He/she mentioned that many analysts anticipate that inflation for 2021 and in the long term will be above the target while also expecting that there will be cuts to the policy rate, which suggests doubts about the credibility of the commitment of the Central Bank to the target.",
        "He/she stated that, for all the above reasons, it is necessary to continue acting with prudence, which implies keeping the reference rate unchanged.",
        "He/she indicated that this represents the scenario to which information derived from market-based instruments assigns the highest probability.",
        "Finally, he/she considered that the duration of this pause will depend on the behavior of inflation and its expectations and forecasts, and that in an environment of so much uncertainty, flexibility in the implementation of monetary policy will be needed in order to ensure the convergence of inflation to the target.",
        "Another member argued that, from different perspectives, monetary easing is still insufficient and that a pause should in no way be interpreted as the end of the easing cycle.",
        "He/she noted that the exante real interest rate is still high in relation to that observed during the 2009 crisis, when the slack was lower than the current one and inflation expectations were higher.",
        "He/she added that said rate is also high in relation to that observed in the rest of the emerging economies.",
        "He/she mentioned that while in most economies real rates close to zero or negative were reached several months ago, in Mexico they are still in positive territory.",
        "He/she noted that monetary policy still has room to contribute to improve financing conditions without jeopardizing other aspects of the economy.",
        "He/she highlighted that interest rates faced by firms tend to decrease with monetary policy easing.",
        "He/she argued that the demand components typically associated with credit, such as investment, purchases of durable goods and purchases with credit cards, are those that have exhibited the weakest recovery.",
        "He/she emphasized that monetary easing should continue when inflationary pressures begin to ease and as long as the negative output gap continues.",
        "Otherwise, there may be costly implications during the recovery process and permanent effects on production and social welfare levels.",
        "One member argued that an even lower rate is needed to help the recovery process.",
        "He/she added that inflation lies on the foreseen trajectory and that the output gap will remain very negative for a long period, which gives room to continue with the current cycle of easing as most countries have done.",
        "He/she noted that the ex-ante real interest rate is still positive and that there is a margin before reaching a level of zero or negative.",
        "He/she noted that, given the difficulty of implementing a greater fiscal stimulus, a more expansionary monetary policy is needed and that it should be signaled that it will remain so for a long time.",
        "He/she also emphasized that the monetary stimulus must continue to be complemented with measures to increase liquidity, to address the functioning of the payments system, and to strengthen the financing channels for micro-, smalland medium-sized firms.",
        "With regards to the absolute policy stance, he/she noted that low economic activity and reduced risk aversion open space for further easing, although the temporary increase in inflation could reduce this margin for a few months.",
        "He/she argued that, in relative terms, the global monetary easing and the lower risk aversion allow for maintaining an accommodative policy stance.",
        "He/she stated that the end point of the easing cycle is uncertain, as it depends on inflation remaining on the expected path towards the target, the output gap being negative and the recovery continuing.",
        "He/she underlined that if on this occasion the monetary policy decision is not to modify the target rate, this has to be considered as a pause and not as the end point of the expansionary cycle, in order to leave the door open to a more expansionary stance as has been recommended by some international financial authorities.",
        "He/she noted that Mexico's inflationary gap is positive, in contrast to the negative gaps in most emerging economies, so future decisions should incorporate the evolution of economic indicators.",
        "In addition, he/she pointed out that caution should be maintained in order to avoid affecting exchange rate stability and the financial system.",
        "The risks for inflation, economic activity and financial markets pose major challenges for monetary policy and for the economy in general.",
        "Considering the mentioned forecasts for inflation and the convenience of consolidating a downward path for headline and core inflation towards the 3% target, with the presence of all its members, Banco de México’s Governing Board decided by majority to maintain the target for the overnight interbank interest rate at 4.25%.",
        "One member voted for lowering the policy rate to a level of 4.00%.",
        "This pause provides the necessary room to confirm that the trajectory of inflation converges to the target.",
        "Looking ahead, monetary policy implementation will depend on the evolution of the factors that have an incidence on headline and core inflation, on their foreseen trajectories within the forecast horizon, and on their expectations.",
        "The Governing Board will take the necessary actions on the basis of incoming information in order for the policy rate to be consistent with the orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to Banco de México’s target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates.",
        "Perseverance in strengthening the macroeconomic fundamentals and adopting the necessary actions regarding both monetary and fiscal policies will contribute to a better adjustment of domestic financial markets and of the economy as a whole.",
        "Alejandro Díaz de León-Carrillo, Irene EspinosaCantellano, Gerardo Esquivel-Hernández and Javier Eduardo Guzmán-Calafell voted in favor of maintaining the target for the overnight interbank interest rate at 4.25%.",
        "Jonathan Ernest Heath-Constable voted for lowering the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by My vote is for lowering the policy rate by 25 basis points to 4.0% and continue the downward cycle as far as possible.",
        "The main problem we face is the significant fall in economic activity, its impact on the labor market and expectations of a weak, difficult and prolonged recovery.",
        "Given the magnitude of the economic collapse, we should not overreact to inflation being temporarily one tenth of a percentage point above the variability range of its target.",
        "Given the difficulty in implementing greater fiscal stimuli, more is required from monetary policy; an even lower policy rate is needed to aid in the recovery process.",
        "If not addressed appropriately, the economy might suffer practically irreversible structural damages.",
        "The greatest possible support is therefore required, shifting from a current slightly expansionary monetary policy stance to a highly accommodative stance, and communicating that it will remain as such for a long period.",
        "Not even a pause in the policy stance is acceptable when a sensitive decline in inflation is expected in November as a result of the fall in energy and in fruit and vegetable prices, and of the discounts in many goods during the _Buen Fin_ sale.",
        "Most members mentioned that global economic activity has been recovering.",
        "Some members noted that in various advanced economies the recovery has been greater than expected.",
        "In this regard, one member highlighted the cases of the United States and, to a lower extent, the euro area.",
        "The majority of members stated that the economic performance has been heterogeneous economic activity is still far from pre-pandemic levels.",
        "Some members pointed out that the heterogeneity in pandemic contention measures and stimulus policies has influenced the differentiated recovery across economies.",
        "One member added that the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic, the relative importance of the most affected sectors, the labor market flexibility, the strength of the macroeconomy and public finances, as well as the adjustment and soundness of the financial system have also influenced these developments.",
        "Another member noted that, in aggregate terms, there was a greater dynamism of investment, production, and foreign trade, as well as a significant increase in private consumption.",
        "One member stated that the reopening of various sectors enabled a mild recovery of industrial production in advanced and emerging economies, while the recent behavior of consumption has responded to the stimulus measures adopted.",
        "He/she highlighted the cases of the United States and the euro area, where comparing the latest figures available with those at the end of 2019, consumption even increased.",
        "Another member emphasized the case of China, where industrial and capital goods’ production, as well as exports, exceeded pre-pandemic levels.",
        "Regarding the labor markets, he/she noted that various countries exhibited a favorable performance, although the euro area and Japan registered a significant reduction of hours worked.",
        "In this context of global economic recovery, most members pointed out that economic activity forecasts for 2020 have been adjusted upwards, while those for 2021 have been revised downwards.",
        "They mentioned that the world economy is subject to several risks, including those associated with the pandemic.",
        "Some members underlined the resurgence of infections in various countries.",
        "One member considered the possibility that lockdown measures could be extended or reestablished.",
        "He/she added that, although it is unlikely that these new measures would be as strict as in the early stages of the pandemic, they would imply significant costs for economic activity.",
        "Another member noted that although the reopening of activities may prompt a turning point in economies, recovery in the medium term will be associated with the permanent effects of the pandemic on the most affected sectors, as well as with the strength and support of consumption and investment, and the dynamics of external demand.",
        "One member argued that economic policy actions will continue to be a key determinant of the trajectory of the world economy in the short, medium and long terms.",
        "He/she stated that the stimulus provided by central banks has been reinforced.",
        "As for fiscal policy, he/she pointed out that the materialization of continuing support may face greater restrictions due to the absence of room for maneuver and to political factors.",
        "He/she added that trade policy will be crucial for the international flows of goods and services and the reconfiguration of global value chains.",
        "Most members mentioned that inflation in advanced economies remains below their central banks’ targets.",
        "The abovementioned despite the increase in food merchandise inflation and the rebound of energy prices.",
        "One member pointed out that inflation in these economies has remained low due to the fall in aggregate demand.",
        "Another member stated that the monetary authorities of these countries anticipate that headline and core inflation will remain below their targets for an extended period.",
        "Some members underlined that in a large number of emerging economies inflation is also below target as a result of the impact on services and the weakness of demand.",
        "In this regard, one member stated that, despite the greater slack, in some emerging economies, increases in energy and food merchandise prices, as well as the exchangerate depreciation, have led to positive deviations visà-vis their inflation targets.",
        "Most members mentioned that the monetary authorities of advanced economies are expected to maintain accommodative stances for an extended period.",
        "Some members highlighted the asset purchase programs implemented by these authorities.",
        "Regarding the Federal Reserve, the majority of members mentioned that in its September decision it maintained the range for the federal funds rate at 0-0.25%.",
        "Some members noted that its projections indicate that the rate will remain in such range at least until the end of 2023.",
        "The majority of members highlighted the announcement of a new monetary policy strategy that will maintain monetary stimulus until inflation is moderately above its 2% target.",
        "The majority also emphasized that this adjustment is due to the limitations faced by monetary policy to influence aggregate demand when the target rate is at the zero lower bound and inflation expectations remain persistently below the target.",
        "One member recalled how the impossibility of having a sufficiently low real interest rate during the financial crisis of 2008-09 led to a slower-thandesirable recovery of the US economy.",
        "He/she argued that the restriction on real interest rates was due to a combination of low inflation and a zero lower bound on the federal funds rate.",
        "In this regard, he/she stated that introducing the possibility of inflation remaining above 2% for some time would allow for a greater reduction of real interest rates, and thus the Federal Reserve anticipates that it could now be able to provide a greater stimulus to the economy.",
        "Some members added that the Federal Reserve also adopted a new definition of the full employment target, which will be used asymmetrically and respond only when employment is below maximum levels.",
        "One member pointed out that these adjustments are relevant due to the importance of the US dollar as a reserve currency and its role as a reference for investments in international financial markets, particularly in Mexico.",
        "He/she mentioned that, on the one hand, this strategy would delay interest rate increases until inflation is consolidated at levels above its target, thus decreasing expectations of short-term interest rates, and argued that this contributed to a depreciation of the US dollar after the strategy’s announcement, which deepened after September’s monetary policy decision.",
        "On the other hand, he/she considered that this new strategy introduces greater uncertainty about the future behavior of inflation, which may lead to higher inflation risk premia.",
        "In this regard, he/she noted that long-term interest rates increased slightly after the announcement.",
        "Some members pointed out that other central banks are also considering adjusting their monetary policy frameworks.",
        "Some members mentioned that the Bank of England is evaluating the possibility of adopting negative interest rates.",
        "One member added that most central banks of emerging economies have also privileged fostering accommodative financial conditions by setting low real interest rates to strengthen the flow of credit.",
        "He/she mentioned that ten out of 14 emerging countries analyzed have a negative ex-ante real interest rate.",
        "He/she added that even countries with an inflation level above their targets have cut their real interest rate to levels close to zero or below, while in Mexico the ex-ante real interest rate remains at positive levels.",
        "He/she noted that expectations for the average reference interest rate in emerging economies for the end of 2020 are below 3%.",
        "Most members agreed that global financial markets have shown a positive behavior in the last weeks, reflecting the effects of the measures implemented in advanced economies.",
        "One member added that the improvement in economic figures has also driven this behavior.",
        "Some members highlighted the generalized weakening of the US dollar against a broad group of currencies.",
        "One member underlined the narrow and mixed adjustments of interest rates and the steepening of the yield curve in the United States due to expectations of greater levels of inflation in the long term.",
        "As for financial markets of emerging economies, some members highlighted that in an environment of lower risk aversion, there were capital flows to fixedincome assets.",
        "However, one member added that flows to equity assets continued to register negative balances, partly due to the recent adjustments to growth expectations of emerging economies.",
        "Another emphasized that markets have exhibited some improvement in recent weeks and added that, despite showing some volatility, various emerging market currencies have appreciated against the US dollar and risk premia have diminished.",
        "Nevertheless, he/she mentioned that financial conditions observed at the beginning of the year, in terms of risk premia and value of emerging market currencies against the US dollar, have not been attained yet.",
        "One member added that in an environment subject to risks, there were recent episodes of volatility, in which the exchange rates of emerging economies’ currencies lost some of the ground gained during previous weeks.",
        "He/she added that these economies have faced lower commodity prices and negative impacts on other revenues, which led to downgrades and negative outlooks on sovereign ratings.",
        "Most members considered that international financial markets are subject to several risks.",
        "In addition to those associated with the pandemic, they mentioned: i) the US election process; ii) the escalation of trade tensions; iii) political and adjustment of the prices of some higher risk assets, such as the stocks of technology sector firms.",
        "In this context, one member mentioned that given these risks, although the external environment seems to be favorable, it is still a fragile equilibrium.",
        "Another member argued that emerging economies are particularly exposed due to their dependency on external financial conditions and to the idiosyncratic risks they face.",
        "One member added that the environment of economic weakness, uncertainty about the pandemic, lower public revenues and pressures on government spending, imply considerable challenges for emerging economies overall.",
        "He/she also highlighted that, in these economies, public sector’s borrowing requirements have increased considerably and that they could face greater restrictions in domestic and international financial markets.",
        "All members highlighted that, after a deep contraction in April and May, economic activity in Mexico began to recover in June and July.",
        "One member noted that during the second quarter of seasonally adjusted data, while another member added that it decreased 17.1% with respect to the first quarter of this year.",
        "highlighted the heterogeneity in the pace of recovery of different sectors.",
        "They pointed out that the industrial sector has exhibited the best particularly automotive, while, in contrast, services continue to show weakness.",
        "One member explained that industrial production fell at an annual rate of 11.6% in July, a smaller decline than the 30.1% contraction registered in April.",
        "He/she added that construction has shown a slower recovery and contracted at an annual rate of 23.7% in July.",
        "He/she stated that services remain weak, particularly those related to accommodation, which contracted at an annual rate of 28.6% in June, and arts, entertainment and recreation and food services, which fell 68.8%.",
        "Another member mentioned that the tertiary sector is expected to recover at a slower pace than the secondary sector as long as all activities are not fully reopened.",
        "As for the demand side, most members agreed that its recovery has been driven by the external sector.",
        "Some members underlined that exports started to increase in June.",
        "One member stated that, compared to December 2019, exports rose from stated that exports are expected to be the driving force behind demand.",
        "Most members highlighted that consumption and investment remain sluggish.",
        "One member added that the behavior of imports, consumption and investment points to a slow recovery of domestic demand.",
        "Another member highlighted the sharp fall in consumption in April and its recovery in June and July, although he/she underlined that it continues to be far below the level observed at the end of 2019, which contrasts with the recovery of this aggregate in some advanced economies that have implemented economic relief programs.",
        "One member pointed out that, in August, several consumption indicators registered levels close to those prior to the pandemic, while other indicators, such as credit card purchases or domestic car sales, remain deteriorated.",
        "Another member mentioned that remittances, which are a determinant of consumption, continue increasing, although with heterogeneity among sender and receiver states.",
        "One member highlighted that investment has not shown signs of recovery and that its weakness can be seen in the figures of the second quarter and in the timely indicators of construction and capital goods imports.",
        "Another member underlined that investment is facing the effects associated with the pandemic and that, as a result, in April it contracted at an annual rate of 38.2%, and in June it registered a level 25.2% lower than that of the previous year, as well as an environment unfavorable for investment, as stands out in the results drawn from business opinion surveys.",
        "All members underlined the large impact on the labor market, although one of them highlighted that said market has started to normalize gradually.",
        "Most members pointed out that the underemployment rate, unemployment rate and the rate of workers who are not part of the labor force but who are available to work, remain at high levels.",
        "Some members pointed out that the unemployment rate rose from 2.9% in March to 5.4% in July.",
        "One member noted that, following the outflow of over 12 million workers from the labor force, as of July 7.2 million workers had rejoined the labor force.",
        "Another member underlined that, although the labor participation rate has recovered to a level of 55%, it is below the average level of the last 6 years, of approximately 59%.",
        "He/she added that it could take several years to return to the employment levels observed prior to the pandemic.",
        "One member added that almost 6 million jobs were lost between March and July, with and extended unemployment rate of historically high levels, with 23.3 million people in need of full-time jobs.",
        "Another member noted that, despite the improvement, 5.4 million workers left the labor force between March and July and added that the jobs created after May have been mainly in the informal sector.",
        "One member indicated that, as a consequence of the above and of the increase of underemployment, a loss of job quality is observed, with individuals who have returned to their jobs but are now earning lower wages.",
        "He/she added that there are differentiated effects by gender, which will require particular attention.",
        "Some members stated that formal employment, measured through the number of IMSS-insured workers, contracted by over one million during the first seven months of the year.",
        "Some members highlighted that formal employment showed a slight recovery in August.",
        "Most members emphasized that the economic added that it is subject to uncertainty.",
        "One member pointed out that a 10% contraction is anticipated in 2020 and emphasized that the magnitude of the recovery over the next months is key to determine how long it will take to return to the levels of economic activity observed during the third quarter of 2018, in order to end the recovery phase and start an expansion phase.",
        "He/she estimated that the recovery phase might last from two to six years, or even up to a decade if per capita GDP is considered.",
        "Another member underlined that, given the difficulty to forecast a central scenario for economic growth, Banco de México has maintained three scenarios with different recovery trajectories, depending on the evolution of the pandemic and the performance of advanced economies and domestic demand, all of which continue to be subject to a high degree of uncertainty.",
        "One member pointed out that, based on the most recent surveys, private sector analysts already estimate the Mexican economy’s long-term growth to be below 2%.",
        "Most members agreed that wide slack conditions are anticipated throughout the horizon in which highlighted that there are downward risks to implications for productive activity derived from the evolution of the pandemic.",
        "One member mentioned a high probability of a second wave of infections in the short term, mainly associated with the easing of lockdown measures, a situation that could become more complicated in view of the beginning of the influenza season.",
        "He/she added that, even with a vaccine available, a recovery that relatively quickly offsets the contraction registered in imbalance in the determinants of GDP growth is foreseen to persist during 2021.",
        "He/she stated that a higher-than-expected growth of the US economy and of world trade, combined with the USMCA, should stimulate exports.",
        "Nevertheless, he/she warned that consumption will recover more slowly due to the high levels of unemployment, fears of virus contagion, and the absence of sufficient fiscal support.",
        "He/she pointed out that the latter factor and an unfavorable business climate would limit the recovery of private investment.",
        "In addition to the above described risks to growth, another member added the following: i) that the negative effects on goods and services’ production and on businesses and households’ revenues continue; ii) that additional episodes of risk aversion in financial markets are observed; iii) pressures on public revenue, which could affect the sovereign risk outlook and the conditions of access to financial markets, and iv) solvency problems of households and businesses affected by the pandemic.",
        "All members pointed out that in August, headline inflation ended above 4%.",
        "Most members highlighted that, with this, it exceeded the upper limit of the variability interval around the 3% target.",
        "One member stated that in that month inflation registered its highest level since May 2019.",
        "Another member added that it has increased over the last four months, as compared to the downward trend observed in numerous advanced and emerging economies.",
        "Most members considered that inflation has continued to be affected by the pandemic, which has implied supply and demand shocks, thus contributing to a recomposition in relative prices.",
        "One member mentioned that these adjustments took place in the context of a marked weakness of demand.",
        "He/she highlighted that seasonally adjusted monthly changes of the items that registered upward shocks in recent months have started to show variations closer to their average of the last ten years.",
        "Another member argued that supply and demand shocks, and the behavior of the exchange rate, are reflected in both the divergent evolution of merchandise and services’ prices and in the contrasting price increases of different items of the CPI basket.",
        "He/she noted that slightly more than a half of said basket registers annualized monthly price increases higher than 4% and close to a third annualized monthly price increases below 2%.",
        "He/she pointed out that headline inflation has remained high and above the expected level as certain upward risks to the core component have materialized.",
        "One member mentioned that inflation of services and of energy prices are below their respective historical average levels, while prices of food merchandise and agricultural and livestock products register cumulative inflations above said levels, although the most recent data suggests these have somewhat moderated or stabilized.",
        "Delving into the core component, all members mentioned that services inflation remains low and merchandise inflation has increased.",
        "One member pointed out that services prices have been affected by a lower demand caused by social distancing measures and by lower private spending.",
        "Another member stated that services inflation is below the target level, although this has not offset the upward pressures in merchandise prices.",
        "One member noted that the lower services inflation has moderated, which, in addition to the increases in merchandise inflation, has led to upward pressures on core inflation.",
        "Some members stated that food merchandise prices have been pressured by supply chain disruptions, changes in the consumption basket, and the concentration of spending on these goods.",
        "One member added that changes in the excise tax (special tax on production and services, also known as IEPS) on soft drinks and tobacco have also affected said prices.",
        "Another member highlighted that pressures stemming from merchandise prices have become generalized, given that, although food prices register higher annual increases, non-food prices are contributing to a larger extent to the acceleration of inflation.",
        "As for non-core inflation, most members underlined the increase in energy prices.",
        "One member added that the evolution of these prices reflects the impact of reductions in supply and the recent recovery of world economic activity.",
        "Some members noted the increase in agricultural and livestock prices.",
        "Some members mentioned that headline inflation expectations for the end of 2020, and to a lower extent for 2021, have increased.",
        "One member considered that this suggests that the less favorable outlook has started to extend to the following year.",
        "Another member noted that expectations for the end of 2021 are far above those of the Central Bank and added that short-term core inflation expectations have also continued to increase.",
        "Some members added that medium- and long-term expectations remained stable at levels above the 3% target.",
        "In this regard, one member highlighted that the dispersion around 3.5% has practically disappeared, which indicates a stronger entrenchment of long-term expectations at levels above the target.",
        "Another member considered that despite the recent increase in observed inflation, inflation expectations for both the medium-term and for the end of 2021 have remained stable, while those for the next 12 months have decreased after having increased at the beginning of the pandemic, although they remain above the 3% target.",
        "He/she added that the average of one to 10 years of annual inflation expectations implicit in market instruments was of around 3% in September, which suggests that the recent price increases are considered as transitory and have not contaminated inflation expectations.",
        "All members pointed out that inflation is anticipated to converge to the target in the horizon in which monetary policy operates.",
        "One member noted that, in the expected scenario, inflation is estimated to show in the short term the effects of some recent price adjustments.",
        "He/she pointed out that in the 12-to-24 month forecast horizon, headline and core inflation are anticipated to be around 3%.",
        "Another member considered that, looking forward, prices will remain contained by both a depressed demand and low energy prices.",
        "He/she stated that some sectors that exhibited increases in sales and in prices, due to a recomposition in spending, have already started to be affected by the decrease in aggregate demand.",
        "One member estimated that, due to their nature, both supply shocks and other upward pressures on certain products derived from the pandemic should fade off or, at least, be mitigated, once the health problem is resolved, while economic weakness will most probably persist for a longer period.",
        "In this context, some members argued that the effect of the contraction of demand on prices should prevail, thus contributing to the convergence of inflation to its target.",
        "One member mentioned that supply and demand pressures on inflation are foreseen to continue until the first half of 2021, to later decelerate and reach the target by the end of that year.",
        "He/she pointed out that core inflation is still subject to pressures derived from increases in energy prices, the exchange rate and wages.",
        "He/she pointed out that the food merchandise subcomponent has been particularly under pressures stemming from tax adjustments, supply chain disruptions, and changes in consumption baskets.",
        "Nevertheless, he/she stated that these are expected to be transitory.",
        "Another member mentioned that both headline inflation and its components continue on an upward trend, despite the wide slack and the exchange rate appreciation.",
        "He/she noted that, while inflation is still anticipated to converge to 3% during the fourth quarter of 2021, the foreseen trajectory has been adjusted upwards for the entire forecast horizon.",
        "As to the balance of risks for inflation, some members highlighted the risk of additional episodes of exchange rate depreciation.",
        "One of them stated that this is particularly relevant in an environment characterized by numerous domestic and external challenges.",
        "In addition to the above, he/she underlined that the inflation scenario also faces different risks stemming from the recent performance of inflation and the relative impact of supply and demand shocks.",
        "Another member stated that further impacts from the supply side cannot be ruled out.",
        "One member mentioned the persistence of core inflation, highlighting that it has averaged 3.7% over the last 30 months, and that it is expected to continue until March 2021.",
        "He/she added that although the trajectory of non-core inflation is difficult to anticipate, it could reverse to its historic mean of around 6%, causing a deviation from the baseline scenario.",
        "He/she also underlined the risk of inflation expectations de-anchoring, since inflation has remained above the target for an extended period, although he/she stated that analysts agree that said deviation is transitory.",
        "He/she added the risk associated with the impact of the wage policy and expectations of a considerable increase in 2021.",
        "He/she pointed out that, since 2018, unit labor costs have increased and productivity has declined, which implies that profit margins have decreased and/or a partial or a total pass-through effect to prices has taken place.",
        "In this context, some members considered that the balance of risks for the foreseen inflation trajectory remains uncertain.",
        "One member indicated that, despite the above, upward risks have increased.",

        "Most members pointed out that the situation of public finances is a risk factor.",
        "In this regard, one member stated that between 2019 and 2020, Public Sector Borrowing Requirements will increase from from 44.8 to 54.7% as a percentage of GDP.",
        "Some members noted that the economic package for 2021 represents a continuation of the policy of the previous two years, with an emphasis on an austere management of public finances and on channeling spending to the current administration’s priority programs.",
        "Another member highlighted the modest increase proposed for health spending and the cuts in public investment to its lowest level in 20 years.",
        "He/she emphasized that resource allocation and social profitability of the projects to be financed will compromise the country’s growth potential even further.",
        "Some members highlighted the risk that the depletion of the stabilization funds’ resources implies for 2021.",

        "He/she added that the spread between the rate that these firms face and the risk-free interest rate continued to increase, which implies that the cost of credit is not decreasing at the same rate as the reference rate, thus making it difficult to restore credit flows.",
        "Another member noted that although there was a tightening in bank financing conditions, the adjustments have moderated recently.",

        "Taking the referred risks for inflation, economic activity and financial markets into account, major challenges arise for monetary policy and for the economy in general, and based on the foreseen scenarios for inflation and considering the room for maneuver that on balance these provide to monetary policy, all members agreed to lower the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 25 basis points to a level of 4.25%.",
        "All members considered that monetary policy implementation will depend on the evolution of the factors that have an incidence on the outlook for inflation and its expectations, including the effects that the One member mentioned that among the challenges faced by monetary policy under the current complex environment, the significant supply and demand shocks which affect economic activity and inflation, as well as the fragility prevailing in global financial markets and risk appetite, which are subject to episodes of volatility and capital outflows, stand out.",
        "He/she highlighted that inflation has continued to suffer the effects of the pandemic and has increased in recent months.",

        "He/she added that in order to consolidate an orderly adjustment of the national economy and maintain low and stable inflation, the well-functioning of domestic financial markets is required.",
        "Considering the above, he/she highlighted monetary policy’s limited room for maneuver, and that in the future the available room will depend on the evolution of the factors that influence inflation forecasts.",
        "Another member pointed out that at the beginning of the pandemic, monetary policy faced unprecedented challenges, since the possible impact of this shock on the economy, its duration, depth, scope and risks were unknown.",
        "He/she added that currently there is valuable, available information that should be considered for the monetary policy decision, although high uncertainty persists.",
        "He/she mentioned that, although a favorable evolution of financial markets has been observed, price dynamics, the evolution of inflation expectations, as well as the persistence of uncertainty worldwide and of idiosyncratic risk factors indicate that prudence and caution should be reinforced when conducting monetary policy.",
        "He/she considered that with the referred reduction of 25 basis points, the space for monetary easing has probably been exhausted, which will allow for inducing the trajectory of inflation and its expectations to its 3% target in the horizon in which monetary policy operates.",
        "Finally, he/she highlighted that the monetary policy announcement has to communicate that the trajectory and current levels of inflation have reduced the margin of maneuver for future target rate cuts and that future decisions will depend on the deviations that are observed in the trajectory of inflation to the 3% target.",
        "One member pointed out that given the uncertainty about the impact of the pandemic on the economy, there is no clear information about how the main macroeconomic aggregates will behave during monetary policy’s period of influence.",
        "He/she noted that the statistical exercises conducted suggest that the convergence of inflation to the target is feasible during the second half of 2021, even with a further reduction to the monetary policy rate.",
        "However, he/she emphasized that upward risks to inflation have increased.",
        "In this regard, he/she underlined that in recent weeks inflation reached levels above Central Bank’s expectations and the target, which has resulted in a certain increase in the forecasts for coming months.",
        "On the other hand, he/she added that adjustments to the reference rate since August comparable interest rate spread relative to other emerging economies, posing challenges to an economy highly exposed to capital movements and with a very liquid currency in international markets.",
        "He/she pointed out that this is happening in a context where inflation expectations for both the second half of 2021 and the long term have not converged to the target.",
        "He/she added that the latter is combined with other sources of uncertainty in addition to those associated with the pandemic, such as, among others, the US presidential elections, the challenges for Pemex and for public finances in Mexico, the risks to the sovereign’s rating which could even affect the investment grade, a wage policy for 2021 still to be defined, and an important electoral process in Mexico in that year.",
        "He/she considered that, under these circumstances, the implementation of a monetary policy that is even more prudent than in previous months, is necessary.",
        "He/she pointed out that this implies not only slowing down the pace of monetary policy easing, but also acknowledging that the margins of maneuver for additional easing have probably already been exhausted, which underlines the convenience of beginning a pause after this decision, although he/she recognized that this will depend on the evolution of inflation and its expectations.",
        "Another member considered that the referred reduction of 25 basis points would benefit the Mexican economy without putting price stability at risk.",
        "He/she mentioned that the cycle of monetary easing should slow down, but that there is space to continue, since from various perspectives, in his/her opinion, the monetary easing is still insufficient.",
        "Comparing the current situation with the 2009 crisis, he/she pointed out that GDP fell -6.5% in the first nine months of 2009, while in the first six months of 2020, it did so by -10.1%.",
        "He/she added that inflation and its expectations are currently behaving more favorably than eleven years ago.",
        "He/she highlighted that inflation expectations for the next 12 months are at 3.58%; while in 2009 they were well above 4% and even exceeded 5% at some point.",
        "He/she added that the persistence of monthly inflation has been reduced to less than half the level of 2009, thus contributing to prevent expectations from being contaminated.",
        "Thus, he/she considered that these elements allow for a policy easing at least equivalent to that of 2009, when monetary easing took the real interest rate even to negative levels.",
        "He/she argued that making a pause in the current cycle of easing would imply ignoring Banco de México’s achievements and would deprive the economy of an additional impulse, which might be highly beneficial and very necessary in the current conditions.",
        "In this regard, he/she pointed out that several studies show that monetary policy’s credit channel operates in Mexico.",
        "He/she said that an accommodative monetary policy can reduce credit costs, thus contributing to its flow to households and firms.",
        "He/she referred to different, credit-related areas of demand that remain depressed, such as credit card purchases, domestic car sales, and investment.",
        "He/she considered that, for this reason, monetary policy is still insufficient and might yet play a significant role in the economic recovery process.",
        "He/she added that the negative economic effects associated with a very high real interest rate are documented in the literature.",
        "In this regard, he/she referred to the case of the United States during the global financial crisis and the recent change in the monetary policy strategy of the Federal Reserve.",
        "On the other hand, he/she argued that although inflation in Mexico is higher than in other emerging economies, the key variable is the real ex-ante interest rate, which depends on inflation expectations and not on observed inflation.",
        "He/she pointed out that the expected inflation in Mexico has not changed significantly and is well anchored, so that real ex-ante rates are positive, which could eventually be incompatible with a sustained recovery.",
        "He/she considered that it would not be convenient to send a signal that the cycle of monetary easing has ended.",
        "He/she pointed out that the current conditions of the Mexican economy could be aligned with what other central banks are doing and contribute to the recovery process, without jeopardizing the priority objective of price stability.",
        "One member considered that monetary easing should continue given the depressed economic activity that faces a difficult, fragile and potentially long recovery.",
        "However, he/she pointed out that it is advisable to adjust its speed and focus carefully on the performance of economic indicators in the following months.",
        "In his/her opinion, this adjustment is due to four factors.",
        "First, he/she mentioned the described inflationary outlook.",
        "In this regard, he/she highlighted that the increase in current inflation may not be temporary and that several shocks may shift inflation away from its expected trajectory.",
        "Second, he/she mentioned that the room for maneuver offered by the absolute and relative monetary policy stances is starting to narrow.",
        "Regarding the absolute policy stance, he/she noted that the temporary increase in inflation has partially offset the room for maneuver offered by the economic slowdown.",
        "As to the relative stance, he/she mentioned that there is room for maneuver due to both the expectation that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates low for a prolonged period and the containment of risk aversion worldwide.",
        "However, he/she considered that Mexico’s interest rate spread is not so high when considering exchange rate volatility, so each additional reduction must be done with caution.",
        "He/she noted that with increased risk appetite and the marked foreign exchange rate appreciation observed in the last weeks, the interest rate spread is likely to become more relevant.",
        "He/she added that portfolio outflows seem to have stopped, although we are still far from regaining the investment flows lost due to the shocks of the pandemic.",
        "Third, he/she noted that maintaining the current pace of easing could be interpreted as the price stability objective taking second stage.",
        "He/she added that the cut to the policy rate has a limited impact, as the credit channel is inefficient due to limited credit depth and low financial inclusion.",
        "In contrast, he/she considered that the expectations channel has shown a greater effectiveness.",
        "In this regard, strengthening the central bank’s credibility regarding its commitment to contain the price increases is fundamental.",
        "Fourth, he/she referred to the idiosyncratic risks related to public finances and uncertainty for investment, among others mentioned above.",
        "Finally, he/she highlighted the importance of never disregarding the inflationary concerns and preventing the loss of purchasing power from further eroding households, which currently face a significant decline in their income.",
        "Most members noted that the extraordinary measures adopted by the Central Institute have mitigated the impact of the crisis on the financial system.",
        "The majority highlighted the importance of recently extending these measures until February 28, 2021, for the well-functioning of financial markets, given the challenges that continue to be faced.",
        "Additionally, some members pointed out the need to monitor the restructuring of credit portfolios subject to the special accounting criteria, in view of their expiration, as this could have implications for financial stability, and highlighted the risks to the payment capacity of the households and firms most affected by the pandemic.",
        "One member also underlined the potential challenges for the financial system as the crisis begins to be reflected more evidently in the solvency of some firms.",
        "Taking into account the referred risks for inflation, economic activity and financial markets, major challenges arise for monetary policy and for the economy in general.",
        "Based on the foreseen scenarios for inflation and considering the room for maneuver, although narrow, that on balance these provide to monetary policy, with the presence of all members, Banco de México’s Governing Board decided unanimously to lower the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 25 basis points to a level of 4.25%.",

        "Some members underlined that economic activity is still far from the levels prior to the pandemic.",
        "One member stated that the strongest repercussions were registered in manufactures, person-to-person services, and small businesses.",

        "Another member pointed out the possibility of higher delinquency rates of credits to businesses and households, although in some economies the relief programs have eased this risk.",
        "He/she added that low commodity prices imply lower public revenues and a deterioration in the terms of trade in various emerging economies.",
        "He/she noted that, unlike advanced economies that have a reserve currency, the higher public sector borrowing requirements in emerging economies will exert pressure on the availability of financial resources.",
        "Finally, some members mentioned the risk of a resurgence of trade conflicts, as well as political and geopolitical factors.",
        "Most members mentioned that headline and core inflation in advanced economies are below the targets of their respective central banks.",

        "Some members noted that in various emerging economies, inflation also remains at low levels.",

        "One stated that in these economies, the financial shock was intensified by the fall in commodity prices and in other external revenues, which led to downgrades in the ratings and outlook of sovereign risk, thus strengthening the financial shock in a procyclical manner.",

        "Among the risks for growth, some members mentioned the possibility that the impact on the production of goods and services and on firms’ and households’ incomes will continue.",
        "One member added that pressures on public revenue may affect the sovereign risk outlook and that households’ and firms’ solvency problems may put pressure on the financial system.",
        "In the external environment, in addition to the abovementioned global risks, another member included a slower than expected recovery in advanced economies, particularly in the United States.",
        "One member underlined that such risks are intensified by the modest support of fiscal policy and added that in light of the possibility of new COVID-19 outbreaks, a second episode of contraction cannot be ruled out.",
        "Another member mentioned that the degree of fragility of the economic recovery is high taking into account the medium- and long-term damage to businesses and investment, the latter of which was already affected before the health crisis emerged.",
        "Most members pointed out that economic growth is subject to significant Most members agreed that greater economic slack is expected within the time frame in which monetary policy operates.",
        "Some members stated that economic slack increased significantly due to the impact from the pandemic.",
        "They added that there is now a greater slack than that registered in previous crises, such as those of 2008-2009, 1995 and at the beginning of the eighties.",
        "One member mentioned that while in the worst month of 2009 the output gap was -7%, in April 2020 it was close to -24%.",
        "Most members mentioned the increase of annual headline inflation, due to increases in both its non-core and core components.",
        "Some members pointed out that, despite the sharp economic weakness, the recent path of inflation has recently surprised to the upside.",
        "In this regard, one member considered that inflation dynamics should be analyzed, given that headline inflation and its components have registered levels consistently above forecasts, despite the wide economic slack and the peso exchange rate appreciation.",
        "He/she added that, in this context, the disinflationary effect attributed to the cyclical component of economic activity should be reconsidered.",
        "Another member considered that headline inflation’s increase in July does not put price stability at risk.",
        "He/she stated that the recent increase should not distract us from the favorable evolution exhibited by several of its components.",
        "The majority of members pointed out that the evolution of non-core inflation has responded mainly to the behavior of energy prices.",
        "They highlighted that these prices have increased after having fallen sharply in March and April, which has contributed to the rise of non-core inflation.",
        "One member stated that the above has occurred after this component registered in April a negative annual rate of change for the first time in history.",
        "Another member stated that, despite the increase in energy prices, they remain below the level registered at the beginning of the year.",
        "He/she added that the lower commodity prices, particularly of fuels, and their effect on production costs have a favorable impact on inflation.",
        "All members mentioned that within core inflation, effects in opposite directions are observed, with a decrease in the annual rates of change of merchandise, with high annual rates of change in food prices.",
        "Most members pointed out that services prices have reflected the weakness of demand.",
        "As for merchandise prices, they highlighted that these are being affected by supply and demand shocks and by the exchange rate adjustments.",
        "One member considered that these effects intensified the inflationary pressures on international food prices that have been observed since last year.",
        "These upward pressures in merchandise prices represent a significant rearrangement in relative prices given the slowdown of services prices.",
        "Another member noted that such pressures, which concentrated on food merchandises initially, have spread to non-food merchandises and considered worrisome that core inflation is following a higher than expected path, emphasizing that in July it reached its highest level in thirteen months.",
        "Some members mentioned that the increase in food merchandise prices may be due to a change in consumption patterns as a result of the pandemic.",
        "One member considered that, although they may be putting upward pressures on the prices of these merchandises, disruptions in supply chains are transitory and that the exchange rate depreciation may explain only part of these price increases.",
        "He/she argued that such increases may be due to the existence of firms with market power, which, in face of an increased demand, may increase their prices and profit margins.",
        "He/she considered that this could also explain why inflation is greater in Mexico than in other countries with currencies that have depreciated in an equal or greater magnitude.",
        "He/she added that these factors act on the supply side and do not imply sustained shocks on prices, and, therefore, little can be done by monetary policy to contain them.",
        "He/she also mentioned that a weak demand may be putting downward pressures on the prices of some merchandise items, such as clothing and shoes, which have even registered deflation.",
        "Most members stated that the recent inflation adjustments contributed to an increase of headline inflation expectations for the end of 2020, while those for the medium and long terms have remained at levels above the 3% target.",
        "One member noted that, after April, expectations for the end of 2020 have remained above Banco de México’s target.",
        "Another member highlighted the contrast between the median of forecasters’ expectations for 2021 and those of the Central Bank.",
        "He/she added that long-term expectations have become more firmly entrenched above the target, given the increasingly lower dispersion around 3.5% observed for headline inflation and the increase during this year of core inflation expectations, to practically 3.5%.",
        "He/she considered that prospects of a relatively high inflation until the second quarter of expectations more difficult.",
        "Another member argued that the general reading of different instruments that measure expectations is that these are contained despite the recent increase of inflation.",
        "He/she added that expectations drawn from market instruments lay at 3.2% for the 1-10 year average.",
        "As for the future path of inflation, one member noted that Banco de México’s scenario in the short term reflects the effects of some recently observed price adjustments.",
        "He/she pointed out that such adjustments have led to increases in core inflation and, in the case of non-core inflation, some comparison base effects are expected on energy prices.",
        "Nevertheless, he/she specified that, in the 1224-month forecast horizon, both headline and core inflation are expected to lay around 3%.",
        "Another member stated that supply shocks are foreseen to fade over time and, in light of the outlook of a very wide negative output gap, it seems reasonable to anticipate that inflation will converge to the target during the second half of 2021.",
        "One member considered that the recent rise of inflation does not imply a major concern for inflation ahead.",
        "He/she mentioned that data for the second fortnight of July is consistent with these expectations since it shows signs of stabilization in energy prices and in food merchandise prices at the margin.",
        "Another member stated that the dynamics within the components of inflation has led to an upward adjustment of forecasts.",
        "He/she considered that the risk of inflation failing to converge to the target within the forecast horizon has increased and that deviations appear to be increasingly less attributable to transitory factors.",
        "He/she also highlighted that such deviations have a regressive impact since they mostly affect the lower income deciles.",
        "One member noted that the behavior of inflation will reflect the effects of adjustments in relative prices that are taking place and those of the profound weakness of both global and domestic aggregate demand.",
        "He/she mentioned that these factors are also occurring in other economies, although in most of them the impact of a weak demand has prevailed.",
        "He/she stated that, in contrast with Mexico, in advanced and in a large sample of emerging economies, headline and core inflation lay at levels clearly below their target.",
        "He/she highlighted that, in such economies, both inflation and output gaps point in the same direction.",
        "Regarding risks for inflation, some members mentioned to the downside a greater than expected impact of the negative output gap.",
        "As for upside risks, some members pointed out the possibility of additional episodes of foreign exchange depreciation.",
        "One member noted that this could be due to internal and/or external factors.",
        "Some members highlighted the risk of a de-anchoring of inflation expectations.",
        "One member stated that if short-term expectations continue to be revised upwards, they may affect long-term expectations, which remain above the target.",
        "Another member added that an additional deterioration from the supply side cannot be ruled out.",
        "One member considered that there is a risk that upward pressures on food merchandise prices persist and that they are not offset by other price reductions generated by the economic slack.",
        "He/she noted that, likewise, the downward path of inflation in the past year may currently exert upward pressures on prices due to a comparison base effect.",
        "Another member stated that the risks are limited due to: i) the deterioration of aggregate demand is of an unprecedented magnitude and will persist for an undetermined number of quarters; ii) the peso exchange rate has remained relatively stable for almost three consecutive months, and iii) the outlook for financial markets, although still uncertain, is better than during the worst moments of the pandemic.",
        "He/she pointed out that, for all of the above reasons, greater inflationary pressures associated to these factors are not anticipated.",
        "He/she added that, in line with their international references, fuel prices are expected to remain below the level registered at the beginning of the year, which will continue to exert downward pressures on the rest of goods and services prices through their impact on production costs.",
        "In this context, most members agreed that the balance Most members mentioned that financial markets have exhibited a relatively stable behavior as a result of the lower risk aversion worldwide and the measures adopted by Banco de México.",
        "The majority of members highlighted the stability of the peso exchange rate and the reductions in interest rates throughout the entire yield curve.",
        "Some members added that the sovereign risk continued to decrease moderately and the stock market exhibited a slight downward adjustment.",
        "Some members pointed out that foreign investment outflows have diminished.",
        "Nevertheless, some members highlighted that, despite such improvements, financial conditions have still not returned to their normal state.",
        "One member underlined that elements that call for caution persist.",
        "Among these elements, he/she mentioned that trading conditions remain deteriorated; that the negative balance of the net currency position continued to widen; and that outflows in fixed income instruments have accumulated over USD 15 billion so far this year, a figure that stands out among emerging countries.",
        "Another member stated that the peso may be subject to pressures in the following months due to idiosyncratic factors, including Pemex’s situation, this and other challenges for public finances, and their impact on the sovereign credit rating, as well as a difficult external environment characterized, among other risks, by the US election process.",
        "One member mentioned that the country faces a sentiment of risk aversion due to the aforementioned election process, as well as to trade tensions and geopolitical conflicts.",
        "Another member noted that the economic growth outlook is a major determinant of financial markets and thus it is fundamental that it improves so that markets perform more favorably.",
        "One member added that, in a complex environment, a sound and sustainable macroeconomic stance that contributes to an orderly adjustment of financial markets and of the economy overall is required.",
        "The above, in a framework that maintains the sustainability of public finances, a low and stable inflation and a sound and well-capitalized financial system.",
        "Some members pointed out that the situation of public finances is a risk factor.",
        "Some members highlighted that they are expected to deteriorate and that the public debt-to-GDP ratio is anticipated to increase.",
        "One member stated that this would occur due to the shortage of budgetary revenues which, even after taking into account the use of extraordinary resources, such as those from the Budget Revenue Stabilization Fund (FEIP) and oil hedges, may lead Public Sector’s Borrowing Requirements to reach between 5 and 6% of GDP.",
        "Another member added that the main fiscal indicators are anticipated to be more unfavorable than those reported by the authorities in their latest report.",
        "One member emphasized that, in addition to its operational deterioration, the Stateowned company will face large maturities that will probably call for an increased fiscal support.",
        "Thus, some members highlighted the risk of a downgrading of the sovereign and Pemex’s credit rating.",
        "One member pointed out that, according to a recent survey conducted by an investment bank, most investors surveyed estimate that the investment grade would be lost in 2021 or 2022.",
        "He/she highlighted the situation of Pemex and public finances as the main underlying factor.",
        "In this regard, he/she mentioned that the impact of the pandemic now adds up to the previously observed difficulties and that, if timely actions are not adopted, the costs will probably materialize relatively fast, in light of the markets’ tendency to anticipate their reaction to this type of events.",
        "Another member highlighted that the possibility of losing the investment grade has already led to a tightening of financial conditions, and that, if it were to materialize, financing costs would increase even further.",
        "Most members noted that the impact of the pandemic is already being reflected in financing to firms and households.",
        "Some members mentioned that delinquency rates of certain bank and non-bank loan portfolio segments have increased, although one member considered that the measures implemented by Banco de México have contributed to adequately absorb the shock.",
        "Another member mentioned that the real annual growth rate of financing has been decreasing and that in June it was even negative.",
        "He/she added that new credit card loans, car loans and payroll loans have declined sharply and bank credit to small firms decreased by more than 10 billion pesos during the first half of the year.",
        "He/she emphasized the reduction of new loans to firms with less than 100 employees.",
        "He/she also noted that lending conditions are now stricter and that interest rate spreads have increased, especially for small- and medium-sized firms.",
        "Some members pointed out that the proposed pension system reform has positive elements for financial markets and for the Mexican economy in general.",
        "One member considered that the announcement helps to remove a factor of uncertainty, which was weighing on markets and sends the right signal that the reallocation of the government's contribution to lower-income workers will make it possible to increase the perceived and real value of a large number of formal jobs, without increasing firms’ costs.",
        "He/she said that, for this reason, the reform will help to promote labor formality.",
        "environment of public policies is unfavorable for stimulating private investment and that there is no counter-cyclical fiscal policy to support the productive sector.",
        "One member warned that the above not only hinders the economic recovery, but also increases the possibility of long-term damage to productive activities.",
        "He/she pointed out that the consequences for potential growth can be considerable, especially in view of the contraction of investment, which fell additional 32% in the following two months, and the need to implement a set of actions focused on increasing productivity.",
        "Considering the referred risks for inflation, economic activity and financial markets, and considering the room for maneuvering that on balance these provide to monetary policy, most members agreed on decreasing the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 50 basis points to a level of 4.5%.",
        "One member voted to One member stated that monetary policy is facing challenges in two dimensions: the deep economic contraction and its effects on inflation, and the impact of the global financial shock.",
        "He/she added that in order to achieve an orderly adjustment of the economy, as well as low and stable inflation, it is necessary to promote the sound functioning of domestic financial markets, especially the foreign exchange and fixed-income markets, avoiding abrupt portfolio adjustments and capital outflows.",
        "He/she indicated that this offers a greater margin for maneuver, since the financial shock operates on a shorter horizon than the shock to economic activity.",
        "In this context, he/she pointed out that it is necessary to identify the challenges and dilemmas monetary policy faces, by incorporating all available information and considering a wide range of scenarios.",
        "Another member considered it important for monetary policy to continue its easing cycle, without ruling out the possibility of reaching a real interest rate close to zero or even negative.",
        "He/she recalled that in the 2008-2009 financial crisis there was also a real shock and a financial shock, and that despite an increase in expected inflation, which surpassed easing, which brought the real interest rate to negative levels in less than 10 months.",
        "He/she mentioned that the accommodative policy stance was maintained and intensified over the next few years, allowing the economy to recover, while financial markets were favored by the improved economic outlook, which led to an exchange rate appreciation, and there was a sustained decline in inflation expectations.",
        "He/she pointed out that the magnitude of the estimated output gap currently implies that it has been affected twice as much as during 2008-2009.",
        "He/she argued that this reflects the need for a real interest rate which contributes to improve the outlook on the economic recovery in the near future and at the same time remains compatible with price stability.",
        "He/she also considered that the economy would benefit from a less restrictive monetary policy, without implying putting price stability at risk.",
        "He/she pointed out that, on the contrary, monetary easing so far implemented by Banco de México has had a favorable effect on financial markets, given that the exchange rate has recovered lost ground and remained relatively stable over the last quarter.",
        "He/she argued that a lower interest rate would positively affect financing, which for some firms could make the difference between closing and surviving.",
        "He/she pointed out that, although firms’ credit risk has increased, this implies that the risk-free rate should be further reduced to avoid an increase in their financial costs.",
        "He/she said that he/she does not believe that a more accommodative stance could lead to higher inflation or financial instability, but rather may end up being favorable for financial markets as long as it affects the economic outlook positively.",
        "One member highlighted that the issue regarding the end point of the monetary easing cycle has gained relevance, especially in view of the possibility that the rate will remain at that level for a long period.",
        "He/she added that the economic and social crisis demands continuing decisively with the accommodative cycle to stimulate the economy.",
        "Nevertheless, the velocity at which we approach the cycle’s endpoint is key to prevent premature and undesirable monetary policy reversions, which could take place upon the materialization of some of the existing risks.",
        "In that sense, the terminal reference rate and its trajectory will have to continue being determined according to the information provided by the circumstances.",
        "He/she pointed out that it is important to avoid premature and undesirable reversions in monetary policy, which might occur if some of the existing risks materialize.",
        "He/she added that most analysts anticipate the reference rate floor to be between 3% and 4.5%, which suggests that the market expects the easing cycle will not conclude yet.",
        "He/she argued that this is supported by the good performance of inflation, the stability of financial markets, and expectations of a long period in which the economy will remain depressed.",
        "He/she pointed out that the relative monetary policy stance offers certain room for maneuver, but it is more limited due to the risks in international markets.",
        "He/she mentioned that pressures on the Mexican peso and volatility may arise, since the three-month rate spread adjusted for exchange rate volatility is already in the average range of the emerging complex, and given the greater use of the peso as a FX hedge.",
        "He/she added that a lower yield also encourages capital outflows.",
        "He/she pointed out that as for the absolute monetary policy stance, the gap between the neutral and the reference rate, indicates that there is still room to maintain an expansionary policy.",
        "This, as a result of certain downward pressures on the neutral rate generated by structural and circumstantial causes, some of them related to the pandemic.",
        "He/she argued that monetary policy in the short term must counteract the effects of the pandemic on economic activity and employment, but always targeting the stabilization of inflation expectations.",
        "He/she expressed that the most effective defense for lower-income groups is to protect their purchasing power and to mitigate the impact on employment.",
        "He/she emphasized that it is necessary to ensure that inflation remains on a trajectory of convergence to its target and that short-term inflationary pressures yield.",
        "He/she stressed that otherwise it will be necessary to reflect more deeply on the scope and speed of the current downward cycle.",
        "One member argued that the behavior of inflation expectations poses a challenge for the credibility of the inflation target and for monetary policy.",
        "He/she added that this situation could be the result of the economy's exposure to external shocks and the implementation of domestic policies, even in fields different from monetary policy.",
        "He/she indicated that the risks entailing additional interest rate cuts have intensified, due to persistent inflationary pressures and the potential implications of a lower interest rate differential in an economy that is very open to capital flows and with a highly liquid currency in global markets.",
        "Regarding this point, he/she stated that in order to compare the reference rate in Mexico with those of other emerging economies, the rates adjusted for foreign exchange risk must be considered.",
        "He/she argued that in the absence of capital flows that justify it, to determine the reference rate in Mexico according to its level in other emerging economies would be like trying to define the monetary policy of a country based on the inflationary performance of another.",
        "He/she added that the monetary policy stance in Mexico has played a key role in containing increases in long-term interest rates.",
        "He/she stressed that these are lower in Mexico than in several other emerging economies with lower reference rates.",
        "On the other hand, he/she pointed out that lowering the reference rate to a level of 4.5% would place it below the range estimated for the neutral rate, although noting that the latter is most probably being affected upwards by the lower access to external financing and the increased uncertainty, and downwards by the likely decrease in potential growth.",
        "He/she stated that even though under these circumstances it is difficult to make an accurate assessment of the monetary policy stance based on this indicator, available information suggests that it is currently in expansionary territory.",
        "He/she considered that with a reference rate of 4.5%, the margins for additional reductions, if existent at all, would be significantly narrower.",
        "He/she stated that, due to the above, monetary policy must be even more cautious in the following months and, if available information suggests that there is still room for an additional easing, the adjustments should be expected to be more gradual than those observed in recent months.",
        "He/she highlighted that the cautious approach to monetary policy implementation adopted by the Central Bank has worked satisfactorily.",
        "Another member indicated that Banco de México took a proactive role, responding in a timely and decisive way in face of the enormous challenges that the pandemic implied, in order to achieve its goals and its primary objective.",
        "He/she highlighted that in March the pace of monetary easing accelerated.",
        "In this regard he/she highlighted two considerations.",
        "First, given the nature of the shock, the priority was to guarantee liquidity and the well-functioning of markets.",
        "With this aim, extraordinary measures were announced, which had to be accompanied by a faster pace of monetary easing, acknowledging that by itself it would be insufficient to offset the collapse in economic activity.",
        "Second, there was a high degree of uncertainty regarding the evolution of inflation given the presence of factors that were operating in opposite directions.",
        "For such reason, actions were taken cautiously, following a gradual approach, taking into consideration incoming information in a timely way, and guaranteeing the convergence of inflation to its target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates.",
        "Nevertheless, he/she argued that the outlook has changed significantly, with a favorable performance of financial markets and what appears to be an inflection point for economic activity.",
        "In this context, he/she considered that the room for maneuver to continue with monetary easing has diminished given the higher risk that inflation may not converge to its target during the time frame in which monetary policy operates, as well as the greater sensitivity that capital flows to fixed income assets in Mexico have shown relative to other emerging economies.",
        "This, despite maintaining a less relaxed absolute and relative monetary policy stance.",
        "He/she mentioned the need to follow a strategy that allows for an adjustment of monetary policy as more information becomes available, and that the message must be that the Central Bank does not find the trajectory nor the levels of inflation that are being observed acceptable, in order to foster a convergence of inflation expectations to levels consistent with the 3% target.",
        "The majority of members argued that other measures to accompany the extraordinary measures adopted by the Central Bank, such as guarantee programs, are necessary in order for these to work better.",
        "One member mentioned the need to maintain the availability of financing for firms and households, and that Banco de México has adjusted the announced measures and facilities accordingly.",
        "Another member pointed out that Banco de México has adopted a series of measures aimed at providing liquidity and intended to avoid a contraction of credit, and highlighted the guarantee programs implemented by development banks.",
        "He/she indicated that commercial banks must also do their part in order for the facilities announced by the Central Bank to fully achieve their objectives.",
        "He/she added that the soundness of the recovery will depend significantly on what commercial banks do or stop doing and highlighted that they must be part of the solution and not part of the problem.",
        "One member added the need to intensify the implementation and efficacy of Banco de México’s additional measures.",
        "He/she pointed out that the improved functioning of these facilities must be guaranteed, by increasing liquidity and providing more credit at a lower cost.",
        "A more relaxed monetary policy will make the implementation of these measures more effective and also reduce the financial burden of firms.",
        "Another member stated that the weakness of bank credit highlights the need for complementing monetary policy actions as well as the measures to provide financing implemented by Banco de México with credit guarantees for priority sectors.",
        "He/she also pointed out that although the financial system overall maintains a sound position, it is necessary to ensure that financial authorities are able respond adequately to the potential challenges faced.",
        "Taking into account the referred risks for inflation, economic activity and financial markets, major challenges arise for monetary policy and for the economy in general.",
        "Based on the foreseen scenarios, and considering the room for maneuvering that on balance these provide to monetary policy, with the presence of all its members, on this occasion, Banco de México’s Governing Board decided by majority to lower the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 50 basis points to a level of 4.5%.",
        "One member voted for lowering the target to 4.75%.",
        "Looking ahead, the available room for maneuver will depend on the evolution of the factors that have an incidence on the outlook for inflation and its expectations, including the effects that the pandemic might have on both factors.",
        "The Governing Board will take the necessary actions on the basis of incoming information and considering the large impact on productive activity as well as the evolution of the financial shock that we are currently facing, so that the policy rate is consistent with the orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to Banco de México’s target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates.",
        "Perseverance in strengthening the macroeconomic fundamentals and adopting the necessary actions, regarding both monetary and fiscal policies, will contribute to a better adjustment of domestic financial markets and of the economy as a whole.",
        "Alejandro Díaz de León-Carrillo, Gerardo EsquivelHernández, Javier Eduardo Guzmán-Calafell and Jonathan Ernest Heath-Constable voted in favor of lowering the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 50 basis points to a level of 4.5%.",
        "Irene Espinosa-Cantellano voted in favor of lowering the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by Starting in March, we announced measures to provide liquidity and, complementary to these, we also increased the pace of monetary policy loosening to face the shocks generated by the pandemic.",
        "Since then, financial markets have evolved favorably and economic activity appears to have crossed an inflection point.",
        "Inflation, however, continues to persist at levels above the target, it remains to the upside, it has recently exceeded its forecasts, and its expectations have increased.",
        "This behavior, in the midst of the most severe recession historically, suggests the need to reconsider the disinflationary influence attributed to the cyclical component of economic activity.",
        "In addition, despite the relative monetary policy stance, foreign investors’ capital outflows stand out when compared with other emerging economies.",
        "This suggests a lesser room for monetary policy loosening.",
        "Consequently, we must adjust the pace to strengthen the convergence of inflation and its expectations to the 3% target.",
        "Most members of the Governing Board pointed out that during the fourth quarter of the year the world economy continued to decelerate.",
        "In this respect, one member noted that this was the result of the weakness of advanced economies, given that growth in emerging economies remained stable during said period.",
        "Some members added that in 2019 the international environment has been characterized by high uncertainty.",
        "One member mentioned that the extended trade war between the United States and China has been the biggest obstacle to world economic growth.",
        "Some members commented that the impact of trade tensions have propitiated a decline in global trade, investment, manufacturing production and business confidence.",
        "One member mentioned that the strongest impact has been observed in more open economies that export to the U.S. and China.",
        "Most members mentioned that the main advanced economies have continued to slow down.",
        "One of them specified that the US economy is an exception, an economy which is going through its longest cycle of expansion on record.",
        "Another member pointed out that trade-related uncertainty has affected economic activity in the Euro area, Japan and the U.S. He/she mentioned that in the U.S. the weakness of investment stands out, although in general the impact has been of a lesser magnitude.",
        "Meanwhile, some members pointed out that private consumption and services have expanded in advanced economies.",
        "One member highlighted that the services’ sector is the main source of employment and that it has contributed to maintain the unemployment gaps at historically low levels.",
        "In this context, most members considered that these economies’ labor markets have continued to show strength.",
        "As for emerging economies, one member stated that available indicators point to a not so favorable behavior, due to idiosyncratic factors associated to outbreaks of sociopolitical instability, especially in Latin America.",
        "Regarding the growth outlook, most members pointed out that it has been revised downwards.",
        "One member considered that investment is expected to remain weak, given that it tends to be more sensitive to an environment of high uncertainty compared to an environment of low interest rates.",
        "He/she added that looser financial conditions, rather than generating greater capital accumulation, would lead to an increase in businesses and households’ leverage, which could increase financial vulnerabilities, especially in the less regulated segments.",
        "Another member pointed out that in recent weeks, certain timely indicators have started to suggest a possible change of trend.",
        "In this regard, most members agreed that the growth rate of the world economy is anticipated to begin rebounding starting from early 2020.",
        "One member specified that this forecast is based on expectations that, along with the expected stimulus provided by the implemented policy measures, global economic activity will be supported by the gradual fading of the impact of certain factors that have affected it.",
        "He/she added that the economic recovery would be gradual, while another member specified that it would be heterogeneous across regions.",
        "Most members noted that some risks to the global economy have moderated recently, in light of the preliminary trade agreement reached between China and the U.S., and the election results in the United Kingdom.",
        "Similarly, one member mentioned that the additional agreement among the governments of Mexico, the United States and Canada has also contributed to improve the business climate.",
        "Most members stressed that risks to the global economy persist, which are associated to: i) trade tensions; ii) political and geopolitical factors; and, iii) a greaterthan-anticipated deceleration in key economies.",
        "One member mentioned surprises in the monetary field as an additional risk.",
        "Regarding the first of the referred risks, some members considered that in view of the upcoming US electoral process it is difficult to guarantee that the negotiations between the U.S. and China will not suffer any setbacks.",
        "With respect to the second risk, some members noted that, although elections in the U.K. lowered the uncertainty, details are still missing about the United Kingdom’s exit strategy from the European Union.",
        "In this context, most members agreed that the balance of risks for world economic activity remains biased to the downside, although one of them mentioned that given the described events, the balance of risks has improved since the last monetary policy decision, and also from a medium-term perspective.",
        "Most members pointed out that both headline and core inflation in the main advanced economies remain at low levels, below the targets of their respective central banks.",
        "Some members noted that, despite the tightening in labor markets, the impact on wages and inflation has been moderate in said economies.",
        "With respect to emerging economies, some members highlighted that in a considerable number of these, headline inflation is below target.",
        "One member added that in most cases, core inflation continues trending downwards.",
        "Another member mentioned that in some cases, slight price level increases have been observed.",
        "In this regard, he/she emphasized the increase in commodity prices.",
        "Finally, he/she added that the balance of risks to global inflation remains biased to the downside.",
        "All members pointed out that the central banks of the main advanced economies maintained accommodative policy stances.",
        "One member added that certain monetary authorities have urged their respective governments to adopt complementary policies that boost economic growth.",
        "Most members noted that in its December meeting, the US Federal Reserve left the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, and highlighted that such range is appropriate to achieve its goals.",
        "They added that, according to that central bank’s communication, prior to increasing the policy rate, an increase in inflation would have to be observed.",
        "They stated that the median of the projections by the members of the Federal Open Market Committee does not indicate further adjustments for 2020, whereas market expectations anticipate only one additional cut for the next year.",
        "In this respect, one member highlighted that economic analysts do not expect changes either in the federal funds’ rate during 2020.",
        "As to emerging economies, some members stated that a number of central banks continued easing their monetary policies.",
        "One member mentioned that Brazil recently lowered its policy rate by 50 basis points, leading to a total downward adjustment of 200-basis points during the year.",
        "Finally, the majority of members agreed that accommodative monetary policy stances at the global level will continue during the next year.",
        "Most members stated that the recent moderation in some of the abovementioned risks to the global economy, along with signs of stabilization in certain leading indicators have led to a greater risk appetite in international financial markets.",
        "They added that the accommodative monetary policy stances have also contributed to the favorable performance of said markets.",
        "In this regard, one member argued that these have incorporated an environment of low interest rates throughout the yield curve.",
        "Another one pointed out that, although there have been episodes of volatility, these have been temporary and more improvements than setbacks have been observed.",
        "Some members mentioned that stock indices have registered generalized gains, reaching historic highs.",
        "Regarding fixed income instruments, some members stated that government bond interest rates declined.",
        "One stressed that around 30% of all fixed income instruments in circulation in developed economies exhibit negative returns, especially in the Euro area and Japan.",
        "He/she pointed out that the US Treasury bonds’ yield curve exhibited a slightly positive slope.",
        "With respect to emerging economies, some mentioned that financial assets exhibited volatility, especially in Latin America as a result of idiosyncratic factors.",
        "In this context, one mentioned that the aforementioned region had a negative performance in the foreign exchange and bond markets.",
        "He/she specified that in the case of emerging economies the results were mixed.",
        "He/she underlined that although flows to fixed income assets were negative in the last four weeks, equity assets registered moderate inflows in said period.",
        "Some members pointed out that the improvement in international financial markets has benefitted emerging economies.",
        "One member emphasized that the flows of funds to these economies have continued to accumulate during the year and that in most cases risk premia have declined.",
        "In this regard, he/she considered that the balance of risks for financial markets has improved since the last monetary policy decision, as well as from a medium-term perspective.",
        "Another member warned that, although the observed improvement suggests a more favorable global environment, a sudden tightening stemming from the materialization of certain risks cannot be ruled out.",
        "All members mentioned that although information available for the fourth quarter of 2019 is limited, the weakness that has been observed for several quarters in Mexico’s economic activity is expected to persist, and they agreed that the economy remains stagnant.",
        "One member pointed out that an accurate reading of economic activity is complicated not only because of the limited information available, but also due to the effects of the temporary factors that have affected the automotive sector.",
        "Another member added that the stagnation has been due to: i) an external environment that has not been favorable, given that US manufacturing production contracted during the last year; ii) that at the beginning of each new administration’s six-year term a deceleration is observed associated with slow public spending; and, iii) a tight monetary policy that has affected consumption and investment.",
        "He/she considered that the latter is particularly relevant in an environment in which the real yield of government bonds is even above the expected real rate of return of many productive investment projects.",
        "Regarding aggregate demand, one member mentioned that the weakness of its components persists.",
        "Some members underlined the deceleration of consumption and the negative trend in investment.",
        "One member emphasized that public investment continues to reflect the lack of resources and that private investment has been affected for a number of years by the uncertainty regarding the trade relations in North America and by other domestic factors.",
        "He/she added that the weakness of investment in machinery and equipment and in construction has intensified.",
        "He/she also specified that non-residential investment has maintained a declining trend since early 2015.",
        "With regards to external demand, most members pointed out that manufacturing exports lost dynamism, and that they were affected by strikes in the US automotive sector, although one member considered that exports maintained a positive trend.",
        "On the supply side, most members underlined the negative performance of the industrial sector.",
        "Some members detailed that in October it contracted once again.",
        "One member added that this confirmed the negative trend that this indicator has been exhibiting.",
        "Within industrial production, most members highlighted the loss of dynamism in manufacturing production as well as the weakness in mining and construction.",
        "Regarding manufacturing production, one member specified that in October it registered a significant fall, although it is expected to be transitory.",
        "Regarding construction, most members stressed that its decline intensified during the year.",
        "One member detailed that mining seems to have started to stabilize after having exhibited a negative trend for several years.",
        "Finally, another member added that the services sector continues to decelerate.",
        "As to the labor market, most members highlighted the decrease in the growth rate of formal employment.",
        "One member specified that in November 2019, 345 thousand formal jobs were created, with an annual growth of 1.7%, figures below those of the previous year, of 688 thousand jobs and a 3.5% growth.",
        "One member mentioned that during 2019 formal job creation is expected to register its lowest level since 2009.",
        "He/she also emphasized the higher employment in the informal sector and an increase in underemployment.",
        "He/she mentioned that the accumulated change since 2012 of the percentage of economically active population that works less than 35 hours a week increased by a factor of almost four during the period 2018-2019.",
        "One member added that a slight increase in the unemployment rate was also observed.",
        "Some members considered that the evolution of the labor market has reflected the weakness of the economy, although some of them maintained that it has also reflected the trajectory of wages.",
        "In particular, one member mentioned that there is information which suggests that the wage policy has started to limit formal job creation, which may also weaken economic activity.",
        "He/she specified that such distortions will become more evident as a result of the 20% increase in the minimum wage starting years.",
        "Another member added that the experience of the northern border free zone clearly shows that wage increases that are inconsistent with the development of productivity negatively affect employment.",
        "He/she added that the upward trend in unit labor costs has continued, as a consequence of both larger real remunerations and a labor productivity that has registered consecutive annual contractions over the last 6 quarters.",
        "Most members agreed that the stagnation of economic activity has implied that the negative slack conditions have widened with respect to those observed in the previous quarter.",
        "One member noted that such widening has been greater than previously foreseen.",
        "Another member considered that its magnitude is a reason for concern and estimated that the current negative output gap is by far the largest since the 2009 global crisis.",
        "Another member noted that the growth outlook for 2019 and 2020 imply negative output gaps in both years similar to those estimated in the latest Quarterly Report.",
        "One member specified that given the economy’s cyclical position, exogenous cost pressures, salary pressures among them, could hamper the recovery of employment and production as well as the narrowing of the negative output gap.",
        "Most members mentioned that the growth outlook is in line with that published in the Quarterly Report July recovery is expected.",
        "One member mentioned that the recovery is possible for several reasons: i) a low comparison base; ii) the public administration is more prepared to operate; iii) the USMCA ratification is imminent; and, iv) a low probability that the negative shocks observed in 2019 occur again.",
        "Some members maintained that a slight recovery of private consumption is estimated, boosted by consumer confidence, income from remittances, and the wage bill.",
        "One member expressed that investment is foreseen to remain weak, both in construction and in imported machinery and equipment.",
        "He/she added that a slight recovery in tertiary activities is anticipated.",
        "However, he/she stated that industrial production would maintain an unfavorable evolution, particularly in construction and mining.",
        "Most members noted that in an environment of marked uncertainty the balance of risks for growth remains biased to the downside.",
        "One considered that said balance has been deteriorating throughout the year, and another member pointed out that this has occurred despite a certain improvement in the environment.",
        "Some members maintained that the growth remains subject to both external and domestic risks.",
        "In addition to the above described global risks, one member added expectations of a slight improvement in the global economy as an upside risk.",
        "He/she considered that among domestic risks the possibility of monetary policy remaining tight for a long period stands out.",
        "Most members mentioned that there are risks associated to the ratification of the USMCA in the U.S. and Canada.",
        "Some members warned that the final part of the legislative ratification is still pending in said countries.",
        "However, most members acknowledged that the uncertainty associated to such process has diminished and agreed that the USMCA ratification could improve the investment outlook.",
        "Nonetheless, one member noted that non trivial challenges to its implementation are anticipated, and therefore it is not evident that said agreement will reactivate private investment in the short run.",
        "In this context, another member mentioned that this agreement is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for a strengthening of confidence that is compatible with a solid expansion of investment.",
        "Most members stressed that to reach this goal, other domestic uncertainty factors need to be mitigated, such as those related to governance, legal certainty, insecurity and those related to the country’ economic and political situation.",
        "One member asserted that the implications of the behavior of investment in recent years for potential growth are even more worrisome, a situation that is accentuated considering the level, orientation and high concentration of public investment, as well as the possibility that the recent stagnation of total factor productivity persists or even that a negative trend in this variable is observed, in the absence of a public policy package that may contribute to reverse such trend.",
        "Meanwhile, another member added that it is unlikely that the National Infrastructure Investment Agreement of the Private Sector could reverse the weakness of investment, given that the resources intended for these projects are lower than the annual average observed in the last five years.",
        "He/she added that the restructuring of spending approved in the 2020 Federal Budget poses significant risks to the country’s potential growth, given that resources are reallocated from strategic sectors, such as the electrical sector, the airport sector, and the highway infrastructure sector, to projects with uncertain profitability.",
        "Another member mentioned the possible reductions in public revenue as an additional risk to growth.",
        "Among upward risks to growth, one member stated that the foundations of private consumption, such as remittances, the real wage bill and consumer confidence remain strong.",
        "He/she also noted that the fiscal policy objective will be a lower surplus, which will allow for a higher public spending.",
        "He/she mentioned that the factors that typically tend to cause a deceleration at the beginning of each new government’s six-year term will no longer be present and stated that the National Infrastructure and Housing Programs will start functioning next year.",
        "Similarly, some members pointed out that it is possible that a less restrictive monetary policy contributes to a recovery of the economy.",
        "One of them mentioned that investment and consumption would gradually recover.",
        "Most members stated that in November headline inflation was 2.97%, lying around the point target.",
        "One member mentioned that headline inflation has decreased at a greater-than-anticipated rate.",
        "Most members stressed that the decline in headline inflation was determined by a significant reduction in the non-core component.",
        "In this regard, all noted that the annual rate of change of this component was particularly low, reaching 0.98% in November.",
        "On the other hand, most members mentioned that core inflation exhibited slight reductions, laying at 3.65%, a pattern that one member emphasized has been observed since early 2018.",
        "Delving into the evolution of non-core inflation, all members considered that it has remained at historically low levels.",
        "In this regard, most members highlighted the reduction in the rates of change of energy prices and agricultural and livestock products’ prices.",
        "As to core inflation, most members emphasized that it has exhibited persistence.",
        "One member pointed out that it has declined at a rate lower than expected at the beginning of the year.",
        "Another member considered that it has remained on the same decreasing trend observed since June of this year.",
        "Some members attributed the slow reduction of core inflation to the high rates of change of services’ prices.",
        "One member underlined that throughout the year, the price-related pressures of the services other than housing and food merchandise have been associated, in his/her opinion, to the indirect effects of the energy price increases in 2018 and to the wage increases since early 2019.",
        "Meanwhile, another member considered that the different determinants of core inflation have performed favorably during the year.",
        "Specifically, he/she mentioned the exchange rate appreciation, the low levels of inflation of energy and agricultural and livestock products’ prices, along with a negative output gap.",
        "The majority of members pointed out that short-term inflation expectations have moderated, while those for the longer term remain above 3%.",
        "One member noted that expectations for headline inflation for the end of 2019 decreased from 3.00 to 2.94% and those for 2020 rose slightly from 3.46 to 3.5%.",
        "Another member noted that, based on the latest information and prior to the decision on minimum wages, expectations for headline and core inflation for 2020 and for the long term were 3.5 and 3.4%, respectively.",
        "He/she added that such expectations could partially incorporate the said adjustment to the minimum wage, but that it will be necessary to wait for the next surveys to determine if they show an additional adjustment.",
        "One member mentioned that short-term inflation expectations from surveys have followed the latest information and that breakeven inflation and inflationary risk implied in fixed income instruments has remained relatively stable.",
        "As for inflation forecasts, most members estimated that headline inflation expectations for the end of Report July-September 2019.",
        "One member mentioned that he/she foresees that it will close below target, and be the second lowest annual inflation of the current century.",
        "In this regard, the majority stated that this behavior would respond to the outstandingly favorable performance of non-core inflation during 2019.",
        "Some members emphasized that such performance is not expected to continue much longer.",
        "One member pointed out that, with an average of almost 6% since January 2001, when the inflation targeting regime was formally adopted, it would be difficult to expect that non-core inflation continues registering such low figures for a long time.",
        "In this regard, he/she considered that, in said context, assessing the behavior of inflation based on the headline price index entails serious limitations.",
        "Another member argued that it is wrong to assume that non-core inflation will once again show its previous levels and volatility since the new policy on energy prices reduces the volatility of this component by design.",
        "He/she pointed out that, given this policy, it is not right to assume that non-core inflation will mechanically rebound and that this assumption led to overestimations of headline inflation in 2019.",
        "He/she added that such was the case of estimates by economic forecasters and by Banco de México itself, which, in May of this year adjusted upwards its inflation estimates for the fourth quarter of 2019, from forecasters had estimated inflation to be at 3.66% for the end of 2019.",
        "He/she mentioned that these estimates contrast significantly with the figure estimated for the end of the year.",
        "Regarding the core inflation outlook, some members stated that it is expected to continue declining in December, although one member pointed out that doubts persist as to the pace at which it would decrease.",
        "For 2020, the majority of members considered that headline and core inflation will reflect both the conditions of greater slack in the economy as well as the cost pressures that could stem from the minimum wage increase, which could raise them to moderately higher levels than those anticipated in the last Quarterly Report.",
        "One member stated that although it is difficult to anticipate which would be the end result of the interaction between the aforementioned factors, since it is uncommon for the economy to face labor cost pressures during the low phase of the economic cycle, core inflation is expected to be subject to moderate pressures.",
        "Some members pointed out that with the announced minimum wage increase, one of the upward risks for inflation materialized, which will make it difficult to attain the underlined that a transitory seasonal rebound in inflation in the following months is expected.",
        "Another member considered that several determinants that have a delayed impact on core inflation have had a favorable behavior during the year, and, thus, this component is foreseen to continue decreasing in the following months and headline inflation to continue at levels close to the target in the next year.",
        "As for upward risks to inflation, most members mentioned the possibility of core inflation continuing to show persistence and that the recent minimum wage increase leads to wage revisions that exceed productivity gains in different segments of the employed population and that this generates costrelated pressures, affecting formal employment and prices.",
        "In this regard, such members argued that the effect on inflation of the minimum wage increase is expected to be moderate.",
        "One member noted that research on the lighthouse effect of the minimum wage concludes that the impact should be marginal.",
        "Another member stated that it is not clear that minimum wage increases significantly affect inflation and that evidence on the minimum wage increase in the border area this year confirms it.",
        "He/she explained that inflation in the northern region in 2019 is the lowest in the country - 2.24% in November – and that it is even lower in the border area, despite the fact that the minimum wage in nominal terms in this region doubled in 2019.",
        "He/she added that something similar can be said about the rest of the country where, despite the increase of over 16% in the minimum wage, observed inflation in 2019 will be significantly below the target.",
        "He/she noted that a wage increase may not be inflationary because: i) it affects a relatively small segment of workers and the wage bill, and ii) domestic labor markets probably operate with distortions that have generated a gap between wage and labor productivity, so that such increases can be absorbed through adjustments in profit margins.",
        "He/she pointed out that the wage increase represents a negative supply shock, whose possible impact on prices is, in any case, transitory, and that the optimal response is not to tighten monetary conditions that would worsen the negative effect of the shock.",
        "Another member noted that wage increases should be supported by productivity gains, otherwise inflationary risks intensify with the introduction of distortions in the price formation processes and formal employment is negatively affected.",
        "He/she added that, given the magnitude of the wage increase, it is foreseeable that a significant number of micro and small enterprises, which group the largest number of workers earning the minimum wage, will have to pass-through such adjustments to the prices of their products, cut their number of employees, or, in the worst case, abandon formality.",
        "He/she noted that the recent announcement would represent the second considerable and consecutive increase to the minimum wage and that it is a factor to which the central bank should remain attentive.",
        "Most members added as an upward risk to inflation that that the peso exchange rate comes under pressure from external or domestic factors, although the easing of certain external tensions and progress in the ratification of the USMCA have reduced this risk.",
        "One member argued that a possible rebound in the exchange rate does not represent a great risk because the peso has appreciated and multiple studies have shown that the pass-through of foreign exchange adjustments to prices is not significant in economies with a flexible exchange rate, a prudent fiscal policy and a central bank with high credibility.",
        "He/she also mentioned that given the risk of exchange rate pressures, monetary policy must not strengthen such variable as a factor to contain inflation, because doing so weakens its function as a variable to prevent imbalances in the balance of payments.",
        "The majority added the threat of tariffs by the United States and the adoption of compensatory measures, although this risk has diminished more noticeably after a new trade agreement was reached.",
        "In this regard, one member emphasized, that even if the ratification of the USMCA is achieved next year, it should not be forgotten that this agreement does not oblige the US Executive to refrain from establishing tariffs or other unilateral trade restrictions, which could represent new price shocks.",
        "In addition, most members mentioned the risks of public finances deteriorating or of increases in agricultural, livestock product or energy prices being greater than expected, which could make non-core inflation revert to higher levels.",
        "One member highlighted that, although energy prices are administered by the government and do not automatically reflect the evolution of their international references, increases in the latter generate pressures on public finances, which indirectly impact the dynamics of domestic prices through different channels.",
        "Finally, one member added the possibility that a temporary seasonal rebound in inflation in the coming months shows a greater persistence and that economic slack continues to have no clear impact on inflation.",
        "As for downside risks, most members mentioned: i) a greater appreciation of the peso exchange rate, which could be associated with a context of greater risk appetite in international financial markets or with the final steps towards ratifying the trade agreement with the United States and Canada; ii) a widening of slack conditions or their impact on core inflation being greater than foreseen; and iii) that the prices of certain goods included in the non-core subindex register lower rates of change.",
        "One member added a lower pass-through of the minimum wage increase to prices, given the expected slack conditions, and that the favorable behavior of producer prices leads to a decline of the core component.",
        "He/she pointed out that the producer price inflation is close to zero and that several studies indicate a correspondence with consumer prices after a certain lag.",
        "In this context, the majority pointed out that uncertainty still persists as to the risks that could make inflation deviate from the trajectory described previously.",
        "One member noted that this balance of risks applies to an inflation trajectory adjusted upwards as a result of the materialization of one of its risks.",
        "Another stated that, in his/her opinion, the balance is uncertain for the long term and symmetrical in the short term.",
        "One member mentioned that the referred balance has become slightly upward-biased.",
        "Another member considered that inflation risks have decreased significantly during the year.",
        "He/she mentioned that not only the external environment is much more favorable, but that the domestic factors that generated more uncertainty have been resolved favorably.",
        "Most members agreed that, although domestic financial markets underwent episodes of volatility associated with social developments in some Latin American countries, financial assets in Mexico and the peso exchange rate recently exhibited a positive behavior.",
        "Some members pointed out that the agreement to approve the USMCA together with the monetary policy stance have contributed to such results.",
        "The majority mentioned that long-term interest rates decreased.",
        "One member added that real interest rates have also decreased.",
        "He/she argued that, given the complex environment, the sound macroeconomic and monetary policy stances have been fundamental in making the nominal and real yield curves, especially in their longer maturities, adjust downwards in an orderly manner.",
        "He/she noted that both short-term interest rate expectations and term premia have decreased in recent months.",
        "The majority of members noted that the Mexican peso appreciated, although some members stressed that episodes of volatility were observed.",
        "One member highlighted that the Mexican peso performed better than other Latin American currencies, some of which have been more exposed to political and social risks, either directly or by contagion.",
        "Another member emphasized that the stock market registered gains, accumulating a positive annual return close to 6.5%.",
        "As for risk premia, some members underlined the reduction in the CDS premium.",
        "One member argued that, despite such reduction, the level of the premium implies that the market continues discounting a downgrade of the sovereign rating.",
        "Some members mentioned that, despite the favorable evolution of the external environment, risks persist that may affect the performance of domestic financial assets.",
        "As for external risks, they highlighted the possibility of shocks, including for instance, the contagion from emerging economies, mainly from Latin America, or those associated with the electoral process in the United States.",
        "As for domestic risks, they mentioned the uncertainty about Pemex's credit rating.",
        "One member pointed out that significant challenges persist that are still pending solution.",
        "He/she underlined the potential implication, both for public finances and the sovereign credit rating, of the loss of Pemex’s investment grade, while another mentioned that expectations of a downgrade are still latent.",
        "One member argued that the balance of risks for financial markets has improved throughout the year, due to a more favorable external environment and to the resolution of domestic uncertainty factors.",
        "He/she noted that, in that period, interest rates for terms greater than three years decreased around 200 basis points, the peso appreciated around 4%, and Mexico's CDS decreased 75 basis points.",
        "He/she stressed that fiscal discipline was maintained throughout the year, a preliminary trade agreement was reached with the US Congress, and Pemex's rating has been maintained.",
        "As to the latter, he/she pointed out that Pemex’s CDS premium has decreased significantly due to the support of the Federal Government, the refinancing and debt repurchase operations, and the increase in crude oil production.",
        "The majority of members mentioned that the current environment continues to pose risks that may affect the country’s macroeconomic conditions, its ability to grow, and the economy’s price formation process.",
        "In this regard, they highlighted that it is particularly important that, in addition to a prudent and firm monetary policy, measures to foster an environment of confidence and certainty for investment and higher productivity are adopted, and that public finances are consolidated in a sustainable way.",
        "In this context, they stated that strengthening the credit rating outlook for the sovereign and Pemex’s debt, as well as achieving the fiscal targets for 2019 and the goals set in the 2020 Economic Package are necessary.",
        "They also pointed out that strengthening the rule of law, tackling corruption, and fighting insecurity are equally imperative.",
        "One member added that increasing productivity through the adoption of new technologies and human capital investment is also important.",
        "Another member underlined that all these measures would prevent a further deterioration of potential growth.",
        "One member highlighted that, based on the opinion of business owners and economic forecasters, among the obstacles to economic activity in Mexico, the factors related to governance problems (public insecurity, political instability, impunity and corruption) and uncertainty in domestic economic conditions stand out.",
        "In this regard, another member stated that the main action that could be taken to stimulate economic activity is the implementation of public policy measures that generate economic certainty and encourage investment.",
        "Delving into Pemex's financial situation, one member pointed out that one rating agency, whose position will be crucial in defining the future of Pemex's investment grade, has reiterated the negative outlook on the company's rating, based on the one corresponding to the sovereign debt, the deterioration of Pemex's credit profile, and its perception that Pemex's investment expenditures will be insufficient to replenish its crude oil reserves in attention remains focused on validating the company's capacity to increase its production, and that its continuing dependence on the Federal Government’s budget support is unsustainable.",
        "Regarding public finances, some members highlighted that the goals for 2020 are based on optimistic assumptions and that considering the use of resources from the Budget Revenue Stabilization Fund (FEIP, for its acronym in Spanish) this year, the funds to deal with contingencies will be reduced considerably.",
        "One member added that the primary surplus has been achieved through underspending and through the use of resources from the FEIP.",
        "He/she stated that using extraordinary resources to face income shortfalls in the absence of unforeseen shocks does not address the structural problems.",
        "He/she added that fiscal pressures are expected to continue increasing due to the upward trend in pension spending by the Federal Government.",
        "Another member stressed that, at the beginning of the year, there were fears about the Federal Government not complying with fiscal discipline; however, to date, results show that fiscal discipline was maintained.",
        "One member warned that challenges for public finances over the medium and long terms should be considered and that, in this context, the announcement that the tax authorities are considering a tax reform is of great relevance.",
        "Regarding the monetary policy decision, considering the lower levels registered by headline inflation, its outlook within the timeframe in which monetary policy operates, the more ample slack in the economy, as well as the recent behavior of external and domestic yield curves, Banco de México’s Governing Board decided by majority to lower the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 25 basis points to Similarly, one member added two other reasons for lowering the policy rate: i) that the monetary signal and its effect on the cost of financing must be consistent with a real rate of return, which is following a downward trend due to the economy’s cyclical conditions and that maintaining a disparity between these rates for a long period would generate distortions in investment decisions; and, ii) that a monetary policy easing would contribute, albeit modestly, to an economic recovery for the following year.",
        "The same member elaborated on the importance of the relative and absolute monetary policy stances given that they summarize the multiple factors that must be considered in the monetary policy decision.",
        "He/she mentioned that the former is essential in the case of small and open economies, as it reflects the degree of tightness in terms of the global monetary conditions and of the differences between domestic and external inflation.",
        "He/she added that, from a risk appetite perspective, such stance also measures if the level of relative tightness allows to compensate investors for risk premia.",
        "He/she expressed that accommodative monetary policies worldwide, in particular that of the Federal Reserve, and the increase in risk appetite, provide a margin of maneuver for Mexico’s relative monetary policy.",
        "As to the absolute monetary policy stance, said member explained that it considers the inflation target and the neutral rate.",
        "When the level of monetary tightness is compared in these terms, the conditions of the economy’s real rate vis-à-vis its equilibrium level are implicitly assessed.",
        "Furthermore, leaving the policy rate in the restrictive segment, above the neutral rate, as the current absolute policy stance suggests, communicates to society the firm intention of consistently attaining the inflation target.",
        "In sum, the relative and absolute policy stances allow to calibrate the direction and magnitude of the adjustments in the policy rate.",
        "Moreover, their assessment suggests that the monetary policy stance is tighter than necessary.",
        "Therefore, if the expected convergence of inflation to its target is confirmed, the same member mentioned that a greater monetary policy easing might be considered.",
        "Said member argued that the possibility of inflation being above the foreseen trajectory would affect Banco de México’s credibility, which reaffirms the need for gradually adjusting the policy rate within the restrictive range.",
        "In this regard, he/she stated that the speed of these adjustments should consider its effect on the expectations of economic agents.",
        "He/she mentioned that firms and analysts make conjectures about future monetary policy actions, which affect their inflation expectations.",
        "In determining the speed of adjustment, Banco de México must minimize the costs to its credibility in case that inflation deviates from the anticipated trajectory.",
        "He pointed out that, in the context of a weak economy with a materialization of negative risks, a greater than necessary monetary policy easing would imply a higher cost for the central bank’s credibility and the formation of inflation expectations, as compared to a lower than necessary easing.",
        "He/she emphasized that, in this case, a conservative behavior strengthens the perception of commitment to the inflation target, and to the central bank’s independence, in addition to highlighting that Banco de México’s decisions are based on an objective view and supported by technical elements.",
        "He added that an advantage associated with a cautious monetary policy is that it moderates financial market expectations about the actions of the central bank, and allows an orderly evolution of interest rates with lower costs for the economy.",
        "Finally, the same member suggested that the fact that monetary policy is in a rate-cutting cycle that is subject to the evolution of inflation, its expectations and balance of risks, be included in the guidance of the monetary policy statement.",
        "He/she considered that this would acknowledge that the policy rate has been lowered on four consecutive occasions and that the expected trajectory of inflation has been better than anticipated under multiple scenarios.",
        "Including the above into the statement would convey a clearer and more credible message, which would be in line with maintaining a restrictive policy stance in absolute and relative terms for as long as necessary, but not as restrictive as the current one.",
        "One member considered that a 25-basis point adjustment to the policy rate is insufficient to acknowledge the progress attained in the macroeconomic realm and in mitigating risks in the last months, and that this would mean remaining behind the curve already anticipated by the market.",
        "In particular, he/she made reference to inflation being below target, the exchange rate being at levels below conducted prudently.",
        "The same member added that all of the aforementioned has taken place in a context of null growth.",
        "He/she stated that previous communications have mentioned that monetary policy decisions will be taken based on available data and considered that the current conditions allow for a greater monetary policy adjustment.",
        "He/she added that this is possibly the last opportunity to make an adjustment of a greater magnitude.",
        "The same member mentioned that monetary policy must contribute to improve the overall economy’s performance, and that this does not imply putting at risk the central bank’s main mandate.",
        "He/she mentioned that not doing it this way would be unwise and unjustified.",
        "The same member pointed out that the tight monetary policy has affected consumption and investment, in an environment in which the real yield of government bonds is above the expected real rate of return of many productive investment projects.",
        "He/she indicated that a too-high interest rate incentivizes savings by increasing the yield of bonds and also raises the cost of credit.",
        "That both channels hamper consumption and investment and, therefore, growth.",
        "Also, that a high interest rate affects public finances directly by increasing the public debt’s financial cost and indirectly through its negative effect on growth and tax collection.",
        "He/she mentioned that the deterioration of public finances and the lower growth generated by the high interest rates tend to increase delinquency rates and make public debt less attractive, which leads to higher risk premia.",
        "Said member indicated that, for this reason, a too-high interest rate, which in principle seeks to shield us from some risks, might paradoxically become a destabilizing factor.",
        "The majority of members pointed out that given the outlook of high uncertainty that still prevails, maintaining a prudent monetary policy is necessary.",
        "Such members mentioned that monetary policy must be adjusted gradually and mainly respond to the evolution of inflation relative to its foreseen trajectory, and incorporate all information available on the economy’s current situation and characteristics, in such a way as to allow headline inflation to converge to its target in an orderly and sustained manner.",
        "They added that significant domestic and external risks prevail.",
        "Such members were also concerned about medium- and long-term inflation expectations remaining above the 3% target.",
        "One member considered that since the last policy decision, monetary policy faces a more complex situation, given that the current environment is characterized by factors that have differentiated effects on inflation.",
        "On the one hand, slack conditions have widened and the balance of risks for growth is biased to the downside, while headline inflation is at target; and, on the other hand, the risk of a greater than expected increase to the minimum wage materialized.",
        "Another member mentioned that, on this occasion, two additional factors had to be considered.",
        "First, a lesser uncertainty stemming from external factors such as the USMCA.",
        "Said member pointed out that the latter shows how strengthening confidence can increase the margin of maneuver for monetary policy.",
        "He/she added that this highlights the importance of dissipating the domestic sources of concern, due to both their direct impact on the economy and the fact that it would allow a more flexible implementation of the different economic policy instruments.",
        "In this regard, he/she pointed out that monetary policy’s capacity to respond will be very limited if domestic uncertainty does not decrease significantly.",
        "Second, he/she highlighted the outlook of an upward adjustment in the trajectory of inflation, a risk that has materialized via wages and that apparently is the core component’s main source of persistence.",
        "Another member mentioned that the process of monetary policy easing is determined period after period depending on the trajectory of headline inflation and its components towards the target.",
        "In particular, the assessment must take into consideration the following factors: the possible rebound of inflation due to the core component’s persistence; the potential reversion of the non-core component; the probable rebound of the economy in risks.",
        "One member pointed out that the risks faced by the economy are not only those derived from its cyclical position.",
        "There are other challenges and risk factors, external and domestic, which affect the economy, the price formation process, and inflation.",
        "He/she mentioned that the setting of the monetary policy stance must not only foster that the projections for headline inflation remain around the target within the forecast horizon, but also take into consideration: i) an external environment characterized by low growth, with obstacles to investment, and low inflationary pressures and interest rates, and, at the margin, by a greater risk appetite; ii) a considerable widening of slack conditions in the economy; iii) the recent decline of headline inflation as a result of noncore inflation being atypically low; iv) core inflation’s resistance to decline and whose behavior will be determined by the combination of a greater amount of slack in the economy and the direct and indirect effects generated by the minimum wage increase; and, v) the need to foster appropriate conditions in the fixed income market and in short-term interest rates.",
        "As to the latter consideration he/she mentioned that the behavior of interest rates must ensure an orderly adjustment of the economy; be in line with the behavior of the domestic and external yield curve, and with risk premia; maintain the attractiveness of domestic fixed income markets, generate confidence and consider global monetary conditions; and, propitiate that the yield curve incorporates short-term interest rate expectations that are consistent with the central bank’s objectives in the timeframe in which monetary policy operates.",
        "He/she emphasized that the latter suggests the convenience of adjusting the monetary policy stance gradually under the current environment.",
        "He/she added that in this process it is necessary to identify, in the best possible way, the economy’s conditions, the risks it faces, as well as the possible vulnerabilities that could materialize.",
        "Another member mentioned that a monetary policy easing of more than 25 basis points would not be convenient, as it would probably validate the inflationary impact of the minimum wage adjustments, which would justify having long-term inflation expectations above the target.",
        "He/she added that an action of this sort with a view to stimulate economic growth, would be difficult to reconcile with the theoretical and empirical evidence of economic growth determinants, and does not consider the opinion of business people or analysts on the factors that are hampering the growth of the Mexican economy.",
        "It would also leave aside evidence on interest rates having a modest impact on economic growth, even in the short term.",
        "For all of the above reasons, an action like the one described would certainly be perceived as being incompatible with the central bank’s mandate.",
        "He/she added that monetary policy must strive for the convergence of inflation to its target without imposing excessive costs to the economy while, at the same time, preventing inflation expectations from becoming unanchored.",
        "He/she mentioned that the argument that Banco de México must adjust its monetary policy stance in view of a wide nominal interest rate spread with other economies, does not consider the need for including other risk factors into the analysis, such as the exchange rate volatility.",
        "Once the latter is considered, the spread decreases significantly.",
        "Another member highlighted that the monetary policy statement must continue to communicate that in an environment characterized by high risks and great uncertainty, future monetary policy will depend mainly on the evolution of inflation and on its deviations from the foreseen trajectory.",
        "To guide its monetary policy actions, Banco de México’s Governing Board follows closely the development of inflation vis-à-vis its forecasts, taking into account the monetary policy stance and the time frame in which monetary policy operates.",
        "In this process, it uses available information on all inflation determinants as well as on medium- and long-term inflation expectations, including the balance of risks for such factors.",
        "Monetary policy must also act prudently if for any reason the uncertainty faced by the economy increases significantly.",
        "In this context, considering the lower levels registered by headline inflation, its outlook within the time frame in which monetary policy operates, the more ample slack in the economy, as well as the recent behavior of external and domestic yield curves, Banco de México’s Governing Board decided by majority to lower the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 25 basis points to 7.25%.",
        "One member voted for lowering the target to 7.00%.",
        "In order to consolidate a low and stable inflation, in an environment in which price formation and slack conditions in the economy are subject to risks, the Governing Board will continue to follow closely all factors and elements of uncertainty that have an impact on inflation and its outlook, and will take the required actions based on incoming information so that the policy rate is consistent with the orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to Banco de México’s target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates.",
        "Banco de México’s Governing Board will maintain a prudent monetary policy stance and, under the current environment of uncertainty, will follow closely the potential pass-through of exchange rate fluctuations to prices, Mexico’s relative monetary policy stance in an external environment that it is still subject to risks, and the behavior of slack conditions and cost-related pressures in the economy.",
        "In the presence and possible persistence of factors that, by their nature, involve risks to both inflation and its expectations, monetary policy will be adjusted in a timely and firm manner to achieve an orderly and sustained convergence of inflation to its 3% target and to strengthen the anchoring of medium- and long-term inflation expectations so that they attain such target.",
        "Alejandro Díaz de León-Carrillo, Irene EspinosaCantellano, Javier Eduardo Guzmán-Calafell, and Jonathan Ernest Heath-Constable voted in favor of lowering the overnight interbank interest rate by 25 basis points to a level of 7.25%.",
        "Gerardo Esquivel-Hernández voted in favor of lowering the overnight interbank interest rate by 50 basis points to a level of 7.00%.",
        "Gerardo Esquivel-Hernández I believe that the economic juncture in which the decision was taken was probably one of the last favorable opportunities in this cycle to make a more decisive monetary policy adjustment.",
        "In my opinion, lowering the policy rate by only 25 basis points is insufficient to acknowledge the progress attained in reducing inflation and in mitigating inflationary risks over the last months.",
        "An adjustment of this magnitude simply means remaining behind the curve already anticipated by the market.",
        "On numerous occasions it has been said that monetary policy decisions will be taken based on facts and observed figures.",
        "I believe that the combination of an exchange rate close to 19 pesos per US dollar, an annual inflation below target, the significant reduction of external and domestic risks, and null economic growth could fully justify opting for a more decisive policy action.",
        "The alleged inflationary risk attributed to the minimum wage is in fact very low.",
        "This year’s evidence, both in the northern border as well as in the rest of the country, suggests it.",
        "Overestimating this risk may end up influencing inflation expectations and becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy.",
        "All members mentioned that the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures adopted to prevent its spread have affected world economic activity considerably.",
        "Some members added that these have had an important impact on employment.",
        "One member emphasized the repercussions on manufactures, on processes integrated into global value chains, and person-to-person services.",
        "He/she pointed out that the damage has been immediate and abrupt, both to supply and demand.",
        "Some members stated that sanitary measures have proven to be somewhat effective in reducing contagion, with differentiated results across jurisdictions.",
        "In this context, they noted that the main advanced economies started reopening their activities.",
        "One member stressed that Latin America has become the epicenter of the crisis, given that, among other factors, the high degree of informality and poverty hinder compliance of social distancing measures.",
        "Most members stated that the contraction of economic activity observed during the first quarter intensified during the second, although in May certain indicators for various economies exhibited some improvement.",
        "One member expressed that the deterioration during the second quarter is likely to be lower than previously anticipated.",
        "Another member argued that retail sales along with certain leading indicators in advanced economies, such as the purchasing managers’ and consumer confidence indexes, remain at levels much lower than those registered prior to the pandemic.",
        "All members pointed out that in this context multilateral organizations and analysts have once again revised their economic expectations for 2020 downwards.",
        "Some members mentioned that falls in world GDP of between 4.9 and 6% are anticipated.",
        "One member stated that it is reasonable to expect that the world’s economic recovery will be slower than previously estimated.",
        "Most members underlined that a recovery is expected during the second half of the year and in 2021, although said expectations are subject to a high degree of uncertainty.",
        "Among risks to mentioned a second outbreak of infections.",
        "Some members added the risk that fiscal relief measures are insufficient or are withdrawn prematurely.",
        "One member noted the significance of the latter risk for economies showing considerable levels of indebtedness.",
        "Some members mentioned the possibility of additional episodes of turmoil in international financial markets.",
        "Some members added the possibility of political and social instability associated with the deterioration of socioeconomic conditions.",
        "One member mentioned the resurgence of trade disputes and the presidential elections in the U.S.",
        "In this context, some members pointed out that the balance of risks for world economic growth remains biased to the downside.",
        "Some members mentioned that weak global demand has brought about contractions in commodity prices, especially of energy products.",
        "One member stated that this has affected public revenue and emerging economies’ terms of trade.",
        "Another member pointed out that although these prices are still at low levels as compared to the beginning of the year, their quotes have improved and market instruments suggest stability in the future.",
        "Most members mentioned that in advanced economies headline and core inflation are below their central bank’s targets.",
        "Some members stated that in most economies, including emerging ones, inflation has declined due to a lower demand for a wide range of goods and services.",
        "They pointed out that this occurred despite the supply constraints and the increases in the prices of food and medical services.",
        "One member added that a low inflation trajectory is anticipated at the global level, while another one added that in emerging economies expectations drawn from market instruments remain at low levels.",
        "In view of the described environment, most members highlighted that central banks in advanced and emerging economies have eased their monetary policy stances.",
        "The majority of schemes to promote the well-functioning of their financial systems.",
        "Likewise, most members expressed their readiness to maintain easing measures for as long as necessary or even to strengthen them.",
        "Some members stressed that the Federal Reserve projections estimate the federal funds target range to remain between 0 and 0.25% at least until 2022.",
        "One member added that said central bank announced the possibility of implementing a yield curve control scheme.",
        "Another member noted that in most emerging economies central banks have continued to ease their monetary stances and that real interest rates in these countries are currently close to 0% or are even at negative levels.",
        "Most members stated that various countries have adopted important fiscal stimulus measures to mitigate the adverse effects on employment and on households’ and firms’ incomes.",
        "One member expressed that certain advanced economies, by having a reserve currency and well-developed institutions, have managed to promote a significant and broad range of relief measures for employment and guarantee programs for businesses and households.",
        "He/she added that in emerging economies a greater heterogeneity is observed regarding the amount and the type of implemented measures.",
        "All members highlighted that, since the last markets have exhibited a positive behavior, reflecting the effects of the fiscal, monetary and financial stimulus measures adopted by the advanced economies and the gradual reopening of their productive activities.",
        "Most members highlighted the lower risk aversion, the increase in stock market indexes, the appreciation of currencies against the US dollar, a certain reduction in government bond yields, and an increase in commodity prices.",
        "Some members recalled that initially the pandemic had propitiated an increase in risk aversion, a deterioration of financial conditions and a recomposition of investors’ portfolios.",
        "One member pointed out that, despite the recent improvement, different analysts have warned about a possible overvaluation of equity markets and that certain studies indicate an increase in the rate of default of high-yield bonds.",
        "Most members stated that financial markets in performance as well.",
        "However, the majority of members specified that equity markets continue registering outflows, which, according to one of them, denotes a persisting sentiment of risk aversion.",
        "Some mentioned that inflows in fixed-income instruments were observed.",
        "Nonetheless, one member considered that the demand for such instruments remains weak, as well as the fragility and the low depth in financial markets of emerging economies, which have been affected by the important economic contraction as well as by the fall in commodity prices and other revenues from abroad.",
        "He/she underlined that during this period of higher uncertainty, these economies registered exchange rate and interest rate pressures, increases in risk premia, falls in stock market indexes and capital outflows.",
        "He/she added that agencies have downgraded the credit ratings of multiple sovereign issuers and firms, exacerbating the financial shock and the risk aversion process in a pro-cyclical fashion.",
        "Another member mentioned that the fiscal front in emerging economies continues to be a risk factor, since a deterioration both in the balances as well as in the debt to GDP ratio is expected, due to the budgetary pressures arising from the stimulus programs and decreased economic activity.",
        "Most members mentioned that global financial conditions will remain subject to the evolution and the effects of the pandemic, and therefore the environment of uncertainty is expected to persist.",
        "One member noted that the dynamics of contagion associated with the pandemic can deteriorate and affect once again economic activity and markets, with the consequent impact on firms and households’ solvency as well as on the lesssound financial intermediaries.",
        "All members made reference to the severe deterioration of economic activity in Mexico.",
        "Most members pointed out that it contracted significantly during the first quarter of the year and that, according to available information, the impact of the pandemic intensified in April.",
        "Some members stated that an important fall is estimated for the second quarter.",
        "One member indicated that it would be deeper than expected since, because of the duration of the pandemic, the reopening of economic activities has been more gradual than anticipated.",
        "He/she considered that, although limited available information and high uncertainty make an accurate analysis of the recent performance of economic activity difficult, different indicators show a smaller contraction, or even a slight recovery, at the beginning of May, although starting from very low levels, mainly as a result of the gradual reopening of the economy.",
        "Most members pointed out that the lockdown measures have affected aggregate demand.",
        "One member stated that, at the end of the first quarter, consumption and investment contracted 1.2 and estimated to have continued declining as a result of uncertainty and the large loss of employment.",

        "One member mentioned that automotive exports fell 79%.",
        "From the supply side, most members indicated that in April industrial production contracted 29.6% in annual terms, reflecting disruptions in global value chains and production shutdowns.",
        "Some members pointed out that manufacturing production and construction decreased 35 and 38% in annual terms, respectively, and highlighted the weakness of the services sector.",
        "One member underlined the contraction in entertainment, accommodation and food preparation services.",
        "emphasized the significant fall in employment figures.",
        "The majority of members pointed out that, according to INEGI data, considering both amounted to 12.5 million in April.",
        "One member indicated that over 10 million correspond to the informal sector and that most jobs lost had incomes of two minimum wages or less, which indicates that the most vulnerable sector of the population has been particularly affected.",
        "Some members pointed out that during the first five months of the year around one million IMSS-insured jobs were lost.",
        "One member added that withdrawals from personal Afore accounts due to unemployment reached historical maximum levels.",
        "Another member added that, according to INEGI’s Telephone Survey of Occupation and Employment, the national unemployment rate is currently at 4.7%.",
        "Most members highlighted the rise in the number of underemployed workers as well as in the population that is not economically active, but is available for work.",
        "One member expressed that the lower labor participation partially explains why the unemployment rate did not increase so much.",
        "Another member pointed out that, if individuals that are “available” for work are considered as part of the economically active population, the “concealed” unemployment rate would be 25.4% of the labor force.",
        "He/she added that if underemployed workers are included as well, the rate for the indicator known as the labor gap would reach 50.6%.",
        "One member underlined that the number of individuals either unemployed, available for work or underemployed, increased by over 20 million between March and April.",
        "Another member argued that, considering the number of businesses that have closed down permanently, based on the number of those that have withdrawn their registration at the IMSS, it can be concluded that a large part of the current unemployment is permanent, since these are not jobs that may be regained during the reactivation of the economy.",
        "reopening of certain economic sectors and regions in May and June will foster a slight recovery of economic activity, the impact has been considerable and uncertainty persists.",
        "The majority of members added that indicators of manufacturing orders and of business and consumer confidence are at low levels.",
        "One member indicated that implementation of the USMCA and the anticipated recovery of the US economy should support investment, but that this would hardly be sufficient to raise it to the required levels, given the perception by the corporate sector of an important worsening of the business climate.",
        "He/she asserted that in the next months investment is unlikely to support the economic recovery significantly.",

        "All members underlined that the growth outlook has deteriorated.",
        "Most members indicated that for 2020 there are even projections of a two-digit contraction.",
        "Some members specified that the IMF has recently adjusted its forecast from -6.6 to -10.5%.",
        "One member added that the consensus of analysts’ forecasts has been adjusted from -7.5 to -8.3%.",
        "Another member mentioned that there is a broad dispersion in the projections, which reflects high uncertainty, and that downward revisions for upward adjustment in expectations for 2021, which point to a modest recovery.",
        "One member stated that a very deep recession is currently being observed, with a slow and complex “U”-shaped recovery, due to the severe deterioration of investment and consumption.",
        "He/she added that the possibility of a second COVID-19 outbreak, or that the sanitary and economic measures are simply insufficient, has increased the risk of a “W”-shaped economic recovery.",
        "Another member pointed out that the duration and depth of the economic contraction depends on the suspension of economic activities established by the authorities as well as on selfimposed restrictions by the productive agents, which, in turn, will depend on progress in the development of a therapy or a vaccine against the virus.",
        "Most members agreed that the balance of risks for growth remains significantly biased to the downside.",
        "The majority of members stressed the risk of a new COVID-19 outbreak.",

        "Some members emphasized the risk that the health measures that have been adopted to contain the epidemic are not sufficient.",
        "One member indicated that a high rate of contagion has been observed in Mexico.",
        "Another member noted that the estimated date on which the health crisis will reach its peak in Mexico has been repeatedly delayed, which combined with the experience in other countries suggests that the risk of new outbreaks once the process of economic reopening deepens is high.",
        "On the other hand, some members mentioned the lack of a balanced policy approach, particularly on the fiscal front, to foster the economic recovery.",
        "implications to the productive apparatus can have a prolonged effect on employment and consumption levels.",

        "Some members added that the recent decline in growth forecasts allows to anticipate that the negative output gap will continue widening.",
        "One member emphasized that the output gap is at levels unseen since the 2008-2009 financial crisis.",
        "Most members mentioned that annual headline inflation rose from 2.15 to 3.17% between April and the first fortnight of June 2020 due to increases in both its non-core and core components.",
        "Most members agreed that the recent performance of inflation is associated with demand- and supply-related shocks derived from the pandemic.",
        "Some members stated that the weakness of domestic demand has been reflected in lower price variations of different goods and services.",
        "One member pointed out that for several months headline inflation has been close to its target, mainly as a result of fluctuations in the non-core component, since core inflation has not declined.",
        "Another member recalled that in May headline inflation remained below the target for the second consecutive month.",
        "One member pointed out that the referred shocks have led to a recomposition of relative prices, which has led to higher food prices to the detriment of the most vulnerable households, a phenomenon that is not adequately reflected in the CPI, considering the weights used in its measurement.",
        "Delving into the evolution of non-core inflation, most members emphasized that energy prices contracted in annual terms, although some members stated that these have increased recently.",
        "Most members noted the increase in fruit and vegetables prices.",
        "One member pointed out that such increase is due to a comparison base effect and to transitory factors.",
        "He/she considered that the effect of low energy products’ prices prevails over the rebound in fruit and vegetables prices.",
        "As to core inflation, most members highlighted the rise in food merchandise prices, due to possible supply problems and to a reallocation of household’s spending in light of the health emergency.",
        "Some members underlined that core inflation remains at high levels.",
        "One member considered that the persistence of this component, despite the economic contraction and the higher levels of economic slack, suggests that increases in some line items such as food merchandises, have outweighed the reductions observed in non-food merchandise and services prices.",
        "Another member pointed out that social distancing is interrupting the provision of several services, whose price variations are decreasing.",
        "One member noted that three of the five major core inflation components registered annual rates of change below 3% in the first fortnight of June: housing, non-food merchandises and services other than education and housing.",
        "He/she added that educational services prices registered an annual inflation above the inflation target, which is explained by the fact that said prices tend to be fixed in August, and that thus, it will not be until that month that an adjustment will be observed in said indicator.",
        "He/she considered that the only component with a really unfavorable behavior is that of food merchandises, which has increased due to a reallocation of household spending and to disruptions in the supply of certain goods.",
        "Nevertheless, he/she pointed out that at least part of these effects may possibly disappear once consumption and supply of said merchandises return to normal.",
        "Most members noted that headline inflation expectations for the end of 2020 remain at levels near the target, and those for the medium and long terms have remained relatively stable, although at levels above 3%.",
        "One member stated that headline inflation expectations for 2020 increased from 2.90 in April to 3.07% in May.",
        "Another member added that medium- and long-term core inflation expectations also lie close to 3.5%.",
        "He/she highlighted that it is surprising that core inflation expectations for the next five to eight years have increased to such level in the course of this year, which suggests the risk of them becoming unanchored.",
        "He/she noted that, although he/she does not agree with these projections, they reveal the uncertainty that prevails regarding the behavior of inflation and, particularly, the potential of new shocks on prices, as well as the risk of the peso exchange rate being subject to pressures, due to external or domestic factors.",
        "One member pointed out that inflation expectations drawn from both surveys and market instruments increased slightly after the publication of the latest monetary policy decision and the latest Quarterly Report.",
        "Thus, he/she argued that it is essential that the central bank communications do not validate a pessimistic outlook on the economy since this affects the perception of private agents.",
        "As to the expected trajectory for inflation, another member pointed out that the central bank baseline scenario expects that it will lay around the target within the horizon in which monetary policy operates.",
        "He/she added that, if the adequate performance of both global and domestic financial markets and of the peso exchange rate continues, it may contribute to a trajectory slightly below the one published in the latest Quarterly Report.",
        "One member stated that annual inflation would lie at levels close or even below the target for the remainder of 2020.",
        "He/she mentioned that the lower oil prices, the weakness of aggregate demand, a stable exchange rate, and a low pass-through would contribute to this.",
        "Similarly, another member mentioned that headline inflation shows an important decline since last year and shortterm inflation expectations lie at around 3% for the end of the year, mainly motivated by the widening of the output gap in negative territory.",
        "One member considered that it is not foreseeable that headline inflation will converge to the target during the rest of behavior of non-core inflation.",
        "He/she added that, in the absence of further shocks, core inflation should start to reflect in that span of time the impact of the wide negative output gap.",
        "He/she pointed out that it is reasonable to anticipate that headline inflation will converge to the target during the second half of 2021, although inflation expectations show that private sector forecasters are not incorporating such scenario.",
        "Regarding the risks for inflation, some members highlighted the downward pressures stemming from a greater than expected impact of the wider negative output gap and from downward inflationary pressures worldwide.",
        "As to upward risks, some members mentioned additional episodes of foreign exchange depreciation, as well as logistical and supply-related problems concerning certain goods and services.",
        "One member added the possibility of the increase in labor costs in previous months affecting inflation.",
        "He/she noted that although inflation remains at low levels, there are upward pressures on items that affect lower-income households.",
        "He/she also highlighted that uncertainty worsens due to measurement challenges stemming from the impact of the lockdown.",
        "He/she stated that difficulties in price collection may imply challenges to the comparability of indicators and lower information quality.",
        "Most members pointed out that the balance of risks for inflation remains uncertain.",
        "In this regard, one member noted that the supply and demand shocks faced are passed on to the price formation process through different channels that generate both upward and downward pressures; thus, the net effect is uncertain.",
        "Another member emphasized that the outlook for the global and domestic economy remains uncertain and subject to bouts of high volatility.",
        "In this regard, he/she considered that the balance of risks for inflation visà-vis the updated outlook remains uncertain.",
        "He/she mentioned that the final result of factors that could put downward or upward pressures on inflation will depend on the intensity of the effect of each of them, in an environment of deep economic weakness both globally and domestically.",
        "He/she added that, if the financial shock remains contained, the effects of the significant widening of the negative output gap could predominate in a longer-term horizon.",
        "Another member expressed his/her view that, in light of the uncertainty about the evolution of the pandemic and economic activity, and of pressures on prices in both directions, downward pressures prevail over upward pressures on inflation, and that it is very likely that they will continue to do so.",
        "Most members noted that, since the latest monetary policy decision, there has been an improvement in the performance of domestic financial markets.",
        "Some members highlighted that this was partly due to the measures adopted by Banco de México.",
        "One member mentioned that external factors, particularly a greater optimism about the performance of advanced economies due to the gradual resumption of productive activities, have also contributed importantly to said results.",
        "Most members pointed out that the peso exchange government securities, particularly for short members added that the sovereign risk continued to adjust downwards and that the stock market showed an improvement.",
        "Nevertheless, most members noted that risks persist and capital outflows have continued, although at a slower pace vis-à-vis what was observed some weeks ago.",
        "Some members pointed out that accumulated figures indicate outflows higher than USD 13 billion in fixed income.",
        "In this regard, one member underlined that total government securities held by non-residents currently amount to around USD 90 billion.",
        "Another member added that cumulative figures for the year show zero flow in the case of equity instruments.",
        "Some members warned that trading conditions remain deteriorated in the FX and fixed income markets.",
        "One member stated that the Mexican peso remains among the emerging economies’ currencies with the largest annual depreciation and that the balance of the net foreign exchange-rate position continued to widen negatively.",
        "He/she mentioned that the steepening of the yield curve suggests that there are still concerns about idiosyncratic factors.",
        "As to risks for domestic financial markets, some members highlighted the persisting challenges over the situation of Pemex and public finances, as well as the institutional weakening.",
        "Regarding external risks, one member mentioned that those stemming from the pandemic, the relationship between the United States, China and other countries, and the US presidential election stand out.",
        "Most members highlighted that, in this adverse environment, perseverance in strengthening the macroeconomic fundamentals and adopting the necessary actions, regarding both monetary and fiscal policies, will contribute to a better adjustment of domestic financial markets and of the economy as a whole.",
        "One member added that the adverse shocks that the economy is facing must be mitigated to contain the impact on employment and to preserve productive capacity.",
        "The above within a framework that maintains the sustainability of public finances, a low and stable inflation, as well as a sound and well-capitalized financial system.",
        "Some members noted that in April budgetary revenues were below the programmed amount, and that even after considering the use of resources from the Budget Revenue Stabilization Fund (FEIP, for its acronym in Spanish) and other extraordinary revenues, public finances are expected to show a significant deterioration during the year.",
        "In particular, one member highlighted that the shortfall in oil revenues including oil hedges, and tax revenues excluding those from the excise tax (IEPS, for its acronym in Spanish), would be between 2.2 and that such shortfall would be partially offset with the use of non-recurring revenues from the FEIP and with the recovery of financial assets from funds and trusts.",
        "Most members expressed concern on Pemex’s shortfall in public revenues may widen in the face of additional capitalization requirements by the stateowned company, due to its financial problems, the sharp fall in its sales and the continuation of nonprofitable projects, the financial burden and risk of which concentrate on the federal government.",
        "Another member highlighted that the need to design a long-term solution for Pemex’s problems has increased.",
        "He/she added that, in the absence of specific measures in said direction, as well as in general to permanently strengthen government revenues, it would not be convenient to seek greater support from fiscal policy to face the pandemic, taking into account the expected decline in the FEIP balances and the resulting increase in the vulnerability of public finances.",
        "Although he/she acknowledged that there is also the option of an important reallocation of public spending, he/she considered that no support for adjustments of such nature is perceived.",
        "As for sovereign credit rating revisions and possible additional downgradings, one member warned that these have resulted in tighter financial conditions for both government and firms.",
        "He/she stated that the recently observed corporate debt issuances continue to be insufficient to roll-over short-term debt that has being maturing during the year and that, for this reason, firms have resorted to commercial banks.",
        "He/she stated that even though credit channels continue to function in an orderly manner and do not show warning signs, the delinquency rates of consumption and corporate portfolios in the segment of small- and medium-sized firms (SMEs) have risen.",
        "He/she mentioned that according to the latest Financial Stability Report, at the beginning of the pandemic the banking system overall was in a solid position; however, some smaller banks could face problems.",
        "He/she added that without decisive fiscal supports, firms and households’ situation could rapidly deteriorate regardless of the availability of resources and the level of interest rates.",
        "When analyzing the longer-term macroeconomic situation, another member stated that the outlook for investment, which is fundamental for the potential growth of the economy, is worrisome.",
        "He/she warned that investment has been following a downward trend since mid-2018 and is currently at levels similar to those at the beginning of 2011.",
        "He/she mentioned that although the pandemic recently influenced this behavior, the main determinants have been the situation of public finances and an environment which is considered unfavorable for private investment by the business sector.",
        "He/she highlighted that, for the first time since 2011, Mexico is no longer part of the list of the main 25 foreign investment destinations in a survey conducted by a consulting firm.",
        "He/she underlined the business sector’s persisting concern for the country’s rule of law and insecurity situation, the deterioration of the institutional framework, and the orientation of some public policies, among other aspects.",
        "Taking into account the referred risks for markets, and based on the foreseen scenarios and on the room for maneuvering that on balance these provide to monetary policy, all members agreed to lower the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 50 basis points to a One member pointed out that monetary policy faces challenges in two dimensions: the deep economic contraction associated with the pandemic and its effects on inflation, and the impact of the financial shock of global risk aversion on the peso exchange rate and investment portfolios.",
        "The above considering that domestic financial markets are highly integrated to international markets, where the Mexican peso is one of the few emerging economies’ currencies that is fully convertible, with 80% of its volume traded among non-residents, which implies low operating costs for holding short- or long-term positions in pesos.",
        "He/she highlighted that, to the extent that the relative importance of global risk factors decreases, idiosyncratic elements such as the economic and financial soundness, the growth outlook, and remaining an attractive destination for investment, will gain relevance once again to avoid abrupt adjustments in portfolios.",
        "In this context, he/she argued that the monetary policy stance should consider both the economy’s cyclical position and its influence on inflation, as well as the financial conditions required for macroeconomic stability and an orderly adjustment in financial markets and in the financial system.",
        "He/she added that, considering that the financial and economic activity shocks operate at different horizons, it is important to mitigate the financial shock in the best possible way, in order to have greater room for maneuver to face the impact of the shock on economic activity.",
        "He/she stated that to the extent that an orderly adjustment of financial markets is achieved, it will be possible to maintain a domestic inflation process in line with the global trend towards lower inflation.",
        "As for the determinants of capital flows to emerging economies, some members pointed out that insofar as global risk aversion decreases, idiosyncratic factors may gain relevance.",
        "Some members argued that in this context the spread between domestic and external interest rates may gain greater importance in offsetting idiosyncratic risks and avoiding net capital outflows.",
        "One noted that there is recent evidence that this is already happening.",
        "Another member noted that a considerable number of emerging economies have reduced their interest rate spread more than Mexico, without jeopardizing their financial markets or inflation targets.",
        "He/she added that there is evidence showing that capital flows also depend on growth expectations, and therefore to the extent that a lower interest rate contributes to growth, it could contribute to maintain or attract greater capital flows.",
        "He/she stated that the increase in longterm asset holdings by the US Federal Reserve implies a _de facto decrease of its interest rate,_ meaning that it is not necessarily correct to measure the interest rate spread vis-à-vis the federal funds rate.",
        "In this regard, he/she argued that a less restrictive monetary policy could contribute to reduce the risk of a very deep economic fall, which would contribute to a better performance of financial markets.",
        "One member noted that several indicators show that, with the monetary policy decisions taken in the last months, the interest rate spread adjusted by exchange rate volatility vis-à-vis other emerging economies has narrowed considerably.",
        "He/she stated that this is important for an economy as open to capital flows as that of Mexico, and where its currency is frequently used to hedge risks in other emerging economies due to its high liquidity.",
        "He/she warned that this brings to the fore the limitations of making direct comparisons between interest rate levels in Mexico and other emerging economies.",
        "He/she also pointed out that, unlike Mexico, in most major emerging economies headline and core inflation are below their respective central banks’ targets.",
        "He/she also highlighted that, given the inflation levels and the high volatility of the peso exchange rate, the latter may have significant implications for the attainment of the inflation target in Mexico, despite its low pass-through.",
        "Most members considered that monetary policy should continue to incorporate all available environment of uncertainty.",
        "Some members stated that all challenges and dilemmas that monetary policy is facing must be identified and a wide range of scenarios must also be considered.",
        "One member argued that, in light of the downward revisions to economic growth for this year, the wider economic slack, the appreciation of the peso and the recent evolution of inflation, there is some room to continue easing monetary policy.",
        "He/she noted that the challenge is how to manage such room.",
        "In this regard, he/she emphasized that in face of the global and domestic uncertainty no scenario, neither benign nor of additional deterioration, can be ruled out; thus, monetary policy should be conducted with extreme caution, continuing with a gradual approach, monitoring the latest information to update forecasts and maintain room for maneuver to take the necessary actions in a timely and prudent manner.",
        "In this context, he/she added that it is essential to monitor the persisting risks, some of which have already started to materialize.",
        "Among the risks to be considered, in addition to the aforementioned, he/she highlighted: i) the volatility stemming from domestic or external factors that may affect the peso exchange rate and its impact on inflation forecasts; ii) the persistence of core inflation at high levels, despite the increased amount of economic slack and the uncertainty about the net effect of supply- and demand-related shocks, and iii) idiosyncratic risks, in particular, weak public finances for 2020 and 2021 and the vulnerable financial situation of Pemex, in a context in which the loss of the investment grade of the sovereign credit rating is not ruled out.",
        "Another member stated that, although there appears to be additional room to reduce the policy rate, it is to be expected that risks are also increasing and thus any adjustment in such direction should be based on that assumption.",
        "In this regard, he/she highlighted that in addition to the important tightening of interest rate spreads relative to other emerging economies, and the volatility to which the peso is subject, it is essential to consider that the balance of risks for inflation remains uncertain; that long-term inflation expectations continue above the target; that core inflation is not yielding; and that the possibility of an unanchoring of long-term expectations for this component has increased.",
        "One member argued that in terms of the absolute monetary policy stance, slack conditions offer room for further monetary easing.",
        "He/she stated that in the face of a crisis of unprecedented magnitude, a much laxer monetary policy stance would support the weak economic activity.",
        "He/she added that in terms of the relative policy stance, lower risk premia open up the possibility for a smaller spread.",
        "Nonetheless, he/she pointed that said room could face limitations in the future, since such premia could be underestimating global risks.",
        "He/she pointed out that possible medium-term negative effects on the macrofinancial framework, resulting from easing the monetary policy that is needed in the short term, should also be considered.",
        "He/she highlighted that a terminal rate will eventually be attained and an excessive reduction in the interest rate could discourage savings, domestic and foreign, which are scarce in the country.",
        "In particular, foreign capital has shown, even before the increase in risk aversion due to the pandemic, a decline in its enthusiasm for investing in this country.",
        "He/she underlined that an excessively low interest rate could affect bank savings, the exchange rate and could distort the prices of other financial assets, which in the medium term could have implications for financial stability.",
        "The same member stated that the adjustment of interest rates will depend on the evolution of risks and on the behavior of the economic cycle.",
        "He/she added that given the economic outlook, the lack of fiscal support and the fragile foundations for the decline in inflation, the strategy will be to consider daily incoming information as the best guide in the future.",
        "He/she stated that the scope of monetary policy and the room for maneuver must be taken into account to sensibly respond to the uncertainty.",
        "Among the referred scope, he/she mentioned the implementation of programs to provide liquidity, increase the flexibility of the regulatory framework, loosen prudential measures, and other tools to strengthen the functioning of the financial system.",
        "He/she considered that so far the response to uncertainty is to continue the process of monetary easing by lowering the reference rate in a fixed amount, at a constant speed, which markets can fully anticipate.",
        "Another member considered that in light of the significant economic contraction that is foreseen and the challenges that this implies, the central bank must act cautiously but firmly and use all the instruments at its disposal.",
        "This implies for the real interest rate to possibly be taken to levels close to zero or even negative before the end of the year, as long as the inflation rate remains close to target.",
        "He/she indicated that the central bank must be willing to act in case signs of a significant deterioration of economic-financial conditions arise, and that this includes taking actions in unscheduled dates.",
        "Most members considered important to continue implementing measures to strengthen the credit provision channels, provide liquidity and foster the well-functioning of the financial system.",
        "Some members considered that said measures could be more effective with a lower policy rate.",
        "One member stated that the policy rate has an impact on economic activity through various channels, including the credit channel.",
        "He/she added that in the current juncture, the availability of credit is crucial to prevent solvent firms from going bankrupt due to liquidity problems, and therefore the central bank measures to facilitate lending to small- and mediumsized firms are appropriate.",
        "However, he/she considered that if these are not accompanied by a sufficiently low interest rate, economic agents will not have incentives to acquire credit and their demand will remain limited.",
        "He/she mentioned the importance of avoiding that the Central Bank actions in one dimension (credit facilities) be limited by its actions in another dimension (interest rates).",
        "Another member added that the persistence of risk aversion and pressure in financial markets point to the need to ensure adequate liquidity levels in markets and lax monetary conditions.",
        "Some members pointed out the importance of Banco de México focusing on fulfilling its primary mandate.",
        "One member stated that monetary policy’s best contribution during the recovery phase is to fulfil this mandate and thus avoid households’ purchasing power from further deteriorating.",
        "He/she mentioned that the central bank needs to monitor the circumstances that reduce the purchasing power of low-income households and that worsen the severe loss of income of the unemployed population.",
        "Another member stated that monetary policy’s best contribution to strengthening public finances is to focus on fulfilling its mandate, as this leads to sustained reductions in interest rates along the yield curve and ultimately fosters economic growth.",
        "He/she argued that if the support to public finances were to be perceived as part of monetary policy’s reaction function, markets would rapidly consider it as a situation of fiscal dominance, which would affect the central bank’s credibility and the level of mediumand long-term interest rates, with substantial negative effects on the fiscal accounts and on the Mexican economy.",
        "One member pointed out that the central bank communications must highlight the need for maintaining inflation at low levels, especially in the items of greater relevance for the population, such as food merchandise, in order to prevent inflation expectations from becoming unanchored.",
        "Another member pointed out that the monetary policy statement must emphasize that, by taking into account new downward revisions to growth expectations, the policy decision is consistent with the convergence of inflation to the target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates.",
        "He/she added that it must emphasize that Banco de México will remain attentive to incoming information to continue acting, as it has done so far, with timeliness and caution.",
        "Taking into account the referred risks for inflation, economic activity and financial markets, major challenges arise for monetary policy and for the economy in general.",
        "Based on the foreseen scenarios, and considering the room for maneuvering that on balance these provide to monetary policy, with the presence of all its members, Banco de México’s Governing Board decided unanimously to lower the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 50 basis points to a level of 5%.",
        "The Governing Board will take the necessary actions on the basis of incoming information and considering the large impact on productive activity as well as the evolution of the financial shock that we are currently facing, so that the policy rate is consistent with the orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to Banco de México’s target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates.",
        "Perseverance in strengthening the macroeconomic fundamentals and adopting the necessary actions, regarding both monetary and fiscal policies, will contribute to a better adjustment of domestic financial markets and of the economy as a whole.",
        "Alejandro Díaz de León-Carrillo, Irene EspinosaCantellano, Gerardo Esquivel-Hernández, Javier Eduardo Guzmán-Calafell and Jonathan Ernest Heath-Constable voted in favor of lowering the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 50 basis points to a level of 5%.",
        "All members pointed out that the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures adopted to prevent its spread have affected world economic activity considerably.",
        "Most members indicated that in the last weeks the virus has spread rapidly, and one member noted that some countries appear to have managed to contain the pandemic.",
        "Another member stated that open economies that are integrated into global value chains and with a high exposure to services provided person-to-person are more affected by the production shutdowns stemming from the isolation measures.",
        "On the demand side, he/she considered that households’ and firms’ spending and income are being very affected.",
        "He/she added that numerous firms are facing a highly uncertain environment regarding the demand for their goods and services.",
        "He/she mentioned that production constraints and impacts on demand will lead to a significant fall in employment, aggravating the economic contraction.",
        "All members pointed out that the complex worldwide economic situation has led to significant revisions of economic expectations, productive activity in the first half of 2020.",
        "Most members stated that declines in economic activity of the magnitude that is anticipated, have not been seen since the Great Depression.",
        "One member pointed out that it is estimated that the impact will be larger in advanced economies, which would intensify the world demand shock.",
        "He/she added that among emerging economies, Latin American economies would be affected the most as a result of lower commodity prices, a large informal sector, and fragile fiscal positions.",
        "Some members emphasized that, although a significant recovery is expected in 2021, this is subject to considerable risks, including: i) the uncertainty regarding the timing, conditions and the pace of the economy’s reopening; ii) the possibility of a reemergence of epidemiological outbreaks in the absence of a vaccine or effective treatment; iii) a greater caution to resume activities, and iv) that the damage to the production apparatus and the supply chains turns out to be difficult to revert, especially if the financial systems are considerably affected.",
        "All members noted that the outlook for the world Most members mentioned that the impact to economic activity has propitiated a sharp fall in commodity prices, especially of crude oil.",
        "Most members added that, given the lower demand and a practically nil storage capacity, even negative figures were registered in the futures’ contracts to be settled next month.",
        "One member specified that this occurred despite the agreements achieved recently among the main oil producers.",
        "Another member mentioned that inflation pressures are contained in most countries, and underlined that inflation expectations implied by market instruments for the main economies remain below those registered at the beginning of the year.",
        "members stated that several central banks of advanced and emerging economies lowered their economies register close to zero or even negative interest rates.",
        "One member added that said measures seek to influence not only the risk-free rate, but also the risk premia faced by firms, lowering the cost of credit and thus generating confidence.",
        "He/she highlighted that central banks in emerging economies are expected to continue easing their monetary policy stances, reaching close to zero or negative real interest rates.",
        "Most members pointed out that several central banks have also implemented extraordinary measures to foster the well-functioning of their financial systems.",
        "Most members emphasized the measures to stabilize foreign exchange markets, the asset purchase programs, and the actions to strengthen both the liquidity facilities available for financial intermediaries and the channels of credit provision.",
        "One member highlighted that the US Federal Reserve included corporate debt with a wide range of credit ratings in its asset purchase program.",
        "Most members stated that several countries have implemented fiscal measures to mitigate the households’ and firms’ income.",
        "One member mentioned that the adoption of said measures also seeks to prevent a risk aversion spiral in financial markets.",
        "Some members highlighted that the support to households and firms has reached significant amounts as a share of GDP in the main advanced economies.",
        "One member indicated that said measures in advanced economies will be mainly financed with public debt.",
        "Most members emphasized that the adverse environment has generated an increase in risk aversion, worsening global financial conditions and leading to a recomposition of investors’ portfolios towards lower-risk assets.",
        "Most members pointed out that stock markets in affected by the realignment of portfolios towards safe haven assets.",
        "However, most members acknowledged that during the last month there was a slight improvement in international financial markets following the announcement of monetary, fiscal and financial support measures, although some mentioned that a fragile and volatile environment persists.",
        "One member pointed out that there are considerable potential pressures on global financial markets in addition to those stemming from the current situation, such as the reemergence and escalation of trade, political and geopolitical tensions.",
        "Most members stressed that in this context emerging economies have registered significant capital outflows.",
        "Most members mentioned that this has led to a depreciation of their currencies and to volatility in their foreign exchange markets, as well as to pressures on stock indices and interest rates.",
        "Some members mentioned that capital outflows this year have accumulated the highest amount on record.",
        "One member added that this was exacerbated by the fall in commodity prices and in other sources of external revenue, such as those related to tourism and remittances.",
        "Another member mentioned that inflation pressures derived from the exchange rate adjustment are contained in most of these countries.",
        "He/she stated that most central banks in emerging economies have lowered their interest rates significantly so far this year.",
        "He/she also noted that expectations for the policy rate average in these economies for the end of 2020 are below 3.5%, which implies that emerging economies are adopting accommodative monetary policy stances with close to zero or even negative real interest rates.",
        "Most members agreed that the pandemic is an unprecedented shock.",
        "One member stated that the macroeconomic outlook has changed radically since the last monetary policy decision.",
        "Another member pointed out that this is due to the supply and demand shocks caused by social distancing and the economic lockdown.",
        "One member mentioned that Mexico currently has over 8 thousand confirmed COVID-19 cases and around 700 deaths, and that the peak of infections is expected to be reached in the next weeks.",
        "Another member stated that the absence of a treatment, the rapid spread of the outbreak, and the fatality of the pandemic have serious human and economic implications.",
        "As for domestic economic activity, most members stated that supply has been affected by interruptions in the production of goods and services, as well as by the closure of businesses.",
        "Meanwhile, demand has been affected by lower consumption, as a result of a decline in individuals’ incomes and of fewer spending opportunities, as well as by lower investment and lower external demand, partly due to the deceleration of the US economy.",
        "Some members noted the effect of the fall in crude oil prices.",
        "Most members mentioned that the impact of the shock can already be observed in a number of variables, such as: i) consumer and business purchasing managers’ indices; v) vehicle sales; vi) air and land transportation, and vii) hotel occupancy and tourist flow.",
        "One member added that economic activity had already been exhibiting a persistent weakness, as shown by spending and production indicators for the first quarter of the year.",
        "With respect to the labor market, most members highlighted the deterioration observed in the employment figures reported by the IMSS.",
        "Some members highlighted that, in March, formal employment registered the greatest monthly decline on record.",
        "One member pointed out that, during that month’s contraction, the losses in the services and construction sectors and in the manufacturing industry stand out.",
        "Another member added that, between March 13 and April 6, 347 thousand formal jobs were lost, more than the total amount of jobs created in 2019.",
        "He/she considered that at such rate by the end of April approximately 700 thousand jobs would be lost, as compared to the 2009 crisis, when around 600 thousand jobs were lost over a 12-month period.",
        "In this context, one member mentioned that the main danger we face is a loss of employments in the short term that will not be able to be recovered in the medium term, sentencing a share of the population to a situation of structural poverty.",
        "All members pointed out that, in view of the impact of the pandemic, Mexican economic activity is anticipated to contract significantly acknowledging that the magnitude and duration of the pandemic’s effects are still unknown, and that available information is still limited.",
        "One member stated that various indicators allow to foresee a severe weakening of the services sector.",
        "He/she added that automotive production contracted over 24% in annual terms in March, which signals an important deterioration of manufacturing activity.",
        "He/she specified that this scenario could deteriorate as a consequence of the extension of the social distancing measures.",
        "In this context, he/she mentioned that some specialists anticipate a contraction of up to 34% in annualized terms in the second quarter.",
        "One member emphasized that concerns over the severity of the economic contraction grow week after week and are reflected in the continuous downward revisions to forecasts, including those of multilateral organizations.",
        "Another member pointed out, in order to provide a sense of the size of the adjustment in the economic projections, that at the moment of the March monetary policy decision the median forecast of the survey conducted by a commercial bank anticipated GDP growth for 2020 and for 2021 of 0.7 and 1.6%, respectively, while currently these figures are at -5 and 1.8%, respectively, and that additional downward adjustments are being observed at the margin.",
        "One member highlighted that the forecast range for 2020 and for 2021 is atypically wide, lying between -9 and -3.9% and between 0.4 and 5.5%.",
        "Some members stated that a recession is expected with a significant impact on the labor market and on production.",
        "One member noted that, unlike the 2019 stagnation, when the greatest impact came from international trade and from manufacturing activity, on this occasion the most significant contraction is anticipated to take place in the non-manufacturing sector, especially in services and commerce, which will have more severe repercussions on employment and occupation.",
        "Another member considered that due to a lower external demand, a lower income of the population, the loss of confidence, and the risk for investment associated with the deterioration of economic conditions, the impact on demand will be deeper and longer than that on supply, which he/she mentioned would be transitory.",
        "One member noted that in 2020 the Mexican economy may register its greatest contraction since the Great Depression.",
        "All members agreed that the balance of risks to growth is significantly biased to the downside.",
        "Most members stated that this balance is characterized by high uncertainty, given that the duration and depth of the pandemic are uncertain.",
        "In this respect, one member mentioned that this recession will considerably affect the labor market, production and practically all sectors of the economy.",
        "Another member mentioned the following among the main risks: i) that the impact on production is prolonged; ii) lower incomes and a greater impact on employment, and iii) a sharp contagion phase that would significantly affect all sectors of economic activity and the income of both private and public sectors, leading to a deterioration of credit risk, which could lead to financial and solvency problems.",
        "One member added that the effects of the pandemic could worsen if the economic policies aimed at mitigating them are insufficient.",
        "Some members mentioned that there is uncertainty about the strength of the recovery, once it begins.",
        "One member mentioned that if the expectation that the US economy will recover relatively fast in 2021 materializes, it should contribute to strengthen Mexico’s economic activity, although that would depend on the degree to which the initial economic weakness affects productive capacity and the financial system.",
        "He/she emphasized that the latter highlights the importance of implementing measures in different spheres aimed at supporting them.",
        "He/she warned that available evidence is insufficient to assess with adequate confidence margins the future trajectory of domestic production activity.",
        "Most members agreed that slack conditions are widening considerably and that the effects of the pandemic will significantly widen the negative output gap.",
        "One member estimated that this gap will be much wider during the present and the following year as compared to what was contemplated a few weeks ago.",
        "Another member considered that this will imply lower inflationary pressures.",
        "All members highlighted the recent decline in headline inflation, stressing that it was largely due to a reduction in its non-core component.",
        "One member noted that deflation was observed in March with respect to February, a phenomenon that had not been observed in such a period in Mexico’s recent history.",
        "Most members considered that the decline in non-core inflation was mainly due to the fall in energy prices.",
        "Some members mentioned that agricultural and livestock product prices increased.",
        "However, one member considered that these increases will be transitory because this type of shocks fade after a few months, and because said products currently experience a greater retail demand as a result of the social isolation measures.",
        "As for core inflation, most members stated that it decreased slightly in March.",
        "One member pointed out that the monthly change in this component was lower than the average change in recent years, although another one highlighted that the rates of growth of prices in certain items remain above 4.5%.",
        "With regards to inflation expectations, one member noted that these have still not changed considerably as a result of the pandemic.",
        "He/she stated that expectations drawn from surveys remain anchored at levels close to 3.5%, both for different definitions and different terms.",
        "Some members indicated that medium-term expectations continue above target.",
        "Meanwhile, one member mentioned that breakeven inflation has decreased.",
        "Most members mentioned that headline inflation is likely to decline in the short term.",
        "Said members mentioned that this decrease will basically stem from the lower gasoline prices.",
        "Some members noted that it will also result from a lower core inflation.",
        "One member pointed out that the latter could partly result from the effect of the pandemic on items such as tourism services.",
        "Another member stated that annual inflation is foreseen to decrease once more and lie below the target at the end of April.",
        "One member noted that during the next months it will remain close to or even below the target.",
        "Some members mentioned that, although different factors can affect headline inflation at different moments, it is expected to converge to Banco de México’s target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates.",
        "As for the risks to inflation, most members argued that these are associated to the effects of the pandemic on the economy and that inflation would be subject to both upward and downward pressures.",
        "First, they highlighted the downward pressures caused by the widening of the negative output gap and, in the short term, by lower energy prices.",
        "One member stated that the fall in these prices tends to have lasting direct and indirect effects on inflation.",
        "Another member asserted that social distancing is already disrupting the provision of certain services, and that their price variations could decrease.",
        "Second, most members mentioned the upward pressures stemming from the peso exchange rate depreciation, which will depend on its magnitude and persistence.",
        "Some members mentioned that in the short term the supply shocks derived from the impact on the supply chains and, in general, from production disruptions, would exercise upward pressures on inflation.",
        "One member estimated that these likely upward pressures have been more than offset by the above referred downward pressures.",
        "Another member expressed that the upward adjustment in the peso exchange rate will have a relatively limited impact on inflation, considering what multiple studies suggest.",
        "He/she considered that, in such a complex situation as the current one, upward risks to inflation should not be overestimated, in particular, those associated to the exchange rate.",
        "Most members indicated that uncertainty as to the balance of risks for inflation has increased significantly.",
        "Some of them pointed out that an uncertain environment for inflation prevails especially in the long term.",
        "One member noted that the uncertainty is associated to: i) possible changes in consumption patterns and their effects on price formation; ii) the magnitude and duration of shocks; iii) the persistence of adverse conditions in the financial markets; iv) the effects of disruptions in global value chains and a possible shortage of certain goods, and v) possible second round effects in case the exchange rate depreciation is perceived to be permanent.",
        "Another member stated that, although he/she agrees that the net effect of the recent shocks on inflation is uncertain, given the scale of the expected fall in output, the probability that the demand shock will prevail has increased, although in an environment characterized by significant risks.",
        "One member considered that the balance of risks for inflation in Mexico is clearly biased to the downside.",
        "Another member specified that this balance is biased to the downside in the short term.",
        "He/she underlined that uncertainty prevails in the medium and long terms as a result of the following: i) the price index loses relevance given that there is a sector of the economy that is unable to consume freely; ii) it is unknown what the price dynamics will be once the lockdown measures are raised; iii) a significant percentage of the decline in inflation is due to the non-core component, which could revert, and iv) medium-term inflation expectations remain above the target.",
        "He/she mentioned as an additional factor the loss of efficiency in measuring inflation and other economic indicators, due to data collection problems generated by the social distancing measures.",
        "He/she pointed out that although remote methods to conduct surveys are being proposed, this methodological change implies a lower quality of information and of assessment of the current juncture.",
        "Most members highlighted the deterioration of domestic financial markets generated by the shocks associated with the pandemic, while they acknowledged that a slight improvement has been recently observed, although risks to their performance continue.",
        "Some members pointed out that markets continue to exhibit a significant degree of volatility.",
        "All members underlined the depreciation of the peso exchange rate.",
        "Some members stated that, among emerging economy currencies, the Mexican peso is one of those with the greatest cumulative depreciation in the year.",
        "One member pointed out that, since Banco de México’s past monetary policy decision, the peso exchange rate reached a new historical high of 25.77 Mexican pesos per dollar.",
        "He/she also mentioned that trading spreads in the foreign exchange market widened to unprecedented levels.",
        "He/she stated that in the above described environment there has been a transition from a long to a short position in short-term foreign exchange instruments denominated in Mexican pesos.",
        "Another member considered that, although the depreciation of the Mexican peso exchange rate is partly explained by factors that have affected emerging economies in general, the presence of idiosyncratic factors is clear, as evidenced by the recent downgrade in the sovereign and in Pemex’s credit ratings.",
        "One member stated that the depreciation of the peso exchange rate has taken place despite the high interest rate spread with respect to the US Federal Reserve.",
        "As to fixed income markets, the majority of members mentioned that, after having increased securities have decreased, although they still remain volatile.",
        "One member pointed out that the slope of the yield curve increased, as term premia continue to reflect concerns about factors related to domestic policies.",
        "Some members highlighted that significant outflows of foreign capital were observed.",
        "One member specified that, during March, an outflow of 6 billion US dollars was observed, a figure never observed before for a single month.",
        "Most members noted that risk premia increased considerably.",
        "One member highlighted that those for 5-year credit default swaps (CDS) registered the largest increase in the year among the main emerging economies.",
        "Another member stated that these instruments halted their upward trend after Banco de México’s latest monetary policy decision.",
        "environment the domestic economy is facing resulting from the pandemic and the lower oil prices is worsened by idiosyncratic factors.",
        "In this context, most members highlighted the recent downgrade of the sovereign and Pemex’s credit rating by three agencies.",
        "The majority of members pointed out that one of them lowered the sovereign debt rating to one level above losing the investment grade and that two of them placed Pemex’s debt rating below investment grade.",
        "In this regard, one member noted that such adjustments responded to concerns regarding: i) the fall in oil prices; ii) the fragility of public finances; iii) Pemex’s financial sustainability, and iv) the weakening of institutions due to domestic policy.",
        "He/she added that although the market had already discounted these adjustments, additional sales of such assets by investors can be expected, leading to a greater tightening of Pemex and the country’s financing conditions, which could hinder economic recovery once the health emergency is over.",
        "Another member mentioned that the fall in oil prices has resulted in a reduction of Pemex’s revenues and profitability, as well as in a higher risk premia on its bonds.",
        "The majority of members highlighted the importance of fiscal measures under the current situation, although they pointed out that fiscal sustainability must not be jeopardized.",
        "In this regard, one member mentioned that there is a reduced margin due to the fragility of both public finances and Pemex, as reflected by the credit rating downgrades observed in the last few days.",
        "Another member pointed out that fiscal measures that address the effects of the sanitary emergency and support micro, small-, and medium-size firms and the lowest income households are imperative.",
        "He/she added that, for this purpose, a reassessment of the priorities is necessary as well as the implementation of schemes that allow for a greater participation of the private sector in public investment projects with high social and economic returns.",
        "One member considered that currently there is a limited margin to negotiate additional debt issuances.",
        "He/she mentioned that there is room for flexibility in monetary policy and thus reduce the government’s financial cost.",
        "He/she mentioned that, only in 2019, the interest, commissions and expenses on the public sector’s debt amounted to 900 billion pesos, that is, nearly 4% of GDP.",
        "He/she concluded that reductions in the monetary policy rate might also contribute to the health of public finances by liberating space to increase public debt and therefore stimulate the economy.",
        "In light of an adverse situation as the currently faced, most members highlighted the importance fundamentals and adopting actions that promote a better adjustment of financial markets and of the economy overall.",
        "Similarly they noted that in this environment, it is essential to generate public policies that guarantee certainty for private investment.",
        "In this regard, said members expressed their concerns about the deterioration of the rule of law and the persistent insecurity, which leads to an unfavorable environment for investment.",
        "Some members noted that the external shocks worsened the problems that were already underway, which were mainly the result of the lack of confidence stemming from public policy decisions, of the deterioration of the rule of law, the institutional framework and public security.",
        "One member mentioned that March was the most violent of the last There is no productive apparatus that can withstand insecurity conditions of such magnitude; it is an imperative agenda that must be addressed in order to reactivate the economy.",
        "In this regard, he/she mentioned that no fiscal or monetary policy measure will be able to render the expected benefits if there is no confidence to invest.",
        "Another member considered that all of the above factors, along with the perception of insufficient fiscal efforts to face the external shocks, have contributed to undermine the environment for private investment and have increased doubts regarding the country’s growth potential over the next years and its implications for public finances.",
        "He/she highlighted that this situation is further worsened by concerns over the uncertain outlook for Pemex and the possible depletion of resources from the Budget Revenue Stabilization Fund (FEIP) in the near future, raising investors’ doubts about the viability of maintaining the investment grade status for sovereign debt.",
        "He/she stated that a deep reorientation of the economic strategy is fundamental to overcome the current crisis and strengthen the country’s growth outlook in the long term.",
        "In light of the COVID-19 pandemic’s expected impact on inflation, economic activity and financial conditions, all members agreed on lowering the overnight interbank interest rate by 50 basis points to 6%.",
        "Similarly, they agreed on implementing additional measures to foster an orderly behavior of financial markets, strengthen the channels of credit provision in the economy, and provide liquidity for the sound development of the financial system.",
        "Most members pointed out the importance of providing a timely One member stated that the trade-offs associated with the inflation outlook should be assessed in an environment that, although being uncertain as to the magnitude and persistence of the shocks it is subject to, it will clearly register a significant economic contraction.",
        "Another member pointed out that, considering the balance of factors affecting inflation and, in particular, the higher probability that the demand-related shock on inflation will prevail over others that operate in the opposite direction, a lower policy rate is consistent with the convergence of inflation to the 3% target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates.",
        "He/she also considered that the proposed reduction will allow for an adequate balance between the margins that have become available for monetary policy and the risks that continue to be observed.",
        "One member added the importance of communicating clearly that given the observed inflation the main purpose of lowering the policy rate is to support the functioning of financial markets in face of the uncertainty and volatility generated by the pandemic, and that its main objective is other than to foster consumption and investment.",
        "Another member pointed out that, in an environment where slack conditions are widening, the expected rate of return on capital is lower, and, to avoid distortions in the credit market, it is convenient that the rate at which investment projects are financed is adjusted downwards, which calls for easing monetary policy.",
        "He/she noted that the above would improve financial conditions, which is a necessary although not sufficient condition to reactivate credit.",
        "He/she also stated that even though the relative monetary policy stance is only slightly restrictive, despite the high interest rate spread with the United States, the absolute policy stance is above the shortterm neutral rate, when it should already be below it.",
        "Some members considered that the upward adjustment in country risk indicators shows that the relative monetary policy stance does not have an ample margin, as often believed.",
        "One member added that the increase in capital outflows also suggests that said margin is not ample.",
        "Another member added that monetary conditions in several economies have eased considerably, and thus the relative monetary policy stance remains wide vis-àvis other economies, including those emerging economies that have a higher credit risk than Mexico’s.",
        "Nevertheless, he/she mentioned that, in light of the magnitude of the shock on economic activity and the increase in risk aversion, interest rate spreads have not been determinant in the portfolio adjustments observed.",
        "He/she highlighted that even the currencies and instruments with more liquid and deeper markets may have registered higher capital outflows.",
        "However, the same member emphasized that, as risk appetite normalizes, interest rate spreads may be more relevant.",
        "One member pointed out that at this moment domestic financial markets are being mostly affected by investors’ concerns regarding the weak performance of real economic activity, and to a lesser extent by interest rate spreads.",
        "He/she stated that so far this year the Mexican peso has been one of the currencies with the worst performance despite the high interest rate spread between Mexico and the US Federal Reserve.",
        "He/she added that the foreign exchange depreciation in economies with low interest rate spreads has been smaller than in economies with high interest rate spreads.",
        "He/she argued that this could be reflecting investors’ expectations about the accommodative monetary policy in the former economies allowing them to have a faster recovery and a lower contraction of real economic activity.",
        "He/she pointed out that an argument in favor of maintaining a high interest rate spread is to note that the volatility-adjusted spread has decreased.",
        "Nevertheless, he/she added that considering that exchange rate volatility might be partly the result of the high interest rates and their impact on economic activity, the recent behavior of the foreign exchange spread calls precisely for the opposite action, i.e., to promote an even greater reduction of interest rate spreads.",
        "In the same regard, he/she mentioned that the higher risk premia observed does not limit the margin for lowering the monetary policy rate and rather constitutes an additional reason for continuing to do so, as a substantial reduction would allow to offset the effect of the higher risk premia by maintaining or even lowering the cost of credit to firms.",
        "He/she added that in light of the capital outflows registered over the last weeks, concerns about monetary policy easing likely propitiating a significant depreciation of the peso exchange rate must be ruled out.",
        "He/she stated that other Latin American economies have significantly lowered their interest rate spreads, without this having implied greater depreciations than the Mexican peso’s.",
        "He/she also noted that the decision to lower the monetary policy rate by 50 basis points in March had positive effects on financial markets.",
        "Said member mentioned that interest rates of government securities decreased for all terms.",
        "He/she stated that when a monetary policy easing is perceived as a risk for inflation, long-term interest rates tend to increase reflecting the upward adjustment in inflation expectations.",
        "For this reason, he/she argued that the recent behavior of interest rates reflects that the market is not anticipating inflationary pressures associated with a less restrictive monetary policy stance.",
        "He/she pointed out that there is a wide room to continue lowering the policy rate, favoring financial markets and without generating inflationary pressures.",
        "Most members agreed that monetary policy by itself will not be able to solve the difficulties generated by the shocks that are affecting the economy.",
        "One member argued that the credit channel is ineffective to reactivate the economy.",
        "He/she highlighted that Banco de México is most willing to contribute to face this pandemic, within the limits allowed by its institutional framework, without undermining its primary objective or independence, and maintaining its credibility.",
        "Another member added that, although the measures of monetary policy easing are essential in the current context, overcoming the crisis requires adequate public health and fiscal actions.",
        "He/she added that monetary policy can only contribute to long-term economic growth by generating the conditions for macroeconomic stability.",
        "He/she noted that its impact on economic activity is modest even throughout the cycle, due to the characteristics of the Mexican financial system.",
        "He/she also emphasized that, when facing shocks like the current one, monetary policy has limitations to mitigate the fluctuations of economic activity.",
        "He/she stated that a set of policies aimed at fostering both an adequate environment for private investment and productivity growth are needed to boost economic growth.",
        "One member considered wrong to believe that low interest rates cannot contribute to the economic recovery.",
        "He/she added that the cost and access to credit for micro, small- and medium-size firms, which are those that generate most of the jobs and which will be the most affected by the pandemic, would be highly favored by a significant reduction in interest rates.",
        "He/she argued that fiscal policy could also contribute to this; however, if the government's borrowing costs remain high, the room for implementing a fiscal stimulus would be limited.",
        "He/she considered that high interest rates affect the health of public finances by increasing their financial cost.",
        "However, he/she mentioned that there is room for flexibility in monetary policy and thus to reduce the government's financial cost.",
        "The majority of members pointed out that the outlook for monetary policy remains complex.",
        "The majority highlighted the combination of a sharp contraction of economic activity, both upward and downward pressures on inflation, and volatility in financial markets.",
        "One member highlighted the importance of identifying the different dilemmas that monetary policy faces, of monitoring the scenarios that materialize, and defining the most convenient monetary policy adjustments.",
        "Some members underlined the importance of having more timely data to monitor which scenarios will materialize.",
        "Most members pointed out the importance of Banco de México acting with prudence.",
        "One member indicated that some risks associated with public finances and Pemex’s financial situation have materialized and thus that it is necessary to act with caution.",
        "Another member mentioned that given the expected trends, there are conditions to consider a further monetary policy easing, even in the short term.",
        "However, due to the risks for inflation and the high volatility in the financial markets, it will be necessary to proceed with caution.",
        "One member indicated that several risk factors prevail that could have negative consequences on the credibility of the central bank’s commitment to the inflation target.",
        "He/she stated that given the economic emergency and the current level of inflation, the emphasis must be set upon providing the necessary liquidity and prevent any affectations to financial stability.",
        "Another member mentioned that, under the present situation, the most prudent monetary policy is to substantially lower the policy rate, so that the real interest rate is below its neutral level as soon as possible, without discarding the possibility of moving towards a real rate close to zero or even negative.",
        "He/she added that not doing the above or postponing it for too long would be an unwise decision, as it would affect the Mexican economy at a time of economic crisis, would deteriorate financial markets, and would jeopardize price stability.",
        "All members acknowledged that the global and changed considerably over the last weeks, and that in order to respond promptly it was necessary to make a monetary policy decision out of the programmed schedule and accompany it with additional measures to foster an orderly behavior of financial markets, strengthen the channels of credit provision, and provide liquidity for the sound development of the financial system.",
        "One member argued that given the emergency, multiple economic agents, firms and households, must rely on financing sources to be able to offset the reduction in their income as a result of the social distance measures.",
        "The fall in income together with greater risk aversion, can result in a segmented financial market in which only lower-risk and large-sized issuers have access to financing.",
        "He/she highlighted that, under the current environment, the proper functioning of credit channels indeed becomes more necessary.",
        "He/she added that in a context of mandatory shutdowns in the production lines of goods and services, the reduction of interest rates may have a lesser effect on aggregate demand in the short term.",
        "In this context, he/she added that in order to strengthen the financial system and provide greater liquidity to the payment systems, it is necessary to: i) improve the functioning of financial markets, strengthening their price discovery process in a wide range of assets; ii) provide sufficient liquidity and prevent its segmentation, in order to foster the sound development of the financial system, and iii) strengthen the channels of credit provision, in order for financing to reach a wide number of creditors.",
        "In particular, through measures that i) grant more liquidity to the daily funding market at the opening of markets and to expand the collateral eligible for financing facilities; ii) expand the terms and types of instruments with which banks can carry out repo agreements with Banco de México, in order to provide more liquidity and strengthen the secondary market of said securities, as well as to carry out operations aimed at promoting a better functioning of the government securities’ yield curve, and iii) provide resources to banks so that they can grant credit to micro, small- and medium-size firms, as well as to households affected by the pandemic.",
        "Another member underlined that by enabling the financial system to fulfil its role in mobilizing loanable funds, these measures will help the economy to absorb the real shock of the pandemic in an orderly manner.",
        "One member highlighted that such measures are necessary given the volatility registered by domestic financial markets.",
        "In this regard, he/she mentioned that these actions would help to improve trading conditions in the fixed income market, which have deteriorated significantly despite the generalized decreases in the yields on government securities.",
        "The same member pointed out that in light of a crisis like the current one, the central bank must act on several fronts to contribute to preserve financial stability conditions and incentivize the expansion of banking credit which, besides alleviating the impact of the pandemic, support the strengthening of confidence.",
        "Another member stated that prior to the measures announced in this monetary policy decision, other actions had already been taken such as reducing the monetary regulation deposit and making some credit facilities more flexible, in addition to increasing financing in foreign currency by taking advantage of the credit swap line with the US Federal Reserve.",
        "He/she mentioned that some of the actions of the new package aim at expanding the collateral eligible for accessing liquidity facilities and for widening the coverage to development banks.",
        "He/she also pointed out that the package includes measures to strengthen the credit channels and the programs carried out jointly with the Ministry of Finance to ensure the proper functioning of the bond market, in order to improve the banking sector’s positioning given the large amount of capital outflows.",

        "He/she added that the complex situation demands implementing decisive actions, many of which are unprecedented.",
        "He/she stated that, despite these measures, the fall in economic activity is so deep and complicated that it may reveal or exacerbate existing structural flaws.",
        "Thus, this extraordinary situation requires acting more boldly and far beyond the traditional schemes.",

        "Some members mentioned that the pandemic has strongly affected the public health systems and social dynamics.",
        "Some argued that the possibility of a global recession in 2020 has increased, while one pointed out that, in general, a recovery is expected for next year.",
        "One member considered that, given the magnitude of the shock and the impact that has already been reflected in some economic indicators, a significant contraction is foreseeable during the first quarter of 2020, which could continue into the next quarter.",
        "Another member considered that the length and depth of the recession would depend on the duration of the suspension of activities.",
        "One member mentioned that the variation in the magnitude of the revisions to growth forecasts reflects the uncertainty regarding the intensity, duration and consequences of the impact.",
        "Among the risks to world economic activity, most members highlighted a greater-than-expected spread of COVID-19.",

        "All members mentioned that the prices of commodities, especially of crude oil, have plummeted.",
        "Most members underlined that this is due to the observed and anticipated reduction in demand and to disputes among the main oil producers.",
        "One member stated that headline and core inflation in advanced economies are expected to decline, due to the economic weakness and to the lower prices of primary goods.",
        "He/she mentioned that inflation in emerging economies could benefit from these factors, although it could also be affected to the upside by the depreciation of their exchange rates.",
        "Given the described environment, all members mentioned that different central banks in advanced and emerging economies lowered their interest rates, in some cases ahead of schedule.",
        "Most members mentioned that the US Federal Reserve held two unscheduled meetings, in which it cut the federal funds rate by a total of 150 basis points, down to a range of 0-0.25%.",
        "Such members pointed out that, globally, other extraordinary monetary measures have also been implemented to mitigate the effects of the expected fall in domestic and external demand, and to guarantee the well-functioning of financial measures to provide liquidity and incentivize credit, as well as the purchase programs of the following assets: i) government bonds; ii) bonds; iv) non-financial firms’ commercial papers; v) equity funds, and vi) real estate investment funds.",

        "However, one member pointed out that the announced measures have failed to alleviate the nervousness among investors, which makes it essential to have firm and integral policies, capable of coordinating both fiscal and monetary efforts that guarantee income and employment in strategic sectors, and that are perceived as sufficient to reverse the shock on economic activity.",
        "In this context, all members highlighted the significant deterioration of international financial markets, underlining the greater volatility and risk aversion.",
        "Some members indicated that the above is due to the uncertainty regarding the length of the pandemic and the extent of its effects.",
        "Most members added that it is also the result of the fall in oil prices.",
        "Some members mentioned that the deterioration of international markets is comparable to that observed during the 2009 global financial crisis.",

        "Most members mentioned that timely information released prior to the pandemic-related events shows that domestic economic activity has remained weak.",

        "He/she added that businesses will face significant challenges such as lower revenues and high uncertainty regarding the demand for their goods and services, which can generate solvency and unemployment problems.",

        "Some members considered that economic slack has increased.",
        "In view of the deteriorated growth outlook, most members mentioned that an even greater- than-anticipated widening of slack conditions is Most members mentioned that, between January and February, headline inflation increased, mainly due to a rebound in the non-core component.",
        "One member indicated that the latter was due to the comparison base effect and to pressures on agricultural and livestock product prices.",
        "Another member stated that the increase in the non-core index was anticipated, given expectations that the fall in agricultural and livestock product prices observed in 2019 would revert.",
        "As to the core component, some members highlighted that it has shown persistence.",
        "One member argued that this confirms that, despite the greater slack, other factors, such as wage increases, have prevented it from decreasing.",
        "Meanwhile, another member pointed out that this component remained on a slightly declining trend.",
        "He/she added that food merchandise inflation decreased after the increase observed in January, as a result of an adjustment to the Excise Tax (IEPS, for its acronym in Spanish), and that services inflation continued to decline.",
        "Some members indicated that although inflation is expected to continue its trend to Banco de México’s target in the time frame in which monetary policy operates, it could be slower and is subject to important risks, both to the upside and to the downside.",
        "One member stated that, in view of the deterioration of global and domestic conditions, inflation forecasts are subject to high uncertainty.",
        "Another member considered that the combination of supply and demand shocks, as well as higher uncertainty, will probably result in upward pressures on inflation in 2020.",
        "As for inflation risks, most members mentioned that the expected widening of the negative output gap and the fall in international energy prices could imply downward inflation pressures.",
        "Nonetheless, such members considered that this could be offset by the upward pressure the peso exchange rate depreciation might exert on prices.",
        "One member argued that, even if the depreciation persists, it would occur in a context of economic contraction.",
        "He/she mentioned that the pass-through to prices will depend on the persistence of the exchange rate adjustment and on the economy’s cyclical position.",
        "Among upward risks for inflation, some members mentioned the pressures stemming from the disruption of global value chains and from the shortage of certain goods as a result of the suspension of activities.",
        "One member mentioned that a key price in the future developments of inflation is gasoline prices.",
        "He/she indicated that the international reference has declined by a greater percentage than the exchange rate depreciation, and thus the price of gasoline in Mexican pesos should decrease.",
        "He/she stated that this has already started to take place in different parts of the country.",
        "He/she added that, given its contribution to headline inflation and its role in the determination of other prices, the fall in energy prices would become an important downward bias for inflation.",
        "In this context, some members considered that the uncertainty over the balance of risks for inflation has intensified.",
        "One member highlighted that, given the complex environment, both upward and downward risks have increased.",
        "Another member stated that there is uncertainty over the magnitude and the duration of different supply and demand shocks, as well as over the persistence of adverse conditions in financial markets, and therefore their effect on inflation in the short, medium and long terms is uncertain.",
        "One member considered that the balance of risks is biased to the upside.",
        "Another one mentioned that it is slightly biased to the downside due to the following: i) the shock on agricultural and livestock product prices usually fades in a few months; ii) the fall in energy prices; and iii) although the peso exchange rate has depreciated, commodity prices and the fall in aggregate demand will end up exerting a greater influence on inflation.",
        "In an environment of greater risk aversion worldwide, most members highlighted that domestic financial markets exhibited a negative performance.",
        "Some members underlined the deterioration of trading conditions in these markets.",
        "In this context, all members noted that the peso exchange rate depreciated significantly.",
        "One member mentioned that this is explained by several factors, such as the greater risk aversion and the fall in oil prices, which also affected the exchange rate of other oil-exporting countries’ currencies.",
        "Some members added that this depreciation was greater than that observed in most emerging economies and one member added that the depreciation of the peso exchange rate vis-à-vis other emerging currencies reflects idiosyncratic factors, such as the concerns regarding Pemex and public finances, as well as the respective credit ratings, and that other risks such as those stemming from the US elections persist.",
        "The majority of members pointed out that interest significantly for all terms.",
        "One member added that over the last weeks, outflows by foreign investors have increased importantly.",
        "Some members highlighted that the stock market fell considerably.",
        "Most members noted that risk premia increased sharply.",
        "One member stated that the dramatic fall in oil prices contributed to such an increase, and thus Pemex continues to be a significant risk factor for public finances and raises an alarm regarding the possibility of a downgrade to the sovereign’s credit rating in the near future.",
        "The majority explained that, although interest rate spreads between Mexico and the United States widened, after adjusting for FX volatility, they have in fact been Most members mentioned the possibility of implementing fiscal measures to address the needs of the health sector and support the population, firms and sectors that are most affected.",
        "Some members stated that, given the constraints that public finances face, the above is subject to a reallocation of public spending that carefully considers the priorities to allocate resources to.",
        "Some members argued that an option for the government is to use the sources of extraordinary revenues at its disposal, which would enable it to meet the public balance target.",
        "One member added the possibility of postponing the primary surplus target at least for this year and stated that both options would imply a greater debt-to-GDP ratio.",
        "He/she emphasized that fiscal policy faces the dilemma between acting or not and the need to meet its fiscal targets or not.",
        "Another member noted that, in response to the contingency, increased spending would exert greater pressure on public finances, which already are in a vulnerable situation, and thus the possibility of a countercyclical fiscal support package should necessarily be accompanied by a reassessment of priorities that allows for an efficient allocation of available resources immediately to the needs of the health sector, and, at a later stage, to the reactivation of economic activity in the strategic sectors affected, firms, and families, as well as to a vigorous public investment.",
        "The majority of members warned that both the fall in oil prices and the lower economic growth increase fiscal accounts’ vulnerability.",
        "In this context, they highlighted the importance of maintaining the sustainability of public finances.",
        "One member added that this would be achieved with measures that boost economic growth.",
        "Most members pointed out that the already weak financial situation of Pemex became more complex due to the fall in oil prices.",
        "One member noted that an assessment of its current projects and a greater financial support by the federal government cannot be ruled out.",
        "Another member mentioned that, in light of the current juncture, Pemex’s business plan should be re-assessed.",
        "The majority emphasized that the situation of Pemex is a risk factor for public finances, underlining the possibility of a downgrading of both the sovereign and the State-owned company’s credit rating.",
        "One member stated that yield spreads on Pemex bonds have already increased considerably.",
        "Finally, some members pointed out that solving Pemex’s problems should be given special attention at this moment.",
        "Given an adverse juncture as the current one, the majority of members highlighted the importance fundamentals and adopting actions that foster a better adjustment of financial markets and of the economy overall.",
        "Similarly, they pointed out that, in an environment as the one described above, it is even more relevant to generate public policies that provide certainty to private investment.",
        "In this regard, some members warned that it is important to avoid changing the rules for already made investments.",
        "They expressed concern about the impact on investment confidence of the scheduled public consultation to authorize the operations of a brewery, whose construction is already 80% completed.",
        "Such members added that, if the project is cancelled, the negative effect on the business climate would be even greater.",
        "One member added that the controversies in 2019 regarding gas pipeline contracts awarded to the private sector increased the negative sentiment among investors.",
        "He/she argued that no monetary or fiscal measure would have the expected benefits if there is no confidence to invest.",
        "Some members noted the concerns of the private sector regarding the prevailing challenges in terms of legal certainty, insecurity, and public policies’ clarity.",
        "As for growth in the medium and long term, one member argued that: i) strengthening the rule of law; ii) increasing economic productivity; and, iii) promoting actions that improve confidence and investment expectations are essential.",
        "Given the foreseen impact of the shocks stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, most members decided to move forward the date of the monetary policy announcement from March 26 to 20 and lower the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 50 basis points to 6.5%, as well as to adopt other measures to provide liquidity and improve the functioning of domestic financial markets.",
        "One member voted for lowering the target to 6.75%.",
        "One member added that all available tools to fulfill the constitutional mandate of preserving the peso’s purchasing power and ensuring the well-functioning of financial markets and payment systems must be used.",
        "The majority of members pointed out that, considering the risks implied by the COVID-19 monetary policy.",
        "In this regard, they highlighted that the economic outlook has deteriorated significantly, while the peso exchange rate has depreciated considerably, in an environment where risk premia and volatility in financial markets have increased.",
        "One member stated that, in light of the complex environment, the monetary policy decision must assess the trade-offs associated with the inflation outlook in an environment in which, despite the uncertainty as to the extent and persistence of the shocks it is subject to, it is highly likely that a significant economic contraction and recession occurs.",
        "He/she added that the above takes place in a context where the monetary conditions in the major economies have eased considerably, and such economies have adopted a broad range of stimuli to revert the deterioration of their financing conditions.",
        "He/she also noted that the situation of the current monetary policy stance should also be considered, as such stance, despite having faced other shocks and their inflationary effects over the last years, and albeit being already in a downward adjustment process, is still at relatively high levels, in an economy that, in face of the COVID-19 pandemic, will suffer a very sizable impact that will lead it to a significant recession.",
        "He/she mentioned that, additionally, the financial shock also associated with the pandemic may imply upward risks for the price formation process due to the pressures associated with the depreciation of the peso exchange rate.",
        "In this regard, he/she highlighted that its pass-through to prices will depend on the persistence of the foreign exchange adjustment and on the economy’s cyclical position, which is already characterized by a negative output gap that will widen considerably due to the pandemic shock.",
        "Most members considered that, in light of the higher risk premia, the relative monetary policy stance may not have such an ample margin as may be perceived.",
        "One member argued that, despite the greater volatility and higher risk premia, the relative monetary policy stance still has certain room for maneuver; however, he/she acknowledged that the absolute monetary policy stance is close to the neutral rate.",
        "Some members highlighted that the Mexican peso has a high level of sensitivity due to its use as a hedge currency and, therefore, it should be taken into account that lowering short-term interest rates in Mexico reduces the cost of this type of transactions.",
        "One member pointed out that given an environment of foreign exchange instability, a greater interest rate spread is needed, which implies acting with extreme caution.",
        "One member pointed out that a standard argument in favor of high interest rates is that they are a protective mechanism against risks, which allows for a better behavior of the exchange rate and that, ultimately, contributes to macroeconomic stability.",
        "However, he/she noted that those countries with greater interest rate spreads vis-à-vis the United States were those that recently suffered the most severe exchange rate depreciations, which is evidence against the above mentioned standard argument.",
        "He/she considered that some reasons explaining the above are i) that the high interest rates attract speculative capital that, in episodes of risk aversion, is the first to exit a market and at a speed that is usually greater than that at which it entered, so a gradual process of exchange appreciation could be followed by a sudden depreciation; ii) that maintaining a high real interest rate for a prolonged period erodes the macroeconomic foundations of the country, by decreasing consumption, investment and growth, and also affects public finances, which eventually impacts sovereign risk premia.",
        "He/she added that the lack of growth affects corporate earnings, which eventually affects equity markets.",
        "He/she noted that it should not be surprising that when the global economic outlook deteriorates, the most affected currencies are the ones of those economies that maintained very restrictive monetary policies, affecting the already deteriorated economic outlook.",
        "He/she stated that the economy is at a juncture where there are very worrying signs of a deterioration of economic activity, along with a stable, or even positive, outlook for inflation.",
        "He/she considered that, although the primary objective of Banco de México is to ensure the convergence of inflation to its target, this must occur with the lowest possible costs for the economy.",
        "He/she argued that continuing to maintain an overly restrictive monetary policy stance is very costly and risks the attainment of the inflation target itself.",
        "He/she noted that, given the economic outlook, and the downward risks to inflation, the Central Bank is responsible for minimizing the costs of monetary policy on the economy, and should therefore seek to move as soon as possible towards a neutral or even slightly accommodative policy stance.",
        "He/she noted that policy rates in some Latin American economies are at historically low levels.",
        "policy’s ability to mitigate the fall in economic activity that might be observed is limited.",
        "One member argued that this is because, in Mexico, the credit channel of the monetary policy transmission mechanism is less effective due to the low level of financial inclusion and in the presence of supply shocks.",
        "Nevertheless, he/she stated that the reduction of the policy rate sends an important signal of commitment with the economic challenge that is being confronted.",
        "Another one mentioned that in light of the effect of real shocks, such as those stemming from COVID-19, the scope of action of monetary policy is centered on the policy rate and on fostering an orderly functioning of financial markets; however, it cannot by itself offset the real effects of the observed shocks.",
        "One pointed out that it is widely accepted that, in Mexico, the effect of interest rates on economic activity throughout the cycle is modest.",
        "He/she also underlined that most analysts consider that although central bank actions can reduce financial tensions, it is very unlikely that monetary policy has a relevant impact on the real sector’s cyclical trajectory to confront shocks such as the one stemming from COVID-19.",
        "He/she stated that in the present juncture it is difficult to foresee a relevant response from consumers and firms to interest rate adjustments.",
        "He/she argued that in this type of cases the implementation of measures well targeted to the most affected sectors is more effective.",
        "Most members highlighted that the policy that is the most effective in responding to the current highlighted the importance of taking measures targeted directly to the fundamental causes of the crisis, that is, the public health problem.",
        "He/she indicated that it is difficult to expect a significant reduction in market uncertainty so long as important progress in that direction is not perceived.",
        "He/she pointed out that, simultaneously, other measures must be implemented that allow the productive sector and the financial system to avoid being severely damaged, which would allow for a fast recovery once the shock fades away.",
        "This member pointed out that the magnitude and nature of the financial crisis requires actions in different fronts and that monetary policy is only an instrument, and not the most important one.",
        "He/she added that actions to strengthen confidence in the authorities’ capacity to overcome the current situation would increase monetary policy’s margin of maneuver.",
        "Some members emphasized the importance of Banco de México acting with prudence and caution.",
        "One member considered fundamental for the monetary policy statement to mention that the Central Institute will follow closely the evolution of the present juncture and, within its sphere of competence, will take actions so that the economy adjusts in an orderly way to the current conditions.",
        "Another member argued that the nature of the shocks stemming from the pandemic and the lower oil prices has relevant differences for the case of Mexico, as compared to those observed in advanced economies, which have very low inflation levels, and in most emerging economies, which have inflation levels below their respective targets.",
        "In this context, he/she mentioned that concerns for inflationary pressures are lower, or even non-existent, in these economies.",
        "In contrast, he/she noted that Mexico’s monetary policy had already been facing a very complex situation due to a stagnant or slightly contracting economic activity being observed simultaneously with a relatively high inflation rate, and a situation of high uncertainty.",
        "He/she pointed out that, with the recent shocks, the degree of complexity has increased in all of these fronts.",
        "He/she added that, in circumstances of high uncertainty, it is preferable to err on the side of prudence.",
        "He/she mentioned that a downward correction to the policy rate is less problematic than an upward one, and that under the current conditions, the potential costs of excessively decreasing interest rates are greater than those of temporarily deferring their reduction.",
        "However, he/she acknowledged that the Central Bank must take advantage of the space that becomes available to further ease monetary policy, for instance, in light of clearer evidence that the demand shock will prevail over the other shocks, and that this is consistent with the convergence of inflation to the target during the period of influence of monetary policy.",
        "He/she added that the monetary authority must be ready to act in the way and direction so required, considering that the circumstances might change rapidly in any direction.",
        "One member argued that when assessing the magnitude and speed of a downward adjustment to the policy rate that must be undertaken in the current contingency, three limiting factors must be taken into account: i) Mexico is a small and open economy that is facing an external shock and the margin offered by the world’s lax external monetary policy is uncertain considering global risk premia and the sharp depreciation of the peso exchange rate; ii) monetary policy may have moderate effects given the sharp decline of economic activity under the current juncture; and iii) medium-term considerations of guaranteeing the convergence to the inflation target, given a balance of risks for inflation to the upside.",
        "Delving into said limiting factors, he/she pointed out that the Mexican economy currently faces an aggregate shock that has generated a reallocation of flows towards lower risk assets and currencies, and therefore an excessive reduction of the policy rate could exacerbate this phenomenon.",
        "He/she mentioned that the IMF recommends lowering interest rates to the extent possible and emphasizing forward guidance on the expected pattern of monetary policy.",
        "He/she underlined that, for emerging economies, this institution also recommends a balance between fostering growth and the evident need for liquidity to face external pressures.",
        "He/she added that this is the case of the Mexican economy, which by being linked to external markets, is more susceptible to adjustments in risk aversion.",
        "He/she underlined that the recent increases in this indicator have contributed to the significant depreciation of the peso exchange rate.",
        "In this regard, such member warned that even when econometric estimates suggest that the exchange rate pass-through to inflation is very low, the current levels of the peso exchange rate could affect inflation expectations.",
        "He/she also included the worsening of public finances as an additional risk factor that must be considered.",
        "He/she elaborated on the fact that medium-term considerations together with a balance of risks for inflation to the upside prescribe some degree of prudence in the path towards a lax policy stance.",
        "Such member mentioned that it is necessary to have a medium-term strategy that considers both a balance of risks for inflation to the upside and the postponing of the convergence to the target, as it already occurred and was mentioned in the Quarterly Report October-December 2019.",
        "He/she pointed out that the unanchoring of inflation expectations must be avoided.",
        "In this regard, he/she considered that an excessive easing would send a wrong signal for the formation of inflation expectations, and might compromise the convergence of inflation to the target.",
        "Nevertheless, he/she also mentioned that the emergency situation that is being faced with the current pandemic suggest putting less emphasis in meeting the point inflation target in the short run.",
        "Considering these limiting factors, this member indicated that the situation of crisis and emergency suggests that a significant reduction in the policy rate would be desirable.",
        "Nevertheless, in the proposal for the adjustment of the policy rate, he/she considered attaining a greater consensus in order to send a much clearer signal.",
        "He/she pointed out that a greater deterioration of financial markets will be considered in order to assess the need for implementing additional measures if required.",

        "Another member stated that given the worsening of financial markets and the risks associated for the instrumentation of monetary policy and financial stability, Banco de México needs to act promptly, and underlined the following actions: i) lowering the target rate; ii) complementary measures to improve liquidity conditions, allowing financial institutions to offset the external pressures and prevent disequilibria in their balances or involuntary increases in their risk exposures; iii) additional measures to foster an adequate functioning of financial markets, and iv) moving the monetary policy decision forward as much as possible with the implicit message of urgency and of emergency in response the crisis induced by the coronavirus.",
        "He/she mentioned that by guaranteeing liquidity in financial markets, the aim is to support aggregate demand determinants as well as consumers and firms’ confidence.",
        "Thus, with these measures, a healthy behavior of the financial system is fostered.",
        "One member stated that now is the time to consider asset purchase programs like those adopted by other central banks.",
        "He/she mentioned that the latter makes sense given that part of the instability is due to the fall in oil prices originated by the combination of supply and demand shocks, where at least one of them is transitory.",
        "He/she added that the loss of value of some critical assets and the corresponding destruction of collateral must be avoided.",
        "He/she also mentioned that, under the current conditions, the measures to provide liquidity contribute to make more effective the transmission of monetary policy easing to the real economy.",
        "Most members stated that actions to improve the well-functioning of markets had already been adopted in previous days.",
        "In particular, they pointed out that on March 9[th], the Foreign Exchange Commission increased the size of its foreign exchange peso hedge program and auctions were carried out on March 12[th] and 18[th].",
        "One member mentioned that these measures were taken to improve trading and liquidity conditions in the foreign exchange market and not based on the level of the peso exchange rate.",
        "Some members added that on March 19[th], Banco de México announced the establishment of currency swap lines with the US Federal Reserve for up to 60 billion US dollars, for at least 6 months.",
        "One member stated that these swap lines are mutual and temporary mechanisms similar to those agreed between the US Federal Reserve and other central banks, including Banco de México, in 2008.",
        "He/she highlighted some of the benefits of the proposed measures: i) US dollar auctions contribute to a better functioning of the foreign exchange rate market, preventing possible distortions in US dollar financing, using the currency swap line agreed with the Federal Reserve; ii) the reduction in the cost of collateralized financing of more than twice the funding rate to one slightly above the funding rate, increases the peso-financing alternatives for the banking system; iii) the reduction of the monetary regulation deposit increases the availability of resources for commercial and development banks to address the additional financing requirements of households and firms; moreover, it offers important benefits by being implemented directly and implying a reduction of Central Bank liabilities rather than an increase in its lending; iv) the strengthening of the market makers program, which is a program sponsored by the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit and in which Banco de México participates as a financial agent, may offer market makers new alternatives to better manage their holdings of securities as well as additional incentives to purchase securities, thus improving operations in the government securities market and the conditions to buy/sell securities.",
        "Considering the risks for inflation, economic activity and financial markets implied by the COVID-19 pandemic, significant challenges arise for monetary policy and for the economy in general.",
        "In light of the foreseen implications, with the presence of all its members, Banco de México’s Governing Board decided by majority to lower the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 50 basis points to The Governing Board will take the necessary actions on the basis of incoming information so that the policy rate is consistent with the orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to Banco de México’s target in the time frame in which monetary policy operates.",
        "Perseverance in strengthening the macroeconomic fundamentals and in adopting the necessary actions, regarding both monetary and fiscal policies, will contribute to a successful adjustment of domestic financial markets and of the economy as a whole.",
        "Alejandro Díaz de León-Carrillo, Irene EspinosaCantellano, Gerardo Esquivel-Hernández, and Jonathan Ernest Heath-Constable voted in favor of lowering the overnight interbank interest rate by 50 basis points to 6.5%.",
        "Javier Eduardo Guzmán-Calafell voted in favor of lowering the overnight interbank interest rate by 25 basis points to 6.75%.",
        "The COVID-19 pandemic, together with the fall in international oil prices, have increased the already complex challenges of monetary policy by exerting pressures in opposite directions for inflation and by raising uncertainty, as reflected in the latter’s case by the peso exchange rate having undergone the greatest depreciation among emerging market currencies since mid-February.",
        "This situation, along with other domestic and external challenges, demand that monetary policy be implemented prudently, and taking into consideration that the impact of the interest rate on economic activity, modest for Mexico according to numerous calculations, is even more limited in the presence of shocks such as the one currently faced.",
        "With a diffuse scenario for inflation and a high level of nervousness in financial markets, I believe that lowering the policy rate by 25 basis points is preferable.",
        "In a rapidly changing environment, monetary policy must adjust at the time and in the magnitude required, and the Central Bank must continue to foster orderly conditions in domestic financial markets and in the foreign exchange market.",

        "Another member mentioned that production shutdowns have a larger effect on economies that are more open and integrated to global value chains, because the different phases of the pandemic hinder synchronized production, as well as tourismdependent regions.",
        "He/she mentioned that economies’ external demand has been affected by such situation, while domestic demand has been affected by lower households and firms’ income which, in addition to the lockdown measures, has reduced spending.",
        "He/she added that all of the above is leading to a significant fall in employment, which will widen the economic contraction.",

        "Some members mentioned additional risks, such as the resurfacing of tensions between China and the United States, as well as others of political and geopolitical nature.",
        "One member highlighted the danger of a double dip recession.",
        "In this context, most members pointed out that the balance of risks for the global economic outlook remains Most members mentioned that the impact on economic activity has resulted in a sharp fall in commodity prices, especially of crude oil.",

        "One member stated that inflation expectations have decreased.",
        "Another member noted that although inflation continues to register positive figures, the possibility of additional declines, and even of episodes of deflation, represent risk factors for the recovery of the world economy.",
        "All members stated that in light of the described environment, several central banks lowered their interest rates significantly.",
        "One member pointed out that most advanced economies have nominal interest rates around 0% or negative, and that emerging economies overall set them near or below observed inflation, thus leading to real rates close to rate below or equal to 3%, five have rates between 3 and 5%, while Mexico, Russia and Turkey have rates above 5%.",
        "However, he/she stated that expected inflation for the end of the year in Russia and Turkey is high, while in Mexico it is already below 3%.",
        "For this reason, he/she mentioned that the real interest rate in Mexico is currently the highest among the group of seventeen emerging countries analyzed.",
        "He/she added that, for emerging economies, average expectations for policy rates for the end of Most members pointed out that numerous central banks have also implemented other extraordinary measures to foster the well- functioning of their financial systems.",
        "One member highlighted that practically all central banks have emphasized in their statements the need to intensify the monetary stimulus to speed up the economic recovery process.",
        "Another member added that these measures’ intent is for households and firms to be able to face their temporarily lower incomes as a result of the pandemic, as well as to avoid a credit contraction.",
        "As for the referred measures, one member underlined the risk that certain vulnerabilities that could jeopardize financial stability may arise or increase, as well as the challenges that could stem from certain legal difficulties in some regions.",
        "Most members stated that numerous countries have implemented fiscal stimulus measures to mitigate the adverse effects of the pandemic.",
        "Some members noted that such stimuli have been greater than those implemented during the global financial crisis.",
        "One member specified that various authorities have approved direct relief measures and credit-guarantee programs.",
        "Another member stressed that there is the risk that these measures are insufficient to avoid a deeper and longer than expected recession.",
        "Most members mentioned that this adverse environment has led to a greater risk aversion, a deterioration of global financial conditions, and to a recomposition of investors’ portfolios pointed out that as compared to the beginning of the year, stock markets of advanced economies have fallen considerably.",
        "One member noted that there were outflows from equity markets and high-risk corporate debt in the aforementioned economies.",

        "Some members considered that the absence of a comprehensive support approach, particularly given the modest fiscal response, can lead to a slower recovery.",

        "He/she underlined that services registered 2.84%, a level not seen since that the depreciation of the peso exchange rate has not affected the prices of non-food merchandise significantly, despite the fact that a significant share of them is imported.",
        "He/she added that housing prices registered an annual inflation of below 3%.",
        "He/she also pointed out that only two components of core inflation, education services and food merchandise prices, registered an annual inflation above that figure.",
        "Nevertheless, he/she underlined that in education services a slight decline with respect to previous months can be observed, while food merchandises are undergoing a peculiar and possibly transitory increase in their demand.",
        "In addition, production of some of these goods has been limited due to the lockdown measures, exerting upward pressures in their prices.",
        "One member stressed that, according to academic studies, the lockdown leads to radical changes in consumption patterns and that the disruption in some value chains reflects extreme changes within the price index, as shown by the increase in the subindex of food merchandise and the significant fall in tourism services prices.",
        "Most members pointed out that short-term headline inflation expectations have decreased.",
        "Some members stated that, for the end of 2020, these are slightly below 3%.",

        "Most members mentioned that medium- and long-term remained relatively stable, although above the 3% target.",

        "One member stated that there are marked contrasts for the different terms of this indicator, which highlights that it has limitations in assessing inflation expectations under circumstances like the current ones in financial markets, which are characterized by low liquidity levels and a deterioration of trading conditions overall.",
        "Most members highlighted that inflation is anticipated to converge to Banco de México’s target in the time frame in which monetary policy operates.",
        "Some members considered that inflation will be below the target by the end of the year.",
        "One member estimated that it will remain below 3% for the remainder of 2020.",
        "He/she indicated that this is supported in part by the prospects that energy prices will remain relatively low, due to a weak global demand for commodities.",
        "He/she pointed out that the increase in agricultural and livestock product prices observed in previous months has already started to reverse, and noted that prices of food products would decrease once the lockdown measures are lifted.",
        "Another member indicated that inflation is expected to increase in the following months and that it could attain levels above Banco de México’s target in the second half of the year.",
        "He/she mentioned that the recovery of energy prices will exert upward pressures on the non-core component.",
        "He/she added that core inflation would be affected by an exchange rate that is more depreciated than was foreseen, and by supply shocks.",
        "Nevertheless, he/she stressed that given the significant contraction of demand in 2020, of a recovery that is foreseen to be moderate in 2021, and of consequent expectations of a wide negative output gap for both years, it is reasonable to anticipate that headline inflation will converge to its target in 2021, in an environment of both upward and downward pressures and of high uncertainty.",
        "As to risks for inflation, most members mentioned downward pressures stemming from the considerable widening of the negative output gap and from the fall in energy prices.",
        "One member pointed out that social distancing is disrupting the provision of certain services, the price variation of which may decrease.",
        "Another member added the declines in agricultural and livestock prices and problems in measuring inflation, due to the change in the representative consumption basket during the pandemic.",
        "Among upward risks, most members emphasized the possibility of a greater or more persistent depreciation of the exchange rate and possible disruptions in production chains and in the distribution of certain goods and services.",
        "Some members highlighted the pressures on food merchandise prices.",
        "In particular, one of them emphasized that these pressures may be of such magnitude that they may exceed the effects of the economic slackness on prices.",
        "He/she added the base effect of non-core inflation due to the low levels that have been recently observed, a reversal in energy prices, and a greater pressure on agricultural and livestock product prices.",
        "Another member stated that although it has been argued that the exchange rate depreciation is an upward risk, it has not materialized in Mexico or in other emerging economies yet, in which inflation has declined.",
        "He/she added that although it has been argued that there could be cost pressures stemming from higher intermediate input prices, the IMF reported that annual inflation of commodities reached -31% in April, which represents an important deflationary force.",
        "One member pointed out that the effects of the lockdown on consumption patterns and on value chains, as well as the difficulties in collecting price data, make the reading of the price index more complicated, and that certain upward and downward pressures should therefore be analyzed carefully.",
        "In this context, most members considered that the balance of risks for inflation remains uncertain.",
        "One member noted that this derives from the following: i) possible changes in consumption patterns and their effects on the price formation process, ii) the magnitude and duration of the fall in aggregate demand, iii) the disruption in global value chains and a possible shortage of certain goods, iv) the persistence of adverse conditions in financial markets that cause disorderly adjustments, and v) possible second-order effects if the exchange rate depreciation is perceived to be permanent.",
        "Another member stated that uncertainty over the referred balance of risks is high, considering that the significant contraction in demand will exert downward pressures on inflation, while supply shocks and the exchange rate depreciation could pressure it upwards.",
        "He/she pointed out that the outcome will depend on the intensity of each of the abovementioned pressures, as well as on the interaction among them.",
        "Meanwhile, one member considered that the magnitude of the economic contraction and the consequent widening of the negative output gap ought to have a greater impact than the exchange rate on the price setting process.",
        "In this situation, he/she considered that both upward and downward risks for inflation are well-balanced.",
        "Another member considered that inflation data of April, in particular the evolution of the core inflation components and the fall in non-core inflation, suggest that downward pressures on inflation are prevailing over upward ones.",
        "Most members highlighted that unprecedented capital outflows have been registered and that foreign investors have reduced their government bond holdings by over MXN 250 billion.",
        "One member indicated that this was caused not only by the global environment, but also by idiosyncratic factors.",
        "Another member pointed out that since the previous monetary policy decision, capital outflows have continued, although at a slower pace.",
        "One member considered that the recomposition of investors’ portfolios has contributed to generate tight financial conditions.",
        "Another member highlighted that the stock of foreign investment holdings in government bonds still represents close to USD 90 billion.",
        "Most members stated that over the last weeks the performance of Mexican financial markets has improved.",
        "Nevertheless, the majority of members mentioned that deteriorated trading conditions persist.",
        "Some members indicated that debt and foreign exchange markets continue to show reduced depth and a shortage of liquidity.",
        "One member added that this has distorted interest rates in certain nodes of the yield curve.",
        "Some members mentioned that sovereign risk has adjusted slightly to the downside, although one member considered that concerns over different risk factors remain high.",
        "On the other hand, some members underlined that the stock market index increased nearly 6% in the last month.",
        "One member pointed out that marginal inflows by foreign investors to the stock market were observed.",

        "One member highlighted that during the last month interest rates decreased by over 100 basis points in some nodes of the yield curve.",
        "Another member pointed out that factors of concern, a steep yield curve, and the liquidation of positions, persist.",
        "As for the exchange rate, all members mentioned the significant depreciation observed this year.",
        "Most members underlined that it remains high, although some of them indicated that it has recently traded in a narrower range.",
        "One member pointed out that in the last few months the exchange rate has traded in a wide range and that trading spreads and intraday volatility have remained high, with unfavorable levels of liquidity and depth.",
        "In addition, he/she pointed out that in the derivatives market, a net short position in short-term instruments is maintained.",
        "He/she highlighted that the Mexican peso remains among the emerging market currencies with the highest annual depreciation.",
        "He/she added that said deterioration is similar to that observed in the 2008-2009 financial crisis and more pronounced than during the Taper Tantrum and the stated that financial conditions will continue to be subject to the outlook for the effects of the pandemic.",
        "Most members pointed out that this negative environment contributed to the downgrade of sovereign and Pemex’s credit ratings.",
        "Some members noted that two rating agencies maintained a negative outlook for Mexico.",
        "One member mentioned that they warned about further adjustments in the near future and that some market participants debate over when the sovereign will lose its investment grade rating.",
        "As to Pemex, some members expressed that it was affected by the fall in oil prices.",
        "One member mentioned that in the first quarter of the year it registered an historic loss of MXN 562 billion, and that it requires a high capitalization.",
        "He/she stated that although the exchange rate depreciation had the greatest impact on the company, its structural issues have gained relevance in the context of low oil prices, the confirmation of its loss of investment grade, and low margin for maneuver in public finances.",
        "Another member stated that the International Monetary Fund had noted that one of the main risks is the need for additional financial support for Pemex.",
        "One member pointed out that if its business model is not reformulated, Pemex will continue to draw resources from the public treasury.",
        "Most members mentioned that in view of the anticipated deficit increase and the fall in GDP, public debt is expected to increase as a fraction of GDP.",
        "One member added that this indicator will also increase due to the exchange rate depreciation.",
        "Another member mentioned that a shortfall of public revenue is foreseen for this year.",
        "He/she noted that even taking into consideration the use of resources from the Budget Revenue Stabilization Fund (FEIP), the oil hedge revenues, and a lower programmable spending, the primary deficit would amount to 0.8% of GDP.",
        "He/she mentioned that in the medium term revenue collection will depend on the recovery of public and private investment to levels above the low values registered in recent years.",
        "He/she added that the referred credit rating revisions have contributed to a greater tightening of financial conditions for both the government and Mexican firms.",
        "In this regard, he/she emphasized that recently government bonds have been issued in US dollars with an additional premia, and at a higher cost than the issuances in January.",
        "He/she added that the shortage of new issuance and of refinancing operations by the corporate sector reflects tight financial conditions and investors’ risk aversion towards Mexican issuers.",
        "In view of the current situation, most members highlighted the importance of fiscal support sustainability of public finances.",
        "In this regard, some considered that measures to support the productive apparatus and to mitigate the effects of the pandemic have been insufficient.",
        "Most members acknowledged that there is little room for maneuver due to the sovereign debt mentioned that the economic contraction and the higher deficit expected for this year limit the room for maneuver even more.",
        "One member considered that there is limited space to issue additional debt and to implement a countercyclical fiscal policy.",
        "Nevertheless, he/she noted that additional reductions in the interest rate could contribute, although to a limited extent, to reduce the financial cost of the government and to free up space for fiscal stimulus.",
        "Meanwhile, another member considered that Mexico still has good access to international markets and that the current space should be utilized.",
        "Given the limited fiscal space, most members considered that efforts should be directed to a reallocation of the budget according to efficiency reallocation should be directed towards spending with an effect on the labor market in the short term.",
        "Another member stated that there are some margins for maneuver, such as the reallocation of public spending from controversial large-scale projects to priorities arisen as a result of the pandemic.",
        "In light of an adverse juncture, most members highlighted the need to generate public policies that provide certainty to private investment, along with the importance of maintaining solid macroeconomic fundamentals.",
        "One member stated that the latter contributes to an orderly adjustment of Mexican financial markets and of the economy as a whole.",
        "He/she mentioned the need for a strategy to mitigate the negative shocks, which at the same time maintains low and stable inflation as well as a solid and well-capitalized financial system.",
        "Some members expressed their concerns about the uncertain environment for investment.",
        "In particular, they mentioned the recent modifications in the rules for private sector participation in electricity generation using renewable sources.",
        "One pointed out that this measure affects the process of competition and free market participation.",
        "He/she added that these actions come in addition to others that modified contracts’ legal conditions after investments had been made, such as the cancellation of Mexico City’s New International Airport (NAIM, for its acronym in Spanish), the Federal Electricity Commission’s (CFE, for its acronym in Spanish) litigation over gas pipelines, the cancellation of the green-energy certificate system, and the suspension of the construction works for a new brewery plant.",
        "Another member considered that the health crisis, together with idiosyncratic factors, can reduce Mexico’s potential growth to levels not seen in many years, which would imply high economic and social costs.",
        "Therefore, this calls for strengthening communication and collaboration links with the private sector in order to create an environment conducive to investment.",
        "He/she added that to overcome the challenges originated by the crisis and to foster economic growth in the long run, a balanced policy approach is required.",
        "He/she emphasized that this is important given the deterioration of economic fundamentals in Mexico.",
        "Taking into account the foreseen impacts on inflation, economic activity and financial markets resulting from COVID-19 and considering the room for maneuver that on balance these grant to monetary policy, all members agreed to lower the target for the overnight interbank interest Most members pointed out that some emerging economies that have lowered their policy rates rapidly, have suffered a depreciation of their currencies, even despite having intervened in their foreign exchange markets.",
        "One member added that in some of these economies long-term interest rates also increased, in a context in which they are decreasing in most other economies.",
        "He/she emphasized that the adoption in Mexico of a more aggressive monetary policy approach aimed at stimulating the recovery would imply incurring in high risks in exchange for a modest impact on economic activity for well-known and substantiated reasons.",
        "Another member considered that although calls for implementing more aggressive actions to ease monetary policy have emerged, following a gradual strategy is essential in view of the environment of high uncertainty and the relevance recently gained by idiosyncratic factors, which represent risks for financial and macroeconomic stability.",
        "Some members considered that the present context grants a margin for lowering the policy rate further.",
        "Some members added that lower interest rates will contribute to a more effective functioning of Banco de México’s previously announced facilities to foster credit provision.",
        "One member argued that in view of an unprecedented recession, an inflation near the lower range of the variability interval, and in the verge of undergoing a massive unemployment crisis, it is important to continue easing monetary policy.",
        "He/she pointed out that given the relative and absolute monetary policy stances, there is room for a significant easing of monetary policy and that the low levels of inflation provide a margin for such an adjustment.",
        "He/she added that although uncertainty about its expected path persists, this factor should not be over-dimensioned and should be given less emphasis given the plummeting of economic activity and the loss of millions of jobs, about which there already is certainty.",
        "He/she added that at the global level monetary policy is very lax, which contributes to compensate for the increases in risk premia.",
        "Another member stated that the interest rate must be taken to more accessible levels in a relatively close horizon.",
        "He/she added that the cost and access to credit for micro, small-, and medium-sized firms —which are the ones that generate most of the jobs— are seriously affected during economic crises.",
        "He/she mentioned that if the effect of monetary policy on credit was limited, it would be necessary to resort to more drastic interest rate adjustments.",
        "He/she mentioned that the reductions to the policy rate that have already been implemented and which have decreased the interest rate spread with respect to the US Federal Reserve, have not led to a disorderly increase of the Mexican peso exchange rate, which means that there are other more important factors behind the behavior of said variable.",
        "He/she added that the target rate has been lowered at the same time that inflation expectations have declined.",
        "He/she stated that all of the above seems to indicate that looking ahead there is ample space to continue lowering the policy rate without generating inflationary pressures or jeopardizing the attainment of the inflation target.",
        "One member argued that the monetary policy decision must not only assess the dilemmas associated with the outlook for inflation in an environment characterized by a significant economic contraction, but also consider those associated with the financial shock in terms of both its global and idiosyncratic components.",
        "In particular, he/she mentioned that for a relatively small and open emerging economy, the process for determining the monetary policy stance should consider both the economy’s cyclical position and its influence on inflation, as well as the financial conditions that are being faced and its role in macroeconomic stability, including maintaining low and stable inflation.",
        "In particular, he/she highlighted: i) that it must be ensured that the yield curve adjusts in an orderly manner, without affecting long-term interest rates and maintaining inflationary risk premia at low levels; ii) that some of the effects of the lockdown and of the suspension of economic activities need to be considered, given that in the current environment the reduction of interest rates might have a lower or lagged effect on aggregate demand in the very short term, since the traditional channels of households and firms’ spending are not operating normally, and iii) that although in the steepest phase of the financial and risk aversion-related shock, interest rate spreads were not relevant in the portfolio adjustments that took place, in the following phases they could gain more relevance.",
        "He/she stated that there are elements of stability in domestic financial markets, and for the financial system as a whole, that must be considered in order not to induce or worsen an adjustment of portfolios.",
        "He/she mentioned that this is relevant for Mexico, as it stands out among emerging economies for having financial markets that are highly integrated to international ones and for having a fully convertible currency, where 80% of the volume is traded among non-residents.",
        "Considering all of the above, he/she stated that it is necessary to identify the different challenges and dilemmas that monetary policy faces, assess the scenarios that materialize, and based on these elements define the most convenient adjustments to the monetary policy stance.",
        "Another member considered that in the presence of a global shock and a substantial increase in risk aversion, the signals stemming from certain points of reference that are usually important for monetary policy implementation are now less obvious, which underlines the need for a cautious approach.",
        "In this regard, he/she highlighted less clarity regarding the impact of the interest rate spread with other economies.",
        "He/she argued that, similarly, in addition to the difficulties that are usually involved in estimating the neutral interest rate, it is likely that its use in the assessment of the monetary policy stance is limited in the current juncture.",
        "He/she emphasized that there is a greater than usual degree of uncertainty as to its magnitude and to the direction of the short-term deviations it may be showing versus its long-term level.",
        "The above, due to the lack of clarity regarding the relative importance of opposing effects on the neutral rate stemming from the various factors that are currently affecting the economy, among them the high level of uncertainty and the tightening of external financial conditions, which are probably combined with a lower potential growth.",
        "Most members stated that the outlook for monetary policy continues to be uncertain and complex.",
        "One member considered that the degree of uncertainty regarding the evolution of the main macroeconomic aggregates, of financial markets and the external environment, and thus of inflation, is unusually high.",
        "He/she mentioned that, under these conditions, it is necessary to act with prudence and take advantage of the margins to reduce the interest rate to the extent that the trajectory of inflation allows it.",
        "Another member pointed out that although tensions in domestic financial markets have moderated, several warning indicators persist.",
        "He/she mentioned that the historical capital outflows as well as the increase in sovereign risk and the depreciation of the Mexican peso, are evidence of lower appetite for domestic assets.",
        "Regarding future monetary policy decisions, one member pointed out that it is necessary to send a signal that monetary policy will continue easing depending on how the crisis evolves and of the possible deterioration of the economic and financial conditions.",
        "He/she mentioned that the speed at which the policy rate is lowered depends on: i) maintaining inflation at low levels and within the target; ii) the economic outlook, particularly, the effects of the pandemic; iii) the volatility of financial markets; iv) the risk that a very rapid reduction in interest rates leads to greater capital outflows, and v) idiosyncratic shocks such as a possible fiscal imbalance, a greater deterioration of credit ratings, increases in risk premia or other negative shocks to business confidence and governance.",
        "He/she added that decisive policy rate adjustments are needed in order to situate the monetary policy stance in a lax position and continually assess the possibility of making additional adjustments, even in unscheduled meetings.",
        "He/she added that monitoring the current situation constantly will allow for prompt and effective action.",
        "Another member considered that although he/she agrees that the evolution of the inflation determinants should allow for a further easing of monetary policy in the near future, in his/her opinion providing a more precise guide on the future path of monetary policy is complicated and even unwise in a context of such high uncertainty.",
        "One member was of the opinion that under the current juncture, the most prudent monetary policy would be to significantly lower the policy rate so that the real interest rate lays below its neutral rate as soon as possible, without ruling out the possibility of transitioning to a real interest rate close to cero or even negative.",
        "He/she added that not doing the aforementioned or postponing it for too long would be an unwise decision, as it would affect the domestic economy in a moment of crisis, it would harm financial markets and jeopardize price stability.",
        "Most members mentioned the relevance of implementing of the measures aimed at fostering an orderly behavior of financial markets, strengthening the credit channels, and providing liquidity in order to continue enabling the sound development of the financial system.",
        "Some members added that said measures also aim at preventing disruptions in the payments system.",
        "One member added that they are intended to allow firms and households to have access to the financing they need in the face of a temporary reduction in their income.",
        "He/she mentioned that the announced measures amount to MXN 800 billion, equivalent to measures need to be reinforced in three ways: i) by clearly communicating their scope and that they are being set within the limits imposed by the law; ii) by instrumenting them rapidly and effectively, and iii) by assessing their effects so that, if necessary, their duration and amount are increased in all extension and intensity, or even some additional measures are designed.",
        "He/she emphasized that immediate measures such as regulatory improvements, the easing of rules and regulations and a better governance do not have an impact on the fiscal deficit, but they do have an impact on the incentives for firms’ to resort to the financial system in search for increased credit to maintain their working capital.",
        "He/she pointed out that in addition to the latter, Banco de México, within its capacity and legal powers, must continue collaborating with the public and private sectors for the sake of the economic recovery.",
        "However, the financial sector must also be very proactive so that these resources are channeled easily to firms.",
        "In this regard, Banco de México must coordinate itself closely with the private and public sectors so that the implemented policies are more effective.",
        "He/she indicated that it is of utmost importance to respond to the economic emergency within the powers of the Central Bank and to its maximum capacity to support the population and the economy.",
        "He/she mentioned that this requires acting decisively within the margin that its primary mandate allows it, by communicating the need to adopt a more accommodative policy stance considering the lag with which monetary policy operates.",
        "He/she added that the present crisis requires thinking innovatively and acting boldly.",
        "He/she considered that for this reason it is important to send a message of unity and commitment to solve the crisis.",
        "One member considered that, to allow that the facilities announced by Banco de Mexico foster credit provision in a more effective manner, it is necessary to move towards interest rates that are below their neutral level, in a relatively short horizon.",
        "He/she argued that, otherwise, the coverage of these measures will be rather limited.",
        "Taking into account the referred risks for inflation, economic activity and financial markets, major challenges arise for monetary policy and for the economy in general.",
        "Considering the room for maneuvering that on balance monetary policy has as a result of these implications, and with the presence of all its members, Banco de México’s Governing Board decided unanimously to lower the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 50 basis points to a level of 5.5%.",
        "The Governing Board will take the necessary actions on the basis of incoming information and considering the large impact on productive activity as well as the evolution of the financial shock that we are currently facing, so that the policy rate is consistent with the orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to Banco de México’s target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates.",
        "Perseverance in strengthening the macroeconomic fundamentals and adopting the necessary actions, regarding both monetary and fiscal policies, will contribute to a better adjustment of domestic financial markets and of the economy as a whole.",
        "Alejandro Díaz de León-Carrillo, Irene EspinosaCantellano, Gerardo Esquivel-Hernández, Javier Eduardo Guzmán-Calafell and Jonathan Ernest Heath-Constable voted in favor of lowering the overnight interbank interest rate by 50 basis points to 5.5%."

    "2018": [
        "This section summarizes the views exposed by the members of the Governing Board regarding the monetary policy decision.",
        "All members highlighted that the world economy continued to expand in a generalized manner during the first quarter of 2018.",
        "One member pointed out the increasing international trade and the recovery in investment as the main foundations of world growth.",
        "Most members noted that, at the margin, a slowdown was also observed, and that this is mainly explained by the lower growth of developed economies due to certain temporary factors and to adverse weather conditions.",
        "One member considered that this lower dynamism is also associated with the fact that a significant part of developed and emerging economies is currently undergoing a late stage of their business cycles.",
        "The majority of members mentioned that forecasts for world economic growth for 2018 and 2019 have remained unchanged in relation to the projections published at the beginning of 2018.",
        "One member stated that, despite the increased volatility in financial markets and the concerns about the trade policies that could be adopted, the outlook for world economic recovery rests upon an improvement in labor markets, a higher confidence of economic agents, and the effects of greater fiscal incentives in some developed economies.",
        "Another member mentioned that the expected strengthening of the world economy during the April-June quarter supports the forecast of higher economic growth worldwide in 2018, vis-a-vis 2017.",
        "One member stated that short-term risks to the world economy, that is, for 2018 and 2019, appear to be balanced.",
        "Nevertheless, most members agreed that there are several downward risks, particularly in the medium and long terms, such as the escalation of protectionist trade measures, increased volatility in international financial markets, the tightening of global financial conditions resulting from a fasterthan-expected U.S. monetary policy normalization, and/or the materialization of some geopolitical risks.",
        "In relation to the possible adoption of protectionist measures, most members pointed out that these could have significant effects on international trade and investment.",
        "Particularly, one member noted that, although the fears associated with a U.S.-China trade conflict have tempered in recent weeks, the risk of trade-related tensions between these two countries persists.",
        "This member added that the imposition of restrictions on trade and investment flows would have implications not only for the conflicting parties, but also for the global economy as a whole.",
        "The same member stated that both the allocation of resources and the dynamism of economic activity would be affected at both the regional and global level.",
        "Also, this member argued that major disruptions in global value chains might arise that, by affecting investor confidence, could contribute to increased volatility in international financial markets.",
        "In this context, the same member pointed out that despite the efforts to reduce geopolitical tensions in some regions of the world, these have not faded and have even worsened in some regions, such as the Middle East.",
        "Another member added that, if the current conditions of rapidly ageing population and low productivity growth in some countries persist, the average potential growth of the world economy could fall to levels of between 2.3% and 2.5% in annual terms in the next decade.",
        "In relation to world inflation, some members stated that, during the first quarter of 2018, there were gradual increases in inflation in certain economies, derived partly from the increasing prices of commodities and a significant reduction of slack in labor markets.",
        "One member pointed out that these price increases have been fueled by the outlook for continued global economic growth and, in the case of energy goods, that oil prices have also been affected by some supply-related factors.",
        "Another member emphasized that the re-imposition of sanctions on Iran recently announced by the United States, has contributed to the spike in international oil prices to levels unseen since the end of 2014, and that this could have relevant implications for economic activity and inflation in several developed and emerging economies.",
        "In this regard, another member pointed out that the outlook for world inflation is that it will continue on an upward trend, albeit increasing at a more moderate pace, and that the prices of assets currently incorporate this prevision.",
        "Another member added that, although the balance of short-term risks to world inflation remains stable, latent upward risk factors persist for the months ahead.",
        "Most members emphasized that economic activity in the U.S. grew at a more moderate pace during the first quarter of 2018.",
        "Some members pointed out that this was mainly due to the lower expansion of private consumption.",
        "One member added that this slowdown was partially offset by higher levels of investment.",
        "The same member mentioned that this lower growth took place in an environment where economic agents’ confidence is at historically high levels.",
        "One member noted that the U.S. economy has undergone an atypical cycle of extended and gradual recovery.",
        "In this regard, some members emphasized that data indicate a continued strengthening of the labor market, while the unemployment rate is at its lowest levels of the last decades.",
        "Thus, most members pointed out that there has been a sustained reduction in the degree of slack in the U.S. economy.",
        "As for forecasts for U.S. economic activity, most members underlined that it is expected to grow at a solid pace in the coming quarters.",
        "They also mentioned that timely indicators of private demand suggest an uptick in growth during the second quarter and a greater dynamism for the remainder of 2018 and in 2019.",
        "One member added that the significant tax cuts approved at the end of last year and the expected increase in the government’s budget will have the most significant effects on growth precisely in these two years.",
        "Another member added that growth forecasts for these years already incorporate the effects of the tax reform and that they remain stable at 2.8% and some members mentioned the possibility of the effects of the tax incentives gradually fading in the following years.",
        "One member stated that the higher interest rates along the yield curve could also have a negative impact on growth.",
        "Another member mentioned that another risk to economic activity is the possibility of a further deterioration in U.S. public finances, as well as the materialization of scenarios associated with both tariff-related issues with China and geopolitical conflicts.",
        "Regarding U.S. inflation, one member stated that there appears to be a consensus that the Phillips curve has flattened sharply in the last years, which could explain why the tightening in U.S. labor market conditions has not led to stronger pressures on wages and inflation.",
        "Also, this member added that two important factors to explain this situation would be the increased automation of various manufacturing processes and the effect of globalization.",
        "Another member pointed out that the U.S. Federal Reserve acknowledged in its last monetary policy statement that both headline and core inflation have come closer to their 2% target.",
        "Furthermore, most members emphasized that the Fed stated that it expects inflation to be around its such emphasis on symmetry could be interpreted as a certain tolerance to inflation figures above the target.",
        "Some members suggested that inflation could be subject to upward pressures in an environment where the labor market is near full employment and facing the possibility of the U.S. economy operating above potential in the coming years.",
        "One member pointed out that the above has led to an upward revision in inflation expectations, as well as an increase in inflationary uncertainty and a possible upward bias in inflation.",
        "Another member indicated that, notwithstanding the above, financial markets do not appear to assign a high likelihood to the possibility of adverse inflationary shock in the U.S.",
        "Most members highlighted that in its FOMC meeting of May, the U.S. Federal Reserve kept unchanged the target range for the federal funds rate at a level of 1.5% to 1.75%, as was expected.",
        "They pointed out that the Fed also reiterated its expectation of gradual increases in its target range.",
        "They also noted that, given the degree of slack in the U.S. economy, and in an environment of fiscal stimulus measures, the materialization of a scenario of a faster monetary policy adjustment is increasingly probable for both markets and analysts, which have changed their projections from to 3 to 4 policy adjustments in 2018.",
        "In this regard, one member said that expectations that U.S. inflation will converge to its target sooner than other advanced economies, has resulted in expectations of U.S. interest rates increasing at a higher and faster rate than in other advanced economies.",
        "In relation to the rest of the developed economies, one member stated that during the first quarter of terms, due to a reduction in the dynamism of demand, after the strong recovery observed in 2017.",
        "Another member pointed out that, in addition to other factors, the above could have been reflected in the recent weakness of their currencies against the US dollar.",
        "Some members emphasized that growth expectations for the Eurozone economies continue to indicate a greater dynamism in 2018 and 2019.",
        "In this regard, one member added that the Eurozone is expected to grow 2.3% in 2018 and 2.0% in 2019.",
        "Another member stated that although growth estimates at the beginning of 2018 for Japan and the Eurozone for 2018 and 2019 were revised upwards, the latest information is not clear as to how strong their economic expansion will be.",
        "Some members underlined that labor markets in developed economies show tight cyclical conditions.",
        "One member added that there has been a moderate increase in wages, inflation, and inflation expectations.",
        "Another member stated that slack conditions in the Eurozone have not been exhausted, in contrast with those of the U.S. economy.",
        "The same member pointed out that in the rest of the advanced economies, inflation is still below their central banks’ targets and, as a result, these countries have maintained an accommodative monetary policy stance, which is likely to continue at least for the rest of 2018.",
        "The same member also emphasized that up to March 2018, inflation in the Eurozone had not yet attained its target level, while the unemployment rate continued falling.",
        "Also, that member argued that this was the reason why, in its last monetary policy decision of April, the European Central Bank (ECB) left its reference rate unchanged and indicated that it will end its asset purchase program in September 2018 and will begin the gradual normalization of the reference rate until the second half of 2019.",
        "The same member mentioned that the Bank of England kept its reference rate at March, its lowest level in one year.",
        "This member also stated that Brexit negotiations pose an additional challenge for the U.K. Monetary Policy Committee to enable a faster monetary policy normalization process in 2018.",
        "This member also added that the Bank of Japan will continue with its accommodative monetary policy stance in the coming months and has changed the period of time to attain its 2% inflation target for fiscal year 2019.",
        "Some members agreed that emerging economies grew at a high rate during the first quarter of 2018.",
        "One member pointed out that China grew at an annual rate of 6.8%, fueled mainly by consumption.",
        "Another member indicated that labor markets in several emerging economies also show tight cyclical conditions.",
        "One member added that in these economies inflation remains close, or even below, their central banks’ targets, except for Turkey and Argentina.",
        "The same member highlighted the case of Colombia, where the central bank continues its monetary easing cycle, as reflected by the recent cut of 25 basis points in its reference rate.",
        "The same member underlined that, despite the good performance of emerging economies, risks persist, particularly for China, due to its deleveraging process and to growing trade tensions with the US.",
        "All members pointed out that there has been an increase in interest rates in the U.S., particularly for shorter terms, while the US dollar has strengthened in a generalized manner.",
        "One member mentioned that these results are due to the relatively better performance of the U.S. economy, vis-a-vis other advanced economies, as well as to the convergence of inflation to the Federal Reserve’s target and to expectations that the Fed will continue its monetary policy normalization process in the short term.",
        "Another member added the upward revision in inflation expectations, the greater inflationary uncertainty, and even a possible upward bias in inflation as other factors leading to increases in U.S. interest rates.",
        "The same member explained that, since the beginning of September 2017 to date, 2year bond interest rates have increased by more than 120 basis points, while 10-year bond interest rates did so by more than 100 basis points and exceeded 3.0%.",
        "One member pointed out that these rates reached their highest levels since 2008 in 2year maturities and since 2014 in longer maturities.",
        "The majority of members agreed that the increase in U.S. government securities’ interest rates has generated episodes of volatility in international financial markets, lower risk appetite, and capital outflows from emerging economies.",
        "One member expressed that this market adjustment occurred in a relatively orderly manner, but another noted that capital outflows from emerging economies could intensify in the months and years ahead.",
        "Some members noted that gains in asset price valuations have reverted.",
        "Particularly, one of the members mentioned that the search for yield in higher-risk instruments has also reverted due to adjustments in both the inflation outlook and interest rates.",
        "The same member pointed out that such reversal took place in an environment where, throughout 2017 and early 2018, stock markets had grown significantly and the search for yield prevailed in response to the expected tax cuts and to the prevision that interest rates would increase at a sufficiently gradual pace.",
        "Some members noted that, in an environment of a lesser search for yield, the idiosyncratic factors of the different emerging economies could become more relevant to determine their market prices.",
        "Particularly, one of the members mentioned that the tightening of financial conditions that is likely to ensue in the years ahead would affect mostly those economies that still have weak fundamentals, such as high levels of indebtedness, especially when denominated in foreign currency.",
        "One member highlighted that, in the absence of historical precedents, a faster-than-expected increase in the level of U.S. wages, inflation and reference interest rates, could result in strong financial stress worldwide due to the re-composition of foreign investors’ portfolios in unforeseen magnitudes.",
        "The same member emphasized that this would affect capital flows to emerging economies like Mexico.",
        "Most members pointed out that the available information suggests that Mexico’s economic activity continued to rebound in the first quarter of 2018, attaining an even higher growth rate than in the previous quarter.",
        "One member stated that this compares favorably with the slowdown of the first three quarters of 2017, while another noted that this was the highest quarterly GDP growth rate figure since July-September 2016.",
        "Most members added that exports continued to follow a positive trajectory, while private consumption continued to expand, albeit at a slower pace, and that investment recovered.",
        "Most members pointed out that the recovery in investment was driven by the reconstruction efforts after the earthquakes of September 2017 and by certain public infrastructure projects, some of them adding that the recent recovery of spending in domestic and imported machinery and equipment have also contributed to the upswing in investment.",
        "Most members noted that, as to productive activity, economic growth in the first quarter of 2018 reflected both the dynamism of services and the recovery of industrial activity, which is explained mainly by the abovementioned upturn in construction and manufacturing.",
        "In terms of a lower frequency view, some members pointed out that, in the last years, the country’s economy has been subject to marked uncertainty and decreased availability of external resources, which has led to a sharp depreciation of the real exchange rate.",
        "Some members expressed their views that aggregate demand has been adjusting to the changing relative prices and to an environment of higher real interest rates in the U.S. One of the members added that, in general terms, this has resulted in a greater dynamism of exports, a certain moderation in consumption, and in weak investment, although the latest information shows that it has slightly recovered.",
        "Some members mentioned that the forecasts for growth in Mexico for 2018 and 2019 remain stable.",
        "Some members noted that the higher growth rates observed during the first quarter of 2018 are not expected to continue in the following months.",
        "In this regard, one of them considered that the latter is because the uptick in certain GDP components is apparently a response to temporary factors, and to the fact that both investment and industrial production figures partly reflect the effect of the reconstruction efforts to address the impact of the earthquakes that hit the country in September 2017.",
        "This member noted that what has been observed frequently in previous election processes, is stronger economic activity in the first half of the year, which reverts, at least partially, in the second half.",
        "Thus, this member held, that although, in principle, the higher-than-expected growth of GDP during January-March would imply an upward revision of what extent the trajectory of economic activity in the months ahead is affected by the aforementioned factors.",
        "Most members pointed out that, although the latest economic activity figures indicate a greater dynamism, given the prevailing conditions of economic uncertainty the balance of risks to growth continues to be downward-biased.",
        "One member noted that several risk factors, external and domestic, influence the above.",
        "Most members mentioned that downward risks include the uncertainty related to the renegotiation of the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the volatility associated with the electoral process, one of them adding the risk of post-electoral volatility.",
        "As for the first risk, one member noted the possible negative impact of uncertainty on aggregate demand.",
        "Another member pointed out that reaching an agreement in NAFTA renegotiations in the next days or before the country’s elections, as had been announced, seems very unlikely, and therefore the renegotiation rounds could be postponed until next year, which could imply cautious decisions related to spending and/or that investment projects will be postponed further.",
        "As for the second risk, the same member highlighted that it is difficult to anticipate the magnitude and duration of these volatility episodes, but that a strongly influential factor could be a small percentage difference between the election’s winner and the runner-up.",
        "Some members mentioned other additional risks to growth, such as the tightening of international monetary and financial conditions, a faster-than-expected normalization of U.S. monetary policy, and/or unexpected changes in the aforementioned normalization process.",
        "Some members noted that, in light of this risk, volatility in international financial markets could increase, affecting economic activity growth and capital flows to emerging economies, including Mexico.",
        "One member also mentioned the risk implicit in the tax reform approval by U.S. Congress last December, explaining that it could affect private sector investment decisions, which in turn would impact Mexico’s tax base and economic activity.",
        "Some members also mentioned the adoption of protectionist trade policies as a risk, while one member also included the potential impact of the materialization of geopolitical risks.",
        "One member pointed out the need for Banco de México to refine its analysis of the balance of risks to inflation and growth, mentioning that the probability of several of these risks taking place changes significantly over time, a fact that has never been mentioned before, and that the nature of risks in terms of how they affect growth and inflation in the short, medium and long terms should be distinguished.",
        "This member considered that the risks to growth in the short term have diminished considerably, while those for the medium and long terms have not.",
        "As for the economy’s cyclical position, most members emphasized that conditions remained tight, particularly in the labor market.",
        "In this regard, one member noted that statistical estimates suggest that the unemployment rate is significantly below its long-term level.",
        "Nevertheless, this member argued that there is the possibility that the latter does not reflect accurately labor market conditions, particularly because wages are not showing an excessive increase and the demand-side pressures that would be expected under those circumstances are not observed.",
        "The same member mentioned that the labor market situation is more compatible with the close-to-zero output gap estimates and that the recent trajectory of three of the four indicators used by Banco de México to estimate monthly slack indices, also point to that conclusion.",
        "Another member stated that indicators of the cyclical position of the economy show, at the margin, that tightness has been decreasing at a moderate pace.",
        "The same member noted that indicators of labor market slack should be interpreted cautiously because, in general terms, they react to the cyclical conditions with a lag.",
        "That member mentioned also that loose cyclical conditions had not been observed since some months ago and that in the past Banco de México’s communications regarding this matter had not been very clear and opportune.",
        "This member also considered that it would be consistent to observe pressures on nominal wages generated by the economy’s cyclical conditions, simultaneously with a fall in real wages, given the depreciation of the real exchange rate, which would result in a slower adjustment of inflation to its target, if monetary policy were not operating effectively.",
        "This member pointed out that, if the cyclical conditions had been less tight, inflation would have fallen very rapidly under the monetary policy stance adopted by the central bank.",
        "Likewise, that a broad range of labor market indicators suggest that there is no slack in this market.",
        "For this member, the economy’s tighter cyclical conditions over the last years have been a determining factor in the adjustments to the monetary policy target rate.",
        "The same member emphasized that Banco de México recently acted in a timely manner when it published its new indicators to better understand the economic cycle, emphasizing the need to take full advantage of the publication of these indicators to improve the central bank’s communication on economic slack matters, as has been done.",
        "In this regard, another member noted that it is necessary to evaluate accurately the market conditions in order to fully identify their role in the price formation process.",
        "All members pointed out that during the first four months of 2018, annual headline inflation continued to decrease.",
        "Most members stated that the fall in observed inflation is consistent with the forecasts published by Banco de México in its OctoberDecember 2017 Quarterly Report.",
        "Some members considered that this indicator has fallen more sharply than expected, from 6.77% in December to 4.55% in April.",
        "One mentioned that, although the behavior of headline inflation has been the result of temporary reductions in the prices of some products, the percentage of items in the CPI basket with annualized monthly increases below or equal to 3% has continued to increase and in April accounted for too early to be confident that the process of inflation reduction in 2018 has been consolidated.",
        "As for core inflation, some members pointed out that from December to April it decreased from 4.87% to agreed that this reduction has been the result of the monetary policy actions adopted and of the fading out of the shocks that affected it last year.",
        "One member stated that core inflation has reached levels below the upper bound of the variability interval around the central bank’s inflation target, adding that the fundamental core inflation indicator, a variable that reflects more adequately changes in the economic cycle, has continued to fall, registering figures below those of core inflation.",
        "As for non-core inflation, some members mentioned that from December to April, it decreased from 12.62% to this result is mainly due to reductions in the prices of certain fruits and vegetables and of LP gas.",
        "Finally, in this respect, one member said that this component remains at high levels and that it has been under certain additional pressures, especially related to gasoline prices.",
        "All members agreed that headline inflation expectations for the end of 2018 were revised slightly downwards, while those for the medium and long terms remained stable.",
        "Some stated that inflation expectations for the end of 2018 were revised downwards from 4.09% in March to 3.98% in April.",
        "One member mentioned that the anchoring of medium and long run inflation expectations makes it clear that Banco de México’s monetary policy actions have prevented the emergence of second-round effects from the different shocks that have affected prices.",
        "Nevertheless, this member also pointed out that inflation expectations for all terms are above the central bank’s projections.",
        "In this regard, most members said that long-term inflation expectations remain above the target, around 3.5%.",
        "One member mentioned that long-term inflation expectations in recent years have fluctuated no more than 20 basis points around 3.5%, even when inflation figures were below the target –like in 2015- or above the target like in 2017.",
        "This member stated that this outcome could respond to various motives, and that Banco de México has tried to strengthen its commitment to attain the inflation target by adopting measures to increase the central bank’s transparency and accountability.",
        "As for inflation expectations derived from market instruments, one member mentioned that these have remained unchanged for three consecutive months, while another stated that the differentials between nominal and real yields continue suggesting upward risks for inflation in the long run.",
        "Most members agreed that looking forward, and in view of the current monetary policy stance, inflation will continue to be in line with the forecasts published in Banco de México’s October-December 2017 Quarterly Report.",
        "One member stated that forecasts for the end of 2018 for both headline and core inflation were adjusted slightly to the downside, while those for non-core inflation rose because the outlook for prices of energy goods was adjusted.",
        "Another member mentioned that the forecasts for terms over one year continue in line with the convergence of inflation to its target.",
        "Most members acknowledged that the base scenario assumes an orderly behavior of the exchange rate, the absence of labor market pressures, and non-core inflation continuing to decline at the expected rate for the remainder of factors that might affect inflation and delay the forecasted disinflationary trajectory, and the convergence of inflation to its target.",
        "Another member considered such convergence will occur in the first half of 2019.",
        "Most members coincided that the balance of risks to inflation in relation to its expected path is still biased upwards, in an environment characterized by a high degree of uncertainty.",
        "Some members pointed out that such bias responds to the possibility that the assumptions incorporated in the aforementioned inflation forecasts are affected by several factors.",
        "One member mentioned that this balance has not deteriorated in relation to that mentioned in the previous monetary policy statement, while another member said that there are still risks and uncertainty in the short term, which appear to have increased, in relation to the scenario foreseen in the last monetary policy decision meeting.",
        "Among the main upward risks, most members agreed that the peso exchange rate could continue to be under pressure due to both an environment of higher external interest rates and the strengthening of the US dollar, and uncertainty associated with NAFTA negotiations and Mexico’s the uncertainty related to the post-election period.",
        "As for NAFTA renegotiations, some members stated that there is the risk of negotiations extending for a long period, while one added that there is an additional risk of these renegotiations having a negative outcome.",
        "This member also included other risks, such as the geopolitical ones, albeit specifying that markets do not perceive them to have a high probability of materializing, despite their media coverage.",
        "In addition, this member mentioned the risk of having an adverse inflationary shock in the U.S. and the significant risk the U.S. tax reform could pose on investment and public finances in Mexico.",
        "The same member also pointed out the structural weakness of Mexican public finances as an additional risk to inflation and that total factor productivity in Mexico has remained stagnant for many years.",
        "This member highlighted that, if this latter development continues, or if productivity even falls, adverse shocks –both external and domesticcould have greater effects on the price level and, therefore, on inflation, and at a faster pace.",
        "This member added that this is a risk in the short and medium terms that could last very long if the different factors that affect productivity are not addressed.",
        "Moreover, he argued that the apparent weak association between aggregate economic activity and employment in Mexico is a clear reflection of the abovementioned problem.",
        "The same member stated that, indeed, in the last years, employment has grown at rates above productive activity, thus suggesting that the jobs that are currently being created show, on average, low productivity levels.",
        "On another front, he also added the presence of another risk generated by the fact that inflation expectations are currently anchored at 3.5%, above Banco de México’s target, and that the continuous presence of different risks and the fact that they could occur simultaneously, could considerably affect the rate of price growth.",
        "This member argued that the balance of risks described above includes only those high-frequency risks related to the business cycle, albeit noting that there are also others of low frequency and structural nature.",
        "To conclude, this member noted that it is important: i) to specify which risks are temporary and which could possibly lead to permanent shocks; ii) to identify their nominal or real nature, and if they are domestic or external, and iii) to identify how these shocks have evolved.",
        "One member stated that sudden increases in non-core inflation cannot be ruled out, given the volatility exhibited by most of its components.",
        "Another member mentioned, among these risks, the possibility of shocks to the prices of agricultural products and upward pressure on the prices of some energy-related goods.",
        "This member also added that there could be a risk in 2019 –generated by the new administration- of possible changes in the policy for government-authorized prices.",
        "Most members specified that given the economy’s cyclical conditions, unit labor costs could put a pressure on inflation.",
        "In this regard, one member added the possibility of demand-side pressures.",
        "As for downward risks, some members pointed out a possible appreciation of the Mexican peso if NAFTA negotiations have a favorable outcome.",
        "As for Mexican financial markets, most members pointed out that since the last monetary policy decision, the peso depreciated significantly and became increasingly volatile, in line with the exchange rates of most emerging economies.",
        "They ascertained that the evolution of the peso was due to the generalized strengthening of the US dollar as well as to domestic factors, such as the uncertainty about the NAFTA renegotiation and the country’s elections.",
        "One member noted that these two factors caused the Mexican peso to be among emerging economies’ most depreciated currencies in the period, and explained that, of these two factors, the outcome of the NAFTA renegotiations was the one that had the most adverse impact on the peso’s exchange rate.",
        "Another member underlined that the increase in implied volatility in exchange rate options has been particularly noticeable for those maturing after the elections; and that this behavior is related to both the diminished expectations of reaching a favorable agreement within the NAFTA rounds in the next weeks and the uncertainty associated with the country’s elections, which gains relevance as the day of the election approaches.",
        "Some members pointed out that, under this environment, foreign exchange market conditions slightly deteriorated; of these members, one specified that higher bid/ask spreads and a decreased market depth was observed.",
        "Another member stated that the market has operated under orderly conditions.",
        "As for interest rates in Mexico, one member mentioned that these posted increases throughout the yield curve, affected by the same factors that had an impact on the peso exchange rate.",
        "This member noted that such increases were of higher magnitude than in the U.S. Another member noted that a restructuring in foreign investors’ government securities portfolio has been observed, towards more medium- and long-term positions, while opting for less positions in options with maturities under three years.",
        "As for the development of domestic financial markets in the near future, one member pointed out that such markets and the peso’s exchange rate could be affected by the aforementioned risks.",
        "In view of these conditions, another member mentioned that foreign exchange rate expectations, drawn from Banco de México’s Survey of Private Sector Forecasters, remain relatively unchanged since the last monetary policy decision, posting, on average, and 2019, respectively.",
        "This member also mentioned that this could suggest that, although the market recognizes some degree of volatility surrounding the country’s elections, it assumes that in the medium-and long terms the peso’s foreign exchange will return to the levels observed at the beginning of 2018, thus implying that the prevailing macroeconomic conditions are expected to continue.",
        "One member gave insight as to the external and domestic risks that financial markets face.",
        "Regarding external risks, this member mentioned that markets do not seem to consider that there is a high probability of an adverse inflationary shock in the U.S. or that the abovementioned geopolitical risks will materialize.",
        "As for domestic risks, markets are incorporating a high probability of NAFTA renegotiations extending or having an adverse outcome, while they do not seem to fully incorporate the risk of a higher volatility associated with the election process.",
        "This member pointed out that although government economic authorities pursue different objectives than financial market participants and that, therefore, they evaluate both risks and their implications differently, for the monetary authority’s decision making it is important to analyze how the markets are assessing the different types of risk and how that assessment is being reflected in the behavior of asset prices.",
        "Some members pointed out that it is worth highlighting that the Mexican economy has been subject to marked levels of uncertainty and a lower availability of external resources, which have led to a significant depreciation of the real exchange rate and to an increase in real interest rates.",
        "One of the members added that in response to the financing shock that affected the economy in recent years, the monetary policy response adopted by the central bank contributed to a major correction aimed at reducing the current account deficit.",
        "Another member stated that the monetary policy stance adopted to keep medium- and long-term inflation expectations anchored, together with the attainment of the fiscal objectives and the financial system’s resilience, have contributed to place the Mexican economy in a better position to face possible adverse scenarios.",
        "One of the members noted that, looking ahead, the economy is expected to continue undergoing a complex environment, both in the external and domestic fronts.",
        "This member added that, for this reason, it is important that, in addition to following a prudent and robust monetary policy, authorities adopt measures to foster a greater productivity and achieve a sustainable consolidation of public finances.",
        "The same member also underlined the importance of consolidating the economy’s resilience and furthering the progress of the Mexican financial system, emphasizing that it is an essential ingredient, in order to reduce the probability of possible abrupt restructurings of investment portfolios and even of capital outflows.",
        "Another member highlighted that it is essential to consider the possibility of transiting through a period of high uncertainty for a long time, and that even in a scenario in which some of the current challenges could fade, others will probably persist for a prolonged period, such as the tightening of external financial conditions.",
        "The same member underlined that, in this environment, the required scope of action encompasses other areas beside monetary policy, and that the magnitude of the challenges that the country is facing brings to the fore the need for timely and adequate economic policy responses, in order to strengthen the economy’s fundamentals.",
        "The same member mentioned that, although some sources of uncertainty are beyond the control of the authorities, there are others that are not and, for this reason, once the election process concludes, it will be important to know as soon as possible the detailed economic policy actions that the incoming administration has the intention of implementing, particularly regarding the management of public finances.",
        "One of the members stated that regardless of who the winner of the election is, the perception that public finances and the fiscal stance may suffer, in general terms, a deterioration, has started to gain relevance, given that the winner of the elections will have to fulfill several of the actions and public policies promised during the campaign.",
        "The same member added that, as is well known, the Public Sector Borrowing Requirements’ Historical Balance exhibited, in gross terms, a sizable increase through the last years, except for 2017, reaching levels above 50% of GDP.",
        "The same member considered that this is a very important risk given the structural weakness of public finances, and that the adverse effects would be greater if Mexico’s sovereign risk ratings deteriorate in case of this eventuality.",
        "The same member added that this could also be considered as a short- medium- and long-term risk.",
        "Some members mentioned as an additional risk for Mexican public finances, the effects that the US tax reform approved last year might have.",
        "Among the elements of uncertainty that the Mexican economy will continue to face, one of the members underlined the adverse sociopolitical environment that prevails in the country.",
        "The same member mentioned that the election process that will take place in July, besides generating extreme polarization, poses an unprecedented institutional challenge for the electoral and jurisdictional authorities that will have to judge the elections, given the number and complexity of the aspects it involves.",
        "This member also mentioned that this situation, already complex weakness where the State itself is vulnerable to various crime groups, particularly in certain regions of the country.",
        "This member cited as examples of this situation the growing number of cargo trains that are attacked every day, the increasing clandestine fuel supply lines, as well as the figures published by the National Electoral Institute (Instituto Nacional Electoral, INE) regarding the resignation of candidates running for election office to safeguard their lives and, in more dramatic although less frequent cases, the homicides of candidates during the electoral campaign.",
        "Also, that same member stated that in addition to the temporary uncertainty that is always associated with all election processes, which in itself involves an unfavorable environment for economic activity, there is another type of uncertainty that is not related to the election’s results, but that runs deeper, is not limited in time, and that bears relation with the minimum regulatory effectiveness that is essential for economic and any other kind of development.",
        "The same member added that it is precisely this very effectiveness that is directly undermined by corruption, since the goal of the latter is to make regulation ineffective.",
        "In this context, another member highlighted that a determining factor of the lack of growth in the country’s total factor productivity is the absence of the rule of law.",
        "The same member underlined that, to improve this situation, corruption and impunity should be fought since, in many cases, they represent the greatest threat in making property rights sustain a dynamic investment process.",
        "For this reason, this member emphasized that, although there are several channels that should be addressed to increase the level of investment and productivity in the economy, it is essential to respect and have a clear understanding of property rights.",
        "All members of the Governing Board agreed that the downward trajectory followed by inflation can be, to a large extent, attributed to the monetary policy actions adopted by Banco de México.",
        "One member pointed out that these actions have allowed the economy to avoid second-round effects, originated by the shocks on certain prices, from taking place.",
        "Another member emphasized that, in Mexico, adopting a tighter and robust monetary policy has contributed to an orderly adjustment in the yield curve, the foreign exchange market and the other financial markets in Mexico.",
        "All members pointed out that the current monetary policy stance is consistent with annual headline inflation following a downward trend to its target.",
        "All members also mentioned that monetary policy has been implemented under an adverse and uncertain environment, and that several domestic and external factors still persist.",
        "For this reason, all members agreed that it is necessary to continue implementing a prudent monetary policy.",
        "All members also indicated that the Mexican economy could be affected by some shocks that could generate additional inflationary pressures in the following months.",
        "These shocks, all members pointed out, must be assessed and monitored.",
        "One member pointed out that the effects these shocks might have on the expected disinflation trajectory, within the horizon in which monetary policy operates, need to be considered.",
        "Some members mentioned the possibility of these shocks materializing simultaneously, and one of these members emphasizing that the covariance among different shocks could be possibly positive.",
        "One member noted that since some months ago, monetary policy has been implemented under conditions of higherthan-normal uncertainty, and that the latter has not faded as the key dates for certain risk factors have come nearer.",
        "The same member pointed out that some risks have even started to materialize.",
        "This member also pointed out that the events of recent weeks are an example of some of the challenges monetary policy could face in the following months.",
        "The same member also stated that some risks may worsen as other key dates approach, and that the implications for monetary policy under such a complex environment are clear: monetary policy must focus on attaining the convergence of inflation to its target, facing decisively any shock that might arise, and preserving the central bank’s credibility through an approach emphasizing prudence, without disregarding its implications for economic activity.",
        "The same member stated that this could imply new upward adjustments to the reference interest rate, even in the near future.",
        "One member pointed out that given the highly uncertain environment, it is important that the monetary policy stance continues to contribute to an orderly adjustment of the Mexican financial markets, including the foreign exchange market.",
        "The same member pointed out that in the case the Mexican economy should face and adverse scenario that would require the real exchange rate to be adjusted, measures would need to be taken to prevent medium- and long-term inflation expectations from being affected and second-round effects on the price formation process from taking place.",
        "Finally, all members emphasized that it is important that monetary policy continues to contribute to the convergence of inflation to its target and to strengthen the anchoring of inflation expectations.",
        "To guide its monetary policy actions, Banco de México’s Governing Board closely follows the development of inflation vis-a-vis its anticipated trajectory, taking into account the monetary policy stance adopted and the horizon in which monetary policy operates, as well as available information on all inflation determinants and on medium- and longterm inflation expectations, including the balance of risks to such factors.",
        "Considering the latest information on these elements and that the current monetary policy stance is consistent with annual headline inflation following a downward trend to its target, Banco de México’s Governing Board voted unanimously to keep the target for the overnight interbank interest rate unchanged at 7.50%.",
        "Looking ahead, the Governing Board will maintain a prudent monetary policy stance and continue following closely the potential pass-through of exchange rate fluctuations on prices, the monetary policy stance relative to that of the U.S., and the conditions of slack in the Mexican economy.",
        "In the presence of factors that, by their nature, may involve risks to both inflation and inflation expectations, monetary policy will be conducted in a timely and robust manner to attain the convergence of inflation to its 3% target and to firmly anchor medium- and long-term inflation expectations.",
        "Members voting in favor of this decision: Alejandro Díaz de León-Carrillo, Roberto Del CuetoLegaspi, Irene Espinosa-Cantellano, Javier Eduardo Guzmán-Calafell, and Manuel Ramos-Francia voted unanimously to keep the target rate unchanged at",
        "This section summarizes the views expressed by the members of the Governing Board regarding the monetary policy decision.",
        "All members highlighted that available data for the second quarter of 2018 suggest that the world economy continued to grow at a relatively fast pace.",
        "One member noted that it grew above potential during the first half of the year.",
        "Nevertheless, all members pointed out that there is an increasing divergence in growth among countries and regions.",
        "Most members stated that prospects for a solid growth rate of the world economy are maintained for also prevails for 2019.",
        "However, all members agreed that the world economy’s performance is subject to uncertainty and that risks to the downside for world economic growth have increased even in the short term and, to a larger extent, in the medium term.",
        "All members considered the following as the most relevant risks to the world economy: i) an escalation of trade disputes; ii) a possible tightening of financial conditions; and, iii) the materialization of geopolitical risks.",
        "Regarding the first of these risks, some members mentioned that, recently, the threat of protectionism has increased in some countries.",
        "The same members highlighted that the U.S. has adopted some of these measures, announcing the possibility of even imposing additional tariffs.",
        "This has led to retaliatory measures by the affected countries.",
        "Particularly, one of the members warned about the possibility of the U.S. imposing additional tariffs on Chinese exports as well as trade barriers on automotive imports.",
        "All members emphasized that international trade flows are already showing the effects from these protectionist measures.",
        "In this regard, one member pointed out that a downward trend can already be observed in the emerging countries’ trade volume, particularly in Asia and Latin America, as well as in the Purchasing Managers’ Indexes (PMIs) of these regions.",
        "Another member stated that in the Eurozone and Asia there has been a decline in export manufacturing orders.",
        "The same member noted that some recent studies indicate that protectionist measures of this sort could significantly affect international investment and capital flows, particularly if they have a negative effect on confidence levels.",
        "In this context, some members stated that the possibility of escalating trade tensions is far from fading, despite the fact that, in recent days, U.S. and European Union representatives agreed to keep the tariff system that rules their bilateral trade unchanged, and even expressed the view of engaging in further liberalization.",
        "As for the second risk, most members made reference to a possible tightening of global financial conditions due to a faster-than-expected normalization of U.S. monetary policy in a context of elevated debt levels worldwide, which even exceed those observed prior to the global financial crisis.",
        "In this environment, one member noted that this risk has increased, given the U.S. economy’s position in the current business cycle and the adoption of an expansionary fiscal policy.",
        "As for the third risk, one member pointed out that geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and other regions persist, and that there are no signs of them mitigating.",
        "Another member explained that, although the tensions associated with North Korea have apparently diminished, those related to Iran and to the effects of the U.S. economic blockade to this country, have increased.",
        "The same member added that despite the low probability of this type of risks, they could have significant implications for the prices of some commodities and for global risk appetite.",
        "In addition to the above mentioned risks, some members included other factors that could affect the world economy’s performance negatively.",
        "One member pointed out that the probability of a slowdown in U.S. growth is another risk to world economic growth.",
        "Some members noted that an economic slowdown in the U.S. may ensue given that the current business cycle is in an advanced stage.",
        "One member even mentioned the possibility of an economic recession in this country in the next years, and highlighted that such recession would be worsened by the deteriorated conditions of its public finances.",
        "Another member pointed out that the development of oil prices could have a negative impact on the growth rate of world economic activity.",
        "The same member added that, although the recovery of oil prices from their lowest levels in 2016 has partly been reverted in recent months, they may reach levels above those expected by markets if there are disruptions in the supply for oil.",
        "Finally, some members pointed out that the uncertainty related to elections in both advanced and emerging countries as well as to the terms and conditions of Brexit, may also have a negative effect on confidence levels and, in turn, on global investment and growth.",
        "Regarding world inflation, some members mentioned that in advanced economies inflation continues to converge gradually to central banks’ targets.",

        "In this regard, the same member expressed that, towards the end of 2018, world inflation is expected to near regions than in others.",
        "The same member highlighted that the balance of risks to inflation in the short term is starting to deteriorate.",
        "The same member also pointed out that several risks to inflation in the medium term are expected to continue, underlining among these the persistence of an upward trend in fuel prices and the problems that certain emerging economies may have due to external or fiscal imbalances.",
        "In regards to the performance of advanced economies, some members stated that several of them may have even reached the peak of their business cycle.",
        "Most members noted that U.S. economic activity grew at faster rate during the second quarter, partly in response to the fiscal stimulus adopted.",
        "Another member pointed out that this performance reflected the growth of most aggregate demand components.",
        "Another member mentioned that the increasing domestic demand is also due to the low levels of unemployment.",
        "In this regard, some members added that the latter have reached several-decade minimum levels in this country.",
        "In this regard, another member added that U.S labor market conditions remain tight and highlighted that wages and earnings, as well as the labor cost index, are on an upward trend.",
        "Some members stated that this environment of reduced slack may exert greater pressures on inflation.",
        "In line with the above, some members noted that the labor market conditions have been reflected in an upward trend of inflation and its expectations, mostly those for short- and medium-terms.",
        "As for growth forecasts, some members pointed out that timely indicators suggest that, in the U.S., GDP will continue growing at a high rate for the remainder of the year.",
        "One of the members stated that given both the current U.S. business cycle and the timing of the fiscal stimulus, the U.S. economy is expected to continue growing at a robust rate, not only for the remainder of 2018, but also during 2019.",
        "In this context, one member noted that, indeed, U.S. growth forecasts have been revised upwards, although, as some members mentioned above, there is the possibility of a deceleration in subsequent years.",
        "As for other advanced economies, most members highlighted that, in contrast with the U.S. economic dynamism, most recent data on economic activity in the Eurozone, United Kingdom and Japan point to a deceleration.",
        "Some members stated that growth forecasts for these three economies have been revised downwards.",
        "One member noted that these revisions reflect the negative surprises observed for economic activity at the beginning of 2018.",
        "As for monetary policy in advanced economies, one member pointed out that, in general terms, monetary policy expectations in these economies exhibited only a few adjustments.",
        "The same member added that, although central banks have warned about the risks associated with the increasing protectionism worldwide, economic activity in this group of countries has been growing.",
        "Delving into the case of the U.S., most members highlighted that, as expected, the Federal Reserve kept the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged in its August meeting and reiterated its forecast of increasing it gradually.",
        "Some members pointed out that the forecast of two additional 25 basis points (bps) raises for the remainder of the year prevails.",
        "One member emphasized that the U.S. Federal Reserve has been facing the current economic environment in that country without major problems, by raising its reference rate gradually and through its forward guidance on monetary policy.",
        "Most members mentioned certain factors that might heighten inflationary pressures and affect the trajectory of interest rates in the U.S., such as labor market tightness, fiscal stimulus measures, and the protectionist policies announced.",
        "Another member highlighted that the yield curve of Treasury bonds is relatively flat, which apparently reflects, on the one hand, the expectation of gradual increases in shortterm interest rates and, on the other hand, that the conditions that led to a low term premia have prevailed.",
        "The same member concluded that monetary policy normalization in the short term is currently subject to greater risks and to an environment of higher uncertainty, albeit being planned and announced as a gradual and smooth process.",
        "The same member added that, in the long run, there seem to persist conditions in markets that imply a low inflation rate.",
        "Regarding monetary policy in other advanced economies, one member mentioned that the European Central Bank kept its reference rates unchanged, partly due to a weaker-than-expected economic performance and to the fact that the level of inflation is below the central bank target, which suggests that this institution has adopted a slightly more accommodative policy stance than expected.",
        "Regarding the Bank of Japan, the same member highlighted that it also kept its reference rate unchanged and committed to maintain a highly accommodative monetary policy for a longer period, by controlling the yield curve and introducing guidance on the likely path of interest rates.",
        "As for the Bank of England, the same member pointed out that, despite its favorable development, inflation remains above the 2% target in the United Kingdom, adding that, given the strong wage pressures, inflation expectations have remained at the highest level in the last four years.",

        "In this regard, some members concluded that a gradual withdrawal of the monetary stimulus in these countries continues to be expected.",
        "One member stated such process is foreseen to be faster in the U.S. than in other advanced economies.",
        "As for emerging economies, one member noted that the forecast of moderate economic activity growth rates is maintained for this year and 2019, which means that these economies would accumulate four consecutive years of increasing GDP growth.",
        "Nevertheless, some members mentioned that the forecasts to growth for these economies were revised downwards.",
        "One member pointed out that, as for Asian economies, this was due to the contraction of trade flows in recent months.",

        "One member highlighted that the growth forecast for oil-exporting countries has increased slightly.",
        "In this context, some members pointed out that there is also divergence in growth rates of emerging economies.",
        "As for inflation in these economies, one member added that, in most cases, incoming data shows that inflation remains below the set targets; however, in some cases, they have been affected by the depreciation of their local currencies and, in other cases, by the rise in fuel prices.",
        "The same member noted that, in order to cope with this situation, the respective central banks have opted for a more cautious rhetoric and are expected to adopt a more restrictive stance in their next monetary policy decisions.",
        "Most members pointed out that international financial markets exhibited episodes of volatility in recent weeks.",
        "Some members added that risk aversion has increased and that a high sensitivity to the escalation of trade tensions between the U.S. and other countries has been observed.",

        "The same member added that those of 10- and increases of around 95 and 45 bps, respectively, during the same period.",
        "Most members highlighted the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.",
        "One of the members stated that the latter is associated with the expectation of a higher growth of U.S. aggregate demand relative to other advanced economies, partly as a result of the fiscal stimulus in that country.",
        "Another member noted that the monetary policy normalization process of the U.S. Federal Reserve has also implied a depreciation of emerging economies’ currencies of between 1% and 4%.",
        "Looking ahead, one member pointed out that the U.S. dollar is expected to continue appreciating in real terms for the following quarters.",
        "The same member also mentioned that U.S. monetary conditions are tightening in two ways: through the increase in short-term interest rates, and through the nominal appreciation of the U.S. dollar, which, in turn, has led to a certain tightening of financial conditions.",
        "As for other asset and primary commodity prices, one member stated that stock prices of the automotive sector fell significantly given the possibility of the U.S. imposing new tariffs on automobile imports, while the prices of industrial metals have undergone a downward adjustment given the possible weakening of economic activity and the subsequent lower demand for commodities.",
        "In this regard, another member added that the prices of commodities are not expected to increase significantly in the near future, and that even the oil futures curve does not show signs of oil prices increasing sharply in the short term and that they show a significant amount of contango.",
        "Looking ahead, most members added that risks are perceived in the short term, such as those previously described for world economic growth, which may continue generating volatility in international financial markets.",
        "Some members noted that, in this environment, there could be greater increases in interest rates and an additional strengthening of the U.S. dollar, as well as a significant decline in appetite for risk and capital outflows from emerging economies.",
        "One of the members added that the aforementioned could intensify if a more adverse environment for international trade materializes.",
        "In regards to China, another member referred to the possible effect of the fiscal and monetary easing recently announced by this country on financial markets.",
        "The same member pointed out that, although the Chinese authorities have stated that these policies are aimed at avoiding the effects arising from the trade tensions and other external sources of uncertainty on domestic demand, they may exert additional pressures on their currency and elevate the risks associated with the increasing indebtedness in China.",
        "All members of the Governing Board noted that timely indicators suggest that during the second quarter of 2018 Mexico’s economic activity contracted as compared to the previous quarter.",
        "In this regard, one member pointed out there appears to be evidence of such a slowdown on both supply and demand indicators.",
        "On the aggregate demand side, most members mentioned that there was a reversion in the dynamism exhibited by investment in the previous quarter and a weakening of exports, while private consumption showed a positive evolution.",
        "One member stated that the behavior of aggregate demand reflects the continuing adjustment of the economy to an environment of high uncertainty, a decreasing availability of external funding, and of a depreciation of the real exchange rate.",
        "Some members explained that the growth of investment decreased both in the component of construction, due to the fading effects of the reconstruction efforts after the earthquakes of 2017, as well as in imported machinery and equipment.",
        "One member reiterated that such behavior is mainly due to the persisting environment of uncertainty arising from both domestic and external factors.",
        "The same member pointed out that manufacturing exports could be affected in part by the weaker rate of growth of world trade and particularly by its effect on exports to countries other than the U.S.",
        "In regards to production, some members mentioned the contraction of the primary sector, while most members noted that the secondary sector continues to exhibit a lack of dynamism while the tertiary sector is showing signs of decelerating.",

        "In this regard, one member added that it is also associated to the deceleration in manufacturing production.",
        "Most members pointed out that in 2018 GDP growth is anticipated to fall to the lower part of the estimated range (2 to 3%), as specified in the latest Quarterly Report.",
        "Most members highlighted that this forecast is due to the weakness exhibited during the second quarter of the year.",
        "One member added that it also reflects the outlook that investment will remain weak in the following quarters.",
        "Another member noted that, taking into account that the first half of the year has ended, this adjustment of half a percentage point in the forecast to growth is significant, and that it implied an adjustment to this member’s outlook for growth and inflation for the next months.",
        "Notwithstanding the above, most members pointed out that the forecast of a stronger growth for 2019 prevails, although some members mentioned that an environment of higher uncertainty is expected for that year.",
        "In this regard, one of the members stated that, under current conditions, it is difficult to make an assessment of the evolution of economic activity during the second half of 2018 and in 2019.",
        "Most members noted that, given the uncertainty generated by the complex environment faced by the Mexican economy, the balance of risks for growth maintains a bias to the downside.",
        "Beside the aforementioned global risks, most members mentioned the uncertainty associated with the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) renegotiation and the outlook for the U.S.-Mexico bilateral relation.",
        "In this regard, some members pointed out that, despite the recent signs of a positive outcome, the risks of a prolonged NAFTA renegotiation or an unfavorable outcome cannot be dismissed, which can continue to have an effect on domestic demand, particularly on investment.",
        "One member mentioned as an additional risk the possibility that oil production remains significantly below the levels programmed for the remaining of associated with the strategies, policies and plans of the incoming administration.",
        "In this regard, one member stated that the absence of details about the actions that the new administration will implement in different areas also entails risks to domestic demand during the second half of 2018 and in 2019.",
        "The same member also emphasized the possibility of a reduction of total public spending during the second half of this year, as has been the case in previous election years.",
        "Among the medium- and long-term risks to potential growth, another member noted the possible modification of the fiscal policy stance by the incoming administration, as well as the deterioration of Mexico’s conditions of access to international trade.",
        "Finally, one member highlighted the uncertainty regarding the necessary measures to increase the productivity of the country and its adequate use of productive factors.",
        "Most members pointed out that slack conditions in the Mexican economy are estimated to have eased and that forecasts to growth would imply output gaps that are wider than those previously expected for the following quarters.",
        "In this regard, one of the members stated that the economy is anticipated to grow even below potential during the next quarters and that the output gap will near zero in 2019.",
        "The same member emphasized that these forecasts imply that slack conditions would ease at a faster pace than expected, which could have significant consequences on the path of core inflation in the next months.",
        "Most members noted that labor market indicators remain tight.",
        "In this regard, one of the members highlighted that the national unemployment rate apparently stabilized at around rate of unemployment (NAIRU) estimate.",
        "Another member pointed out that the latest data indicates a lower growth of formal employment and an increase in the unemployment rate, although it is too early to draw conclusions from these figures.",
        "Some members noted that the indicators of slack conditions do not reflect demand-related pressures on inflation.",
        "Another member emphasized that, although wage indicators have exhibited moderate increases, they could be subject to pressures in view of the absence of slack in the labor market.",
        "The same member also stated that, for this reason, wage revisions must be thoroughly assessed in order to fully identify their effects on the economy’s price formation process.",
        "The same member added that, in this context, the alternatives proposed for revising various wage indicators should consider productivity gains and do not entail generalized cost pressures on the economy.",
        "As for headline inflation, all members agreed that after the fall observed at the beginning of the year, it increased in June.",
        "Most members mentioned that in the first half of July 2018 inflation reached 4.85%, after having posted 4.65% in June and 4.51% in May.",
        "All members considered that this increase is explained mainly by the growth in the non-core inflation component, due to the upward adjustment in the prices of gasolines and L.P. gas.",
        "All members noted that the indirect effects of the price increases of these products have also had an impact on core inflation.",
        "One member highlighted that fundamental core inflation does not suggest any cyclical pressures on prices.",
        "Most members stated that in recent months headline inflation has been affected by the aforementioned shocks.",
        "One member pointed out that, in a more adverse environment, and with considerable elements of domestic uncertainty, some of the risks to the upside for inflation have materialized.",
        "In this regard, the same member mentioned that the Mexican peso exchange rate has been subject to episodes of volatility, despite its recent appreciation, and that non-core inflation has been subject to the energy-product shocks mentioned above.",
        "As for non-core inflation, some members pointed out that it continued to increase, reaching 8.15% during the first half of July, after having posted 7.79% in June and 6.99% in May.",
        "In this regard, one member emphasized that energy prices have escalated above expectations, due mainly to the reduction in the fiscal stimuli applied to these products, as well as to the upward adjustment in their international references.",
        "Another member added that the contribution of energy products to the rise in inflation during the first half of July was above that registered in January 2017.",
        "As for core inflation, most members mentioned that it reached 3.64% during the first half of July, after having posted 3.62% in June and 3.69% in May.",
        "Some members noted that the development of core inflation has been in line with forecasts, exhibiting a downward trend during the entire year.",
        "One member emphasized that core inflation is the component that responds more clearly to the monetary policy stance.",
        "Another member considered that core inflation has declined at a slower rate than expected.",
        "Finally, one member mentioned that there are several additional risks to be considered regarding the recent developments in inflation and its components.",
        "The same member mentioned that in the first half of July, the percentage of components of the CPI basket with annualized monthly increases below or equal to 3% decreased to levels below the several months.",
        "The same member added that the analysis of inflation dynamics considering frequency and time (wavelets) suggests that inflation’s trend component has decreased very gradually, for both headline and core inflation.",
        "Most members mentioned that headline inflation expectations for the end of 2018 were adjusted from the end of 2019 remained around 3.60% and those for the medium and long terms remained around the target.",
        "In this regard, some members mentioned that the latter has been taking place for a long period.",
        "Some members noted that core inflation expectations for the end of 2018 increased from the spread between nominal and real government security yields, some members pointed out that these have shown an upturn as a reflection of the increase in inflation risk premia, although one member considered that such premia have remained at relatively stable levels.",
        "Regarding the foreseen trajectory for headline inflation, most members agreed that the change in relative prices stemming from the increase in energy prices affects the expected trajectory for headline inflation for the next twelve months, although this effect is estimated to be of a transitory nature.",
        "One member noted that inflation is expected to return to a downward trend in August, which would continue during the rest of 2018 and in 2019.",
        "As for core inflation, most members expect it will continue falling in the time frame in which monetary policy operates.",
        "Some members considered that attaining the inflation target during the period in which monetary policy exerts an influence will be difficult.",
        "One member mentioned that, in general terms, the speed at which headline and core inflation are declining appears to be too slow to attain the target within the time frame expected by Banco de México.",
        "Nevertheless, the same member noted that considering the latest information on economic activity, the economy’s cyclical conditions will probably loosen further, a situation that could in turn make headline and core inflation fall more rapidly in the next quarters.",
        "The same member stated that, in the absence of additional supply-related shocks or of episodes of volatility that could affect the exchange rate, this scenario is what, in this member’s opinion, makes feasible the convergence of inflation to its target within the expected time frame.",
        "The same member mentioned, nevertheless, that even in such a scenario, there is a high risk of inflation not converging to its target within the anticipated time frame.",
        "Most members agreed that the balance of risks for the expected trajectory of inflation continues biased to the upside, in an environment of high uncertainty.",
        "One member mentioned that such balance did not deteriorate since the last monetary policy decision, although another member said that the prevailing uncertain environment makes its assessment difficult.",
        "The majority of members stated that among the main risks to the upside are that the peso exchange rate continues to be subject to external pressures such as the higher foreign interest rates and the U.S. dollar strength, and to factors of uncertainty that persist in both the domestic and external fronts, such as the NAFTA renegotiation.",
        "In this regard, one member also noted the still important possibility of a negative NAFTA outcome, as mentioned before, stating, however, that this risk has decreased.",
        "The same member also pointed out that the inflation’s high current levels could generate hysteresis in the economy’s price formation process.",
        "In this context, the same member noted that there is the possibility of facing a cyclical stage in which inflation persistently remains above its target, while the economy decelerates sharply.",
        "Another member mentioned that the risk of shocks to one or several of the items that compose the non-core inflation price basket is always present.",
        "In this regard, some members pointed out that the risk of further increases in the prices of some energy products or of agricultural products persists.",
        "Some members highlighted that a factor to consider are the effects of the possible changes in the incoming administration’s economic policy.",
        "One member noted that among these measures could be a change in the policy for setting minimum wages.",
        "The same member stated that the tighter conditions in the labor market could generate risks to prices, although acknowledging that no demand-related pressures on inflation are anticipated and that the risks from the demand side apparently have decreased.",
        "Another member mentioned that the revision of nominal contractual wages, which is now at 5.6%, could begin to translate into increases in unit labor costs.",
        "Another member noted the risk of a deterioration in the fiscal position, which is structurally very vulnerable.",
        "The same member also warned of the possibility of an adverse inflationary surprise in the United States, despite considerations of a structural flattening of the Phillips curve in that country, which could have serious consequences for international financial markets.",
        "The same member also mentioned that a change in sentiment in these markets towards Mexico cannot be ruled out, and that the recent cases of several emerging economies –such as South Africa, Turkey, Brazil and Argentina– reveal how suddenly these changes can take place.",
        "Lastly, some members considered that there is the risk of U.S. trade policy actions leading to an escalation of protectionist and countervailing measures that could affect inflation negatively.",
        "As for the risks to the downside, some members highlighted a possible appreciation of the Mexican peso if the NAFTA renegotiations turn out to be favorable.",
        "All members pointed out that since the last monetary policy decision, the Mexican peso appreciated and exhibited lower volatility.",
        "Some members noted that of the main emerging economies, the Mexican peso was the currency that appreciated the most.",
        "Most members agreed that such results were partly the consequence of the lesser levels of uncertainty since Mexico’s presidential and legislative elections and as a result of a more optimistic outlook regarding the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) renegotiation and of the raise of 25 bps in Banco de México’s monetary policy target rate announced in June.",
        "Some members added that the recent behavior of the exchange rate was also the result of investors’ anticipating that Mexico will continue to have fiscal and monetary policy stances that contribute to an orderly adjustment of the Mexican economy and financial markets.",
        "Some members noted that, in this context, an improvement in the operating conditions of the exchange market has been observed.",
        "In particular, this members expressed that there has been greater liquidity and depth in this market, as well as an increase in net long derivatives positions on the Mexican peso.",
        "Most members indicated that this more favorable environment has also been reflected in the behavior of the prices of other assets.",
        "Some members mentioned that both short and longterm interest rates decreased moderately.",
        "One member stated that the latter has led to a slight steepening of the yield curve.",
        "Another member highlighted that an improvement in bond market operating conditions has also been observed, as well as capital flows from foreign investors to assets denominated in Mexican pesos, mainly to mediumterm instruments.",
        "Some mentioned that sovereign risk indicators improved.",
        "One of the members specified that domestic financial markets have exhibited a favorable performance.",
        "On the other hand, most members noted that, looking head, there are risk factors that could affect domestic financial markets, particularly, the Mexican peso exchange rate.",
        "Among such risks they included the uncertainty surrounding NAFTA renegotiations, the higher levels of external interest rates, surprises regarding the process of normalization of monetary policy in the U.S., and, the worldwide escalation of protectionist trade measures.",
        "One member added also the uncertainty among investors regarding the economic package to be presented to Mexico’s Congress by the incoming federal administration.",
        "One member indicated that the recent behavior of financial markets highlights the importance of having a sound management of macroeconomic policy.",
        "Some members stated that the economy is expected to continue facing a complex environment, both in the external and domestic fronts.",
        "For this reason, it is particularly relevant that, in addition to following a prudent and robust monetary policy, measures to foster greater productivity are adopted and public finances are consolidated sustainably.",
        "One member pointed out that this strategy would reduce the probability of having to face a sudden recomposition of portfolios and capital outflows.",
        "Some members mentioned that over the next months one crucial element for preserving a robust macroeconomic policy will be the actions regarding public finances that the incoming administration will announce and implement.",
        "One member specified that, in the short term, possible doubts regarding the consistency between some of the initiatives presented by the incoming administration and strengthening the fiscal position should be clarified.",
        "The same member mentioned that it will also be important to take actions to ensure the soundness of public finances in the long term, in light of the possible pressures arising from public spending in items such as pension payment obligations, health spending, and the financial cost of federal government debt.",
        "In this member’s opinion, spending in state-owned productive enterprises’ investment that the new administration is considering should also be added to the aforementioned.",
        "Another member mentioned that some of the members of the newly elected president’s economic team have announced that a responsible fiscal policy will be maintained in order to continue preserving sound macroeconomic fundamentals.",
        "The same member added that the aforementioned is a necessary condition so that Banco de México can fully meet its constitutional mandate.",
        "Most members pointed out the relevance of raising productivity levels and, in turn, the Mexican economy’s growth potential, which, according to one of the members, stands currently around 2.5%.",
        "Most members mentioned that in order to achieve this, it is important to improve the rule of law and reduce public insecurity levels, corruption, and impunity.",
        "One member stressed that the magnitude of such a challenge requires building on the already attained achievements and adopting the required measures, both on the economic and institutional fronts, to make progress in that direction.",
        "The same member also pointed out that raising investment levels is also necessary, since as a share of GDP the latter has fallen to its lowest level in three years, and almost 1 percentage point below that observed in 2008.",
        "In this regard, the same member mentioned that it is necessary to give certainty to private investors as to the actions that the incoming administration will adopt in key areas and assess carefully how to create room for the recovery of public investment.",
        "All members pointed out that the most relevant factor to consider for the monetary policy decision is that the effects of the changes in relative prices on headline inflation are forecasted to be temporary.",
        "Most members also stated that medium- and longterm inflation expectations have remained stable.",
        "Most members also added the forecast that slack conditions in the economy will continue easing, which reduces the possibility of pressures stemming from aggregate demand.",
        "Considering the aforementioned, most members emphasized that core inflation continues on a downward trend and is expected to continue falling.",
        "Another member highlighted that, under the scenarios foreseen for Mexico’s economy, the current monetary policy stance is consistent with a convergence of headline inflation to the 3% target in the time frame in which monetary policy operates fully.",
        "One member added that Banco de México should continue with the same current policy stance as long as inflation does not follow a clear downward trend, particularly of its core component.",
        "Most members also agreed that, given the current economic environment, it is important to follow a prudent monetary policy stance.",
        "One member pointed out that this is essential in a context where major risks persist.",
        "Another member added that there are no historical precedents for some of these risks and that they may materialize anytime, and even simultaneously.",
        "In this regard, one member stated that, in the case of an adverse environment that requires an adjustment of the real exchange rate, previsions must be taken to ensure that medium- and long-term inflation expectations are not affected and that no second-round effects on in the economy’s price formation process emerge.",
        "In this regard, some members pointed out that, in general terms, the monetary policy stance must prevent any additional inflationary pressures from contaminating the economy’s price formation process and from putting at risk the convergence of headline inflation to its target.",
        "In this regard, one member pointed out that monetary policy faces a situation of inflationary pressures above those expected.",
        "The same member mentioned that, however, these pressures are the result of supply shocks, in the absence of demandrelated pressures on prices, with core inflation following a path consistent with forecasts, and without evidence of second-round effects on inflation.",
        "The same member stated that although in these circumstances an immediate monetary policy response is not justified, a prudent stance must be maintained, since under an uncertain environment, with a balance of risks for inflation to the upside, and where it will be apparently difficult to achieve the inflation target during the period of influence of monetary policy, there is a high risk of second round effects, including a de-anchoring of long-term inflation expectations.",
        "In this context, some members mentioned that additional rises of the target rate cannot be ruled out, while one member highlighted that Banco de México should clearly indicate this possibility in its communications.",
        "Furthermore, one member delved into the factors to consider for conducting Mexico’s monetary policy.",
        "The same member mentioned that the current levels of short-term rates implies that their spreads in relation to those of the U.S. remain at prudently high levels, although the spread between Mexico and U.S. inflation has narrowed.",
        "The same member considered that the aforementioned situation is appropriate since the spread of term premia between both countries has remained relatively stable, and there is also the persisting possibility of volatility episodes or shocks that could result in a depreciation of the real exchange rate.",
        "The same member also added that monetary conditions have tightened further, not only due to the present level of interest rates, but also to the appreciation of the Mexican peso exchange rate.",
        "The same member also expressed concern because inflation has been slow in converging to Banco de México’s target than as previously expected.",
        "The same member emphasized that this is taking place in an environment where economic activity is decelerating.",
        "The same member also mentioned that apparently there is certain degree of economic inertia that would be consistent with the forecast that long-term inflation expectations will remain at 3.5% instead of 3%.",
        "The same member noted that this could be due to the presence of different channels that generate inflation persistence and make inflation exhibit a strong resistance to the downside as well as to the need for Banco de México to strengthen the credibility of its 3% target.",
        "The same member pointed out that the prevailing uncertainty may represent a hindrance to achieving the convergence of inflation to its target, despite Banco de México’s prudent and consistent conduction of monetary policy.",
        "The same member also expressed concern about the possibility of a situation where inflation is persistently above its target while simultaneously there is a sharp slowdown of economic growth, even to below potential levels.",
        "The same member stated that, in this context, monetary policy becomes less effective since one of the most important channels through which it operates is that of aggregate demand.",
        "The same member highlighted that the aforementioned situation may prevent inflation, particularly its core component, from converging to the 3% target during the expected time period.",
        "Some members pointed out that, given that monetary policy is implemented within an inflation-forecasttargeting framework, the governing board must explain clearly and with detail the reasons for possible deviations of inflation from its target.",
        "The same members agreed that in the event of supply shocks on prices, it will generally be possible to explain credibly the deviation of inflation from the forecasted trajectory, the absence of a monetary policy response, and Banco de México’s commitment to attaining the inflation target.",
        "One member stated that even in the presence of shocks that would justify a change in the monetary policy stance, for instance, when there is evidence or a risk of second-round effects on prices, postponing the attainment of the inflation target can be justified, as long as the monetary policy response to these shocks is deemed appropriate, and consistent with the attainment of the inflation target, although in a reasonably longer period.",
        "Another member explained that it is important to communicate the time frame in which inflation is expected to reach its target, as well as provide guidance on how Banco de México responds to different types of shocks in order to re-optimizing its monetary policy stance so that it is consistent with the fulfillment of the target in the referred time frame.",
        "All members agreed that the message of Banco de México should be that of its commitment to reach the inflation target.",
        "The members stated that, given that headline inflation is being affected by the fluctuations in the relative prices of products corresponding to its non-core component, due attention must be paid to the behavior of core inflation, especially because it is the component that responds the most to monetary policy.",
        "As stated in the monetary policy statement released August 2 of 2018, in order to guide its monetary policy actions, Banco de México’s Governing Board follows closely the development of inflation vis-à-vis its anticipated trajectory, taking into account the monetary policy stance adopted and the time frame in which monetary policy operates, as well as available information on all inflation determinants and on medium- and long-term inflation expectations, including the balance of risks for such factors.",
        "Given the Mexican economy’s recent developments and, in particular, that the shocks that have affected inflation recently are of a transitory nature, and considering that core inflation is expected to continue on a downward trend, Banco de México’s Governing Board has voted unanimously to maintain the target for the overnight interbank interest rate unchanged at Looking ahead, the Governing Board will maintain a prudent monetary policy stance and will continue to follow closely the potential pass-through of exchange rate fluctuations to prices, the monetary policy stance relative to that of the U.S., and the conditions of slack in the Mexican economy.",
        "In the presence and possible persistence of factors that, by their nature, involve risks to both inflation and inflation expectations, monetary policy will be adjusted in a timely and robust manner to achieve the convergence of inflation to its 3% target and to firmly anchor medium- and long-term inflation expectations so that they attain such target.",
        "Members voting in favor of this decision: Alejandro Díaz de León Carrillo, Roberto Del Cueto Legaspi, Irene Espinosa Cantellano, Javier Eduardo Guzmán Calafell and Manuel Ramos Francia voted in favor of maintaining the target rate unchanged at",
        "All members agreed that during the second quarter of 2018, the world economy continued to grow at a moderate pace, and that the divergence among the main advanced economies’ performance increased.",
        "In this context, some members mentioned that the outlook for world economic activity has deteriorated due partly to the materialization of some risks, such as the intensification of trade disputes.",
        "Some members agreed that the balance of risks to the world economy continues biased to the downside.",
        "All members agreed that the world economy is subject to a high degree of uncertainty and that the following are major risks: I) a further escalation of international trade disputes; ii) a further tightening of financial conditions; and, iii) political and geopolitical factors.",
        "As for the risks of greater protectionist measures, some members pointed out that the number and intensity of these actions has been increasing significantly.",
        "They also stated that evidence shows that such measures are already affecting world trade volume and capital expenditure, as well as indicators of production, business confidence and household confidence.",
        "One member mentioned that available indicators suggest that the effect of these measures has started to be evidenced in economies and regions other than those directly involved in such disputes.",
        "Most members noted that the intensity of the trade disputes has differed across countries.",
        "In some cases, such intensity seems to have eased, as in the case of the trade negotiations between Mexico, the U.S. and Canada; whereas in other cases, like the trade dispute between China and the U.S., it has worsened.",
        "One member highlighted the relevance of the Chinese-U.S. case for the world economy, given the size of both economies and their high share in global value chains.",
        "As for the second risk to the global economy, most members mentioned the possibility of the U.S. economy facing higher-than-expected inflationary pressures, while one member stated that this situation could lead to significant increases in the yield curve.",
        "As for the risk related to political and geopolitical factors, some members stated that in the Eurozone some vulnerabilities associated with domestic turmoil and political differences have increased, stating as an example those related to the approval of the budgetary process in Italy, the Brexit, the U.S. midterm elections in November, and Brazil’s presidential elections.",
        "In addition to the aforementioned risks, some members included the possibility of international prices of crude oil and other energy goods continuing on an upward trend, which could affect economic activity and inflation worldwide.",
        "In this regard, one member emphasized that the increase in oil prices responds to several factors, such as a greater demand in the United States, the inelastic supply by OPEC countries, and the effects of the U.S. trade sanctions imposed to Iran.",
        "Most members stated that the divergence among the main advanced economies’ performance has increased.",
        "They also mentioned that, in contrast with the Eurozone, Japan and the U.K., which have grown below expectations, economic activity in the U.S. exhibited higher growth, partly in response to the fiscal stimulus implemented.",
        "Most members warned that, under conditions of reduced slack in the economy, the greater dynamism of the U.S. economy could exert greater pressure on inflation.",
        "As for the prospects for growth for the U.S. economy, such members expressed that they expect it to continue growing at a high rate in the next semesters.",
        "Some members highlighted that the latter is due to the strength of consumption and investment in that country, associated with the high levels of household and business confidence indicators, and with the low levels of unemployment.",
        "However, another member pointed out that, in the medium run, the cyclical position of the U.S. economy could start being a factor that could hinder its dynamism.",
        "As to other advanced economies, one member mentioned that weak economic activity in the Eurozone, Japan and the United Kingdom this year was a factor that contributed to revise downward the forecasts for growth for these countries, to rates below potential.",
        "Some members mentioned that, in most advanced economies, labor markets have tightened further and their unemployment rates are below their natural levels.",
        "One member added that, up to this point, wages do not seem to be subject to pressures.",
        "As for emerging economies, one member mentioned that these exhibited slower dynamism than the observed in previous quarters and have also faced tighter financial conditions, in a scenario where advanced economies are foreseen to raise their interest rates.",
        "In the case of the Chinese economy, some members indicated that it has been struck by the effects of the intensifying trade disputes with the U.S. and the environment of uncertainty that this situation generates.",
        "In this regard, these members pointed out that the outlook for manufacturing activity, capital expenditure and business confidence has been particularly affected.",
        "Most members added that indicators for other emerging economies, such as Argentina and Turkey, have deteriorated.",
        "In this context, one member underlined that although problems differ among economies, there are two common factors: an inadequate macroeconomic – particularly fiscal- management, and an institutional weakness related, principally, to central bank independence.",
        "As for expectations for growth for emerging economies, one member stated that they have been revised downwards and that greater differences have been observed among countries.",
        "The same member mentioned that in Latin America, expectations for growth have been revised downwards due to the slowdown of global trade growth and to various idiosyncratic factors, whereas another member added that growth expectations for most crude oil exporting countries have improved significantly.",
        "Some members stated that in the main advanced economies, headline inflation continues converging to their central banks’ targets, albeit one of them added that core inflation has remained below such targets.",
        "Some members pointed out that in the United States, inflation has fluctuated around the Federal Reserve’s target, while in the Eurozone and Japan it has remained below their central banks’ targets.",
        "In this context, some members indicated that given the tightening labor markets in these economies, in the future wages are expected to have greater effects on prices.",
        "As for emerging economies, some members mentioned that inflation has trended upward gradually.",
        "One member noted that in these economies, the outlook for inflation is heterogeneous and that the risks of higher inflation have escalated in several of them.",
        "In this regard, one member added that pressures related to the exchange rates’ depreciation could deteriorate even further the outlook for inflation in emerging economies.",
        "In light of the above, most members mentioned that world inflation has increased, and that the higher prices of energy have contributed to such results.",
        "Some emphasized that the central banks of both advanced and emerging economies have stressed the possibility of inflationary pressures arising in the short term due to the escalation of trade protectionist measures.",
        "One member warned that, in the short term, the balance of risks for world inflation is biased to the upside, although with some differences across countries.",
        "All members mentioned that differences in the rate of monetary policy normalization are expected among the main advanced economies.",
        "Some members pointed out that such divergence is a reflection of the different stages of the business cycle each of these economies is currently undergoing.",
        "In the case of the United States, most members highlighted that, as anticipated, in September the Federal Reserve increased the target for the federal funds rate and reiterated its prevision of increasing it gradually, causing a rise in interest rates in all terms.",
        "One member added that the latter was mainly observed in short-term interest rates and, hence, the yield curve remained relatively flat.",
        "The same member mentioned that, in particular, the 5-year interest rate was already at levels above 3%, while those of 30 years are already above 3.3%.",
        "Such member expressed that these figures show that term premia are still at low levels.",
        "Most members highlighted that, in the event of inflationary surprises in the U.S., there is a risk of a faster-than-expected process of monetary policy normalization in that country.",
        "One member mentioned that such inflationary surprises could be due to demand-related pressures, given the reduced slack in the U.S. economy, or to the passthrough of import tariffs imposed by the U.S. onto final prices in that country.",
        "In this regard, another member made reference to the discussion about the process of price formation in that country, and the flattening of the Phillips curve, which suggests that inflation’s response to the slack conditions in the U.S. has been small.",
        "The same member added that several explanations have been proposed to describe this phenomenon, such as: globalization’s disciplinary effect on prices and wages, productivity gains related to automation, large businesses’ monopsonic position in labor markets, and the effects through time of the presence of large e-commerce retailers on the economy’s price formation process.",
        "Such member pointed out that despite such explanations, a high degree of uncertainty persists as to the price formation process in the United States, which increases the probability of inflationary surprises.",
        "Such member highlighted that the risk is not so much that inflation increases in an environment where monetary policy normalization is done gradually and with transparency, but rather that inflationary surprises emerge.",
        "Some members added that, in contrast with expectations for the United States, those for Japan and the Eurozone point to a barely moderate monetary policy adjustment over a longer period.",
        "One of them mentioned that, in England, the central bank has maintained the projected pace of normalization, despite the inflationary pressures it faces.",
        "Finally, the same member pointed out that, among emerging economies, tighter monetary policy stances are also anticipated.",
        "In particular, this member stressed the case of Argentina, whose central bank adopted recently a monetary policy framework based on a target for the monetary base.",
        "All members pointed out that international financial markets have undergone episodes of volatility and considered that the prices of emerging economies’ assets have performed negatively in recent weeks.",
        "Some members mentioned that this has occurred in an environment of U.S. dollar strength and interest rate increases.",
        "Most members stated that the lower risk appetite observed in the last months has already caused both an adjustment of investment portfolios and capital outflows from some emerging economies.",
        "In this regard, most members added that differences among these economies were observed depending on macroeconomic fundamentals and idiosyncratic factors inherent to each of these countries.",
        "These members highlighted that, in the foreseeable future, an environment of higher external interest rates and U.S. dollar appreciation is expected, which would lead to a greater tightening of financial conditions that will particularly affect emerging economies.",
        "As for the risks to international financial markets, most members emphasized those previously described about world economic growth, as well as those associated with sharp adjustments in these markets, which would have a considerable effect on financial asset prices.",
        "Most members mentioned that the latest information suggests that, at the beginning of the third quarter of having contracted during the second quarter.",
        "One member noted that this contraction was preceded by two quarters of growth recovery.",
        "As for aggregate demand, most members highlighted the higher dynamism of exports.",
        "As for consumption, some members pointed out that timely indicators suggest a moderate recovery after the stagnation observed during the previous quarter.",
        "Some members coincided that investment has remained weak.",
        "As for production, most members argued that its performance is explained by the growth of services and the slight recovery of industrial activity.",
        "One member mentioned the favorable change in the trend of construction, while some members noted the recovery of manufacturing and the continuing deterioration of mining.",
        "In this regard, one member noted that this deterioration has been observed mainly in crude oil extraction.",
        "One member pointed out that, after the fluctuations observed in previous months resulting mainly from the natural disasters at the end of 2017, the trajectory of economic activity is expected to normalize throughout the second half of the year.",
        "In line with the above, another member noted that, after the growth forecasts of Banco de México’s latest Quarterly Report were revised downwards, the baseline scenario for growth for both 2018 and 2019 remains unchanged.",
        "Another member added that expectations for growth slightly below potential during both this year and 2019 prevail.",
        "Most members argued that GDP growth for 2018 and 2019 is expected to be between 2.0 and 2.6% and 1.8 and México’s latest Quarterly Report.",
        "Some members mentioned that the forecast for 2019 is subject to a high degree of uncertainty and consider several challenges, such as the incoming administration’s implementation of public policy, a slight weakness in the aggregate demand components, and the low levels of crude oil production.",
        "Most members stated that, given the complex environment the economy is currently facing, the balance of risks to growth remains biased to the downside, although such bias has decreased at the margin as a result of the trade agreement recently reached with the U.S. and Canada.",
        "One member stated that the announcement of the new agreement is, undoubtedly, positive news that may contribute to strengthen confidence in Mexico.",
        "One member explained that, although the ratification process will be lengthy, which could give rise to uncertainty, this should decrease significantly as compared to that observed prior to the announcement, and therefore help to boost domestic demand and, particularly, private investment.",
        "Most members stated that there is a risk of uncertainty as to the length of the ratification process, that Congress does not ratify it or that challenges arise in the implementation of some chapters of the agreement.",
        "On top of the aforementioned global risks, some members mentioned as an additional risk to growth, the deceleration of public expenditure that is generally observed at the beginning of a new administration.",
        "In this same regard, most members pointed out that relevant details of the economic agenda of the incoming administration remain to be explained.",
        "Some members mentioned that another risk is for crude oil production to remain significantly below the expected levels.",
        "Among the risks to medium- and long-term growth, some members included the possible loss of efficiency and productivity of the Mexican economy, as well as the possible impact to competitiveness caused by domestic factors, such as the deterioration of public security.",
        "One member added other factors such as corruption, impunity, and the absence of the rule of law, which affect investment prospects.",
        "Another member also included the risk of deviating from the ongoing fiscal consolidation process and public policies that would affect potential growth, as well as an eventual slowdown of the U.S. economy.",
        "Most members considered that the slack conditions in the economy are estimated to have remained similar to those observed during the second quarter, pointing out that the economy’s cyclical conditions continued to loosen vis-à-vis the levels observed at the beginning of 2018.",
        "One of the members emphasized that this is evident in practically all the different slack indicators monitored by Banco de México, except those related with the labor market.",
        "However, another member mentioned that several indicators currently suggest an output gap close to zero.",
        "As to the labor market, some members stated that its conditions remain tight.",
        "In this regard, one of the members pointed out that the unemployment rate is still at low levels and that although it has not undergone additional decreases, it has remained around its current level for a relatively long period.",
        "The same member added that unit labor costs for the overall economy have increased recently, though starting from low levels and, in general terms, no excessive wage pressures have been observed.",
        "Another member argued that wages have increased somewhat and that, for this reason, wage revisions should be assessed fully to identify their effects on the price formation process.",
        "In this regard, the same member stated that it is important that the different alternatives for wage revisions are associated with productivity gains and do not generate overall cost pressures on the economy.",
        "Another one stated that, in that member’s opinion, demand-related pressures stemming from such increases are a factor of greater concern.",
        "Finally, as to the forecasts for economic activity, some members pointed out that, if growth expectations for the rest of 2018 and for 2019 materialize, less tight cyclical conditions would be expected in the following quarters.",
        "Nevertheless, one of the members noted that these conditions would be consistent with an output gap not far from zero.",
        "Most members mentioned that headline inflation has been affected by the significant increases of its noncore component, emphasizing that, since June, higher-than-expected rises in energy prices have been observed, mainly those of gasoline and L.P. gas.",
        "Such members noted that these price increases stem from higher international references, stating that the gradual adjustments of domestic gasoline prices has made such increases more persistent.",
        "Some members pointed out that the contribution of energy prices to the increase in headline inflation was significant during the first half of September and larger than that exhibited in January 2017.",
        "One member specified that in such two-week period, gasoline prices registered an annual rate of change of above 21%, whereas L.P. gas prices of above annual headline inflation increased from 4.85% to of September, while non-core inflation did so from evolution of core inflation, most members highlighted that it has behaved according to expectations.",
        "The same members mentioned that the core component decreased from 3.64% to 3.56% between the first half of July and the first half of September.",
        "Nevertheless, most members noted that the rate at which core inflation has been declining has been contained by the indirect effects of non-core inflation on production costs.",
        "One member added that core inflation has shown a high degree of persistence, despite the deceleration of productive activity and the relatively more favorable behavior of the exchange rate.",
        "The same member added that fundamental core inflation figures, drawn from price index data, constructed with those items that are more sensitive to the business cycle, has fluctuated between 3.4% and 3.45% in the last five months.",
        "Most members mentioned that expectations for headline inflation for the end of 2018 were revised upwards from 4.25 to 4.50% from July to September, while those for the end of 2019 increased from 3.60 to 3.70% for the same period.",
        "One member highlighted that such expectations are reflecting the aforementioned shocks.",
        "Most members emphasized that medium- and long-term expectations remained around 3.50%.",
        "Some members observed that, although expectations have remained stable, they are still above the target.",
        "Most members also pointed out that expectations for core inflation for the end of the end of 2019 remained practically unchanged.",
        "Finally, one member underlined that the yield spread between nominal and real government bonds remains high, which suggests that markets are perceiving upside risks for headline inflation in the medium- and long-terms.",
        "All members agreed that, although the shocks that affected inflation in Mexico are of transitory nature, they have delayed the convergence of headline inflation to its target.",
        "One member added that noncore inflation is expected to remain high during the next months and will continue to be affected by pressures from energy prices, which will in turn affect the trajectory of headline inflation.",
        "Another member considered that the forecasts for inflation for the next months remain complex.",
        "Most members also stated that core inflation remains in line with forecasts and is expected to continue its downward trend towards anticipated to decrease, but at a slower rate.",
        "All members considered that the balance of risks to the forecasted trajectory of inflation remains biased upwards, in an environment of uncertainty where external and domestic risks persist.",
        "One member mentioned that, although some risks to inflation have decreased as a result of the recently approved trade agreement with the United States and Canada, other risks have intensified.",
        "Another member added that this balance deteriorated since the last monetary policy decision, mainly due to the rise in energy prices and expectations that they will continue to increase.",
        "One member argued that some of these risks are cyclical in nature, while others are of a more structural nature.",
        "The same member emphasized that both types of risks are operating in the same direction and reinforcing each other.",
        "Among the main risks to the upside, most members highlighted the possibility of pressures on the peso exchange rate due to external or domestic factors; a possible escalation of protectionist measures worldwide, which could affect inflation; additional upward pressures on energy prices, as indicated by the futures prices of some of these products; a possible reversion in the favorable behavior of agricultural products’ prices; and, the risk that wage negotiations are not consistent with productivity gains.",
        "In this regard, one member stated that wage pressures could appear as a result of the tight labor market conditions or the expected adjustment to minimum wages.",
        "Some members also noted the risk of higherthan-expected levels of public expenditure.",
        "One of the members emphasized that this could reduce the rate at which core inflation has been decreasing.",
        "Another member added the risk that the inertial trend of a greater participation of current expenditure in total government expenditure continues.",
        "Some members stated that, if supply shocks, such as those of energy prices, persist for a significant period, the probability of second-round effects in the price formation process could increase significantly.",
        "One of the members pointed out that the persistence of these shocks could also intensify the negative consequences that protectionist measures could have on inflation.",
        "Finally, another member considered that, on balance, the aforementioned factors jeopardize the convergence of inflation to the de México’s latest Quarterly Report.",
        "One member elaborated on the risks of a more structural nature, stressing that the persistence of inflation is currently high and that this may be due to various factors.",
        "The same member indicated that, in general terms, persistence is introduced into the inflationary process through formal and informal mechanisms that seek to protect economic agents from inflationary and/or exchange rate risk, and that these mechanisms are used in contracts or in other forms of determining transactions in the economy, in a context in which price formation does not seem to be consistent with the 3% target.",
        "Such member emphasized that there may be various reasons for this, but that long-term inflation expectations have remained at levels of around 3.5% for several years, and that this fact implies that economic agents assign a low probability to the event of attaining the 3% target.",
        "In this context, the same member mentioned the structural vulnerability of public finances as well as the uncertainty about the management of fiscal policy by the incoming administration.",
        "Such member also considered that the most relevant risk is the lack of total factor productivity growth in Mexico over the last two decades, stressing that under such conditions it is difficult to believe that the economy is in a good situation to efficiently absorb -that is, with a low inflationary impact- adverse shocks, such as those to the real exchange rate, the terms of trade, and to the prices of energy and other commodities.",
        "The same member argued that a necessary condition for an economy to keep inflation low in a continuous and sustained manner is through constant gains in productivity.",
        "As for the downside risks, some members highlighted that the ratification of the trade agreement with the United States and Canada could have favorable consequences on both markets and exchange rate.",
        "The majority of the members noted that since the last monetary policy decision, the Mexican peso has exhibited more resilience than the currencies of other emerging economies, attributing this situation to both the progress in the trade negotiations with the United States and Canada, and the country’s prudent macroeconomic management, highlighting the monetary policy stance adopted by Banco de México.",
        "In this sense, one member emphasized that the monetary policy stance that has been implemented has allowed interest rate differentials between Mexico and the United States to remain high, a fact that is one of the main reasons that explain the relatively good performance of the prices of Mexican assets.",
        "Another added to the above factors the end of the electoral process in Mexico.",
        "As for interest rates, one member indicated that shortterm rates registered slight changes, while increases in medium- and long-term rates were observed.",
        "Another member commented that, in general, the country’s yield curve has remained relatively flat, making it clear that monetary policy has been effective in containing inflation expectations and the term premia.",
        "One member pointed out that, although there were outflows by foreign investors of fixed income instruments, mainly medium and long term, sovereign risk indicators did not show significant adjustments and that they remain at levels consistent with the country’s risk profile.",
        "The majority of the members agreed that domestic financial markets and Mexico’s exchange rate, in particular, could be affected by the aforementioned external and domestic risks.",
        "In this context, the majority of the members highlighted the importance of having solid macroeconomic fundamentals, which have allowed the economy to adjust in an orderly manner to a particularly complex environment.",
        "One member argued that maintaining solid macroeconomic fundamentals is necessary to preserve favorable conditions for economic activity and to avoid vulnerabilities, which, in the event of risk materialization, could lead to a rebalancing of asset portfolios and to capital outflows.",
        "Another member stated that prudent monetary policy actions are essential to reach and maintain macroeconomic stability.",
        "The same member stated that, nevertheless, in the absence of an adequate support from fiscal policy, these actions would have higher costs for the economy and they might even be insufficient.",
        "For this reason, the member emphasized the importance, beyond a solid fiscal position in the country’s public finances face in the medium and long runs.",
        "Such member stated that, in that member’s opinion, the most relevant matter for the monetary and fiscal authorities at this stage is to evaluate how to safeguard what has already been achieved and how to address the pending issues in a timely manner.",
        "In this sense, one of the members warned that public finances display a high level of vulnerability, pointing out that in the years previous to 2017 public indebtedness had increased considerably.",
        "In particular, this member mentioned that, from 2007 to 2016, the Historical Balance of Public Sector’s Financial Requirements (SHRFSP, for its acronym in Spanish) went from 28.8 to 48.7% of GDP, and from 2013 to 2016, from 37.2 to 48.7% of GDP.",
        "That member added that, despite the reduction of the SHRFSP in 2017, it is difficult for this decline to be sustainable, since it was based, to a large extent, on cutbacks in public investment, which is currently at very low levels.",
        "The same member warned that, given the country’s fiscal situation, and taking into account the expected future increases in international interest rates, the conditions of access to financing can turn less favorable.",
        "Furthermore, such member argued that, in addition to the structural vulnerability of public finances, there is also uncertainty about the fiscal management of the incoming administration.",
        "Another member added that the president elect and his transition team have stated their commitment to preserve the health of public finances.",
        "However, the same member highlighted that it is necessary to know in detail the public policies of the new administration and their potential effects on productivity and on the country’s competitiveness.",
        "One member stated that financial markets discount that a solid fiscal position will be continued.",
        "Elaborating on the structural challenges that the economy faces, one member highlighted the lack of total factor productivity (TFP) growth over the past two decades and the weakness of investment.",
        "The same member pointed out that according to INEGI figures the last spike in the TFP was observed in Such member noted that from 2007 to 2012, this indicator decreased 0.8% each year, whereas from member attributed the above to various factors: a) a regulation and, more generally, rules of economic interaction, that allow excessive market power in some sectors – including several strategic ones— and the few incentives for innovation, research and development; b) a fiscal and social security system that generates large distortions in the labor market, spurring informality; and, c) the prevalence of corruption and insecurity which, together with the aforementioned factors, threatens the rule of law and, particularly property rights.",
        "The same member considered that given such factors, the slower dynamism of investment over several years should not be surprising.",
        "Such member expressed concerns about some of the public policy proposals that have been discussed recently, and about their possible effect over the economy’s development in the long run.",
        "First, such member reflected upon different commentator’s opinions regarding the objectives that a central bank ought to have.",
        "Such member emphasized that monetary policy cannot influence the potential growth of an economy, and that, at best, it can only affect the cyclical component of aggregate demand in order to guide inflation towards a particular target.",
        "In this sense, such member stated that assuming there is a trade-off between growth and inflation which can be harnessed systematically by a central bank, in the short and long run, implies returning to past discussions and debates that have been solved in both academic and practical terms.",
        "Such member noted that this argument is based on fifty years of economic analysis, at an international level, as well as on the historical experience of Mexico and many other countries in the last decades.",
        "Second, such member indicated that the proposals about using the international reserves to finance public spending, for example in investment or any other type of expenditure, do not take into account the fact that international reserves are not a source of net wealth, since these have to be financed with the issuance of liabilities by the central bank.",
        "The same member emphasized that the implementation of such proposals would directly jeopardize the central bank’s independence and its main statutory mandate, leading to a situation of fiscal dominance over monetary policy.",
        "The same member argued that, in the best case, implementing some of these measures would generate a greater inflationary bias, besides the one the Mexican economy already has, and, in the worst case, it would be a return to policies that have already been tried and have failed, and that would imply returning to times of recurring financial and balance of payments crises.",
        "Regarding the factors to be taken into consideration for the monetary policy decision, the majority of the members highlighted that core inflation –the component that responds more clearly to the monetary policy stance– has evolved, in general, as anticipated, and is expected to continue to decrease, although some of them pointed out that at a lower rate and subject to greater risks.",
        "In this regard, one member emphasized that such component has exhibited a significant degree of persistence.",
        "In this context, the majority acknowledged that monetary policy faces challenges and that it must avoid that the supply shocks that have affected non-core inflation contaminate the economy’s price formation process.",
        "One member mentioned that the latter is important since these shocks can continue for a considerable period, significantly increasing the risk of secondround effects.",
        "The same member added that the latter risk is high in an environment where long term inflation expectations have persistently remained above the target, arguing that, in this context, the central bank's credibility could be affected, which would imply high costs for the Institution and the economy.",
        "Another member said that the current conditions make the monetary policy decision complex since, as mentioned before, inflation is still high and its speed of convergence has decreased, while its core component remains on a downward trend and domestic conditions have improved.",
        "The majority of the members reiterated that the lower uncertainty after the trade agreement reached in North America has contributed to the Mexican peso’s resilience.",
        "One member argued that the latter opens up some room for maneuver for monetary policy in Mexico in the face of the increases expected for the federal funds rate in the United States.",
        "Another member noted that while such trade agreement reduces an important source of uncertainty, it is unlikely to have enough impact on the exchange rate as to significantly increase the likelihood of inflation converging to its target during the forecast horizon.",
        "The same member specified that the current monetary policy stance, prudent and defensive –both domestic and relative to the United States– has contributed to the recent favorable evolution of the Mexican financial markets.",
        "The same member argued that the latter has taken place in an environment in which monetary policy’s risk-taking channel is operating intensively and, therefore, capital flows are very sensitive to rate differentials.",
        "In this regard, the same member stated that both the inflation differential between the two countries which is anticipated in the short term, and the reduction in the interest rate differential that markets expect, are factors of concern because of the deterioration that such differentials would entail for Mexico’s domestic and relative monetary policy stance.",
        "Some members pointed out that, in the current circumstances, the likelihood of additional adjustments in the monetary policy stance in the short term has increased.",
        "One of them warned that either if the persistence shown by core inflation continues, or if some of the anticipated risks materialize or if other risks arise, Banco de México would need to act in a decisive and forceful manner.",
        "Another member pointed out that, in the event of an adverse scenario in which the real exchange rate would need to adjust, it is important to prevent medium and long-term inflation expectations from being affected, and to avoid possible second-round effects on the economy’s price formation process.",
        "Elaborating on Mexico’s monetary policy, one member detailed that given the shocks that have affected inflation since 2017, the monetary policy stance has been adjusted in order to ensure that inflation converges to its target in a time frame consistent with the full operation of the monetary policy transmission mechanism.",
        "Some members stressed that Banco de México has been communicating about several changes in such horizon, currently deferring inflation’s convergence to the second quarter of 2020.",
        "One member expressed that such forecast is subject to a high degree of uncertainty.",
        "The same member considered that the language of the monetary policy statement should convey clearly such possibility and also that the outlook for inflation is complicated.",
        "Likewise, the same member expressed disagreement with the forecasts made by analysts and market participants, which suggest that Banco de México is about to conclude its restrictive cycle and that it is likely to start a loosening cycle in 2019.",
        "Finally, the majority of the members agreed that, given a complex environment in which external and domestic risks persist, the Governing Board should remain attentive to the evolution of the factors that could entail additional pressures on inflation and delay its convergence to the goal, in order to be able to react in a timely manner.",
        "To guide its monetary policy actions, Banco de México’s Governing Board follows closely the development of inflation vis-à-vis its anticipated trajectory, taking into account the monetary policy stance adopted and the time frame in which monetary policy operates, as well as available information on all inflation determinants and on medium- and long-term inflation expectations, including the balance of risks for such factors.",
        "Given the Mexican economy’s recent developments, that the shocks that have affected inflation recently are of a transitory nature, and that the expected trend for core inflation remains downward, Banco de México’s Governing Board has voted by majority to maintain the target for the overnight interbank interest rate unchanged at 7.75%.",
        "One member voted for increasing the rate by 25 basis points.",
        "The Governing Board will monitor the potential pass-through of the shocks that have affected non-core inflation as well as other factors that could affect the evolution of core inflation, which is particularly relevant in the present scenario, since this indicator is still above 3%.",
        "The central bank will take the necessary actions, specifically, maintaining or possibly strengthening the current monetary policy stance so that headline inflation converges to Banco de México’s target within monetary policy’s period of influence.",
        "Banco de México’s Governing Board will maintain a prudent monetary policy stance and will continue to follow closely the potential pass-through of exchange rate fluctuations to prices, the monetary policy stance relative to that of the U.S. under an adverse external environment, and the conditions of slack in the Mexican economy.",
        "In the presence and possible persistence of factors that, by their nature, involve risks to both inflation and inflation expectations, monetary policy will be adjusted in a timely and robust manner to achieve the convergence of inflation to its 3% target and to strengthen the anchoring of medium- and long-term inflation expectations so that they attain such target.",
        "Alejandro Díaz de León-Carrillo, Roberto Del CuetoLegaspi, Irene Espinosa-Cantellano and Javier Eduardo Guzmán-Calafell voted in favor of leaving the target rate unchanged at 7.75%.",
        "Manuel Ramos-Francia voted in favor of raising the target rate by 25 basis points to 8.00%.",
        "For some time, inflation has been subject to a complex environment characterized by both cyclical and structural factors.",
        "This situation is evident as shown by long-term inflation expectations, which have remained around 3.5 percent for several years, regardless of the stage of the business cycle the Mexican economy is undergoing.",
        "Although there are several reasons for this, all of them are potentially reflected in the lack of growth of total factor productivity over the last two decades.",
        "This condition makes it more difficult for the Mexican economy to absorb supply- or demand-related shocks with low inflation.",
        "Due to the aforementioned, core inflation currently shows a high degree of persistence.",
        "Such persistence, together with perspectives for non-core inflation, makes it unlikely for the current forecast for headline inflation to be attained.",
        "Recently, Banco de México has already adjusted on several occasions its estimates for the time frame in which headline inflation is expected to converge to its target.",
        "Considering the current inflation forecast targeting framework for monetary policy, as well as the factors that are affecting core inflation, in my opinion, not responding as a consequence of this environment could be very costly for the central bank’s credibility.",
        "This section summarizes the views exposed by the members of the Governing Board regarding the monetary policy decision.",
        "All members highlighted that, according to available data, the world economy increased its growth rate during the second quarter of 2018.",
        "Some members pointed out that this increase was the result of higher growth in advanced economies.",
        "One member noted that this was due to temporary factors that faded out and had affected the dynamism of some of these economies at the beginning of the year.",
        "Nevertheless, most members highlighted that economic growth among advanced economies has started to show signs of divergence, emphasizing that, in contrast with the United States, where a stronger upswing in economic activity is expected, the rest of the advanced economies have exhibited signs of lesser dynamism.",
        "Most members pointed out that the forecasts for world economic growth for 2018 and 2019 have remained practically unchanged.",
        "One member stated that growth rates are expected to be higher than those for 2017 and to be above potential.",
        "Notwithstanding the above, most members mentioned that both uncertainty in the short run, and medium run downside risks to world economic growth, have increased.",
        "Such members pointed to three risks that stand out: i) the intensification of protectionist trade measures; ii) a possible tightening of financial conditions caused by a faster pace of normalization of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve, in case of inflationary surprises in the United States; and, iii) the escalation of certain geopolitical risks.",
        "Some members added that the protectionist actions adopted by the United States have led to retaliatory trade measures by other countries, and that the possible escalation of these could have significant effects on global trade and investment.",
        "One member pointed out that these events could significantly reduce international trade flows, even in countries not directly involved.",
        "In this regard, the same member highlighted that, according to recent estimates, increases in tariff barriers to levels authorized by the WTO, could result in a reduction of world trade similar to that observed in 2008-2009, affecting to a larger extent emerging and developing regions.",
        "This member stated that this is particularly relevant in view of the importance of international flows of merchandises and services for world growth.",
        "In this regard, another member noted that growth figures for world trade volume already show a clear reversion.",
        "Regarding geopolitical risks, one member argued that such episodes could have a negative effect not only on economic activity of the regions involved, but also on the world economy, mainly through its effect on investment.",
        "This member also added that although the world’s geopolitical situation apparently has improved after the recent meeting between the Presidents of the United States and North Korea, tensions in other fronts persist and are at risk of intensifying.",
        "Additionally, this member stated that, on top of these challenges, there are those related to election processes and to political developments in different countries, both advanced and emerging.",
        "Another member added that world economic growth is forecasted to decrease in the medium term, in so far as slack conditions worldwide become tighter, investment and trade moderate, the effects of the U.S. tax reform fade out, the economic stimulus generated by China dissipates, and financing conditions grow tighter.",
        "As for world inflation, most members pointed out that there is also some divergence in the behavior of inflation and its expectations in advanced economies.",
        "The majority emphasized that inflation has increased in the United States, while some added that inflation remains at low levels in other advanced economies.",
        "As for the balance of risks to world inflation, one member pointed out that it remains relatively stable in the short-term, albeit with mixed signs.",
        "Some members mentioned that one of the main risks to world inflation is the intensification of trade tensions among some of the major world economies.",
        "One member added that other risk factors to inflation persist, including: i) a faster rate of increase of U.S. inflation; ii) a continuation of the upward trend in the prices of commodities; and, iii) problems in some emerging economies that have external or fiscal imbalances.",
        "Regarding economic activity, most members pointed out that the outlook for the U.S. economy has strengthened.",
        "Some members highlighted the upswing in U.S. growth during the second quarter of pointing out that these results are consistent with the increased levels of consumer confidence and disposable income.",
        "One member added that fixed investment has exhibited a strong recovery as well.",
        "Another member stated that the U.S. economy has undergone an atypical cycle, characterized by a gradual and widespread recovery, which has narrowed the output gap and led to historically low levels of unemployment.",
        "In this context, most members emphasized that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that slack conditions have tightened.",
        "Most members noted that U.S. economic activity is expected to grow at a strong pace in 2018 and 2019, and one member stated that the environment is more uncertain for the medium and long terms.",
        "As for other advanced economies, most members noted that in contrast with the United States, the Eurozone has grown at a slower pace during the second quarter of the year, and doubts persist as to the soundness of its recovery.",
        "One member mentioned that this has occurred in an environment where political tension in Italy and Spain has intensified and concerns about the possibility of additional protectionist measures have increased.",
        "Regarding Japan, another member mentioned that expectations for the Japanese economy's growth this year have been revised slightly downwards.",
        "As to inflation in the major advanced economies, most members pointed out that in the case of the United States inflation and inflation expectations have already started to increase.",
        "These members argued that the fiscal stimulus adopted, in the context of reduced slack in the economy, particularly in the labor market, might lead to greater pressures on wages and prices.",
        "One member added that the possible impact of protectionist measures and the recovery of the prices of fuels and other commodities could also contribute to an uptick in inflation.",
        "In this regard, one member pointed out that financial markets suggest that the balance of risks to inflation is somewhat biased upwards.",
        "In this regard, all members emphasized that there is a risk that inflationary surprises may arise in the United States.",
        "Another member stated that inflation has not only increased in the United States, but also in Canada, in contrast with that of Japan and the Eurozone, where it remains weak and below their central banks’ targets.",
        "Most members stated that, given the divergence in the behavior of both economic activity and inflation among the major advanced economies, the observed and expected trajectories of monetary policy have also exhibited some divergence.",
        "One member pointed out that, in view of expectations of a generalized increase in inflation, monetary policy in some advanced economies is foreseen to turn less accommodative.",
        "Nevertheless, the same member noted that this process will be faster in the United States than in other countries.",
        "Elaborating on the case of the United States, most members pointed out that, as expected, in its June decision, the Federal Reserve raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, to between 1.75 and 2.00%.",
        "One member stated that the language in its FOMC statement points to a faster process of monetary policy normalization.",
        "Most members highlighted that this committee increased its median forecasts for the expected trajectory of the federal funds rate for the end of 2018 and for 2019, and thus is expecting two additional increases of 25 basis points each for the rest of the year.",
        "One member noted that the forecast for the reference rate for the end of 2019 is already above the Federal Reserve’s long-run estimate.",
        "The same member emphasized that the Federal Reserve raised its projections for economic growth for 2018, for inflation for 2018 and 2019, and lowered those for unemployment for 2018, 2019, and 2020.",
        "Some members emphasized that the Federal Reserve reiterated its expectation that inflation will be near its symmetric 2% target in the medium term.",
        "In this context, most members concluded that the expected path is consistent with a scenario of gradual adjustments in the federal funds rate.",
        "One member pointed out that the scenario of higher inflation in the U.S. is being adjusted by the Federal Reserve with no distress, and that the baseline scenario for inflation in that country does not consider adverse inflationary shocks.",
        "However, all members highlighted that, given the possibility of inflationary surprises, the risk that the Federal Reserve may follow a faster-than-expected normalization of its monetary policy persists.",
        "One member mentioned that there is a higher probability of this event given the increase of both inflation and inflation expectations.",
        "The same member also pointed out that said normalization process is not expected to be accompanied by excessive volatility.",
        "Regarding the monetary policy of other advanced economies, one member pointed out that, given the moderate growth of inflation in the Eurozone, the European Central Bank kept its reference rate unchanged, stating that it is expecting to keep it at the current level until at least the summer of 2019 or until necessary.",
        "Another member stated that in view of these messages, markets incorporated a delay in the expected date for increases in the Eurozone reference rates until the fall of 2019.",
        "One member highlighted that the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan also kept their reference rates unchanged.",
        "Nevertheless, the same member pointed out that the Bank of England is expected to tighten its stance later this year, while the Bank of Japan is expected to continue with a highly accommodative stance possibly until 2020.",
        "In this context, one member estimated that, in general terms, the U.S. dollar is expected to follow an appreciation trend in the following quarters and that the spreads in both the levels and expected trajectories of interest rates between the United States and other advanced economies will be higher and probably more volatile.",
        "As to emerging economies, one member stated that these continue to grow at a fast pace, although exhibiting downside risks.",
        "The same member highlighted that the Chinese economy is gradually slowing down due to its position in the business cycle.",
        "However, this member stated that the slowdown could be greater as a result of the elimination of tax benefits and the escalation of a possible trade war.",
        "This member also pointed out that the scenario for inflation among emerging economies is also heterogeneous and that the recent depreciation of some currencies and the increase in the prices of commodities have heightened the risk of higher inflation in these economies.",
        "The same member pointed out that while some emerging countries have loosened their monetary policy stances, Argentina, Indonesia, Romania, and Turkey have adopted tighter monetary policy stances, due to their position in the business cycle and inflationary pressures.",
        "Most members highlighted that the world economic environment described above has led to greater volatility in international financial markets and to interest rate increases.",
        "In particular, one of the members pointed out that interest rates of U.S. 2year Treasury bonds have hit levels above 2.5% and also registered an increase of over 120 basis points since September, while 10- to 30-year Treasury bonds have yields of 2.9% and 3.0%, corresponding to increases of over 80 and 35 basis points, respectively, during the same period.",
        "In this context, most members noted that there has been a generalized strengthening of the dollar and greater risk aversion worldwide.",
        "Such members pointed out that all of the above has caused a reallocation of investment portfolios towards safer assets.",
        "In this regard, one member added that episodes of a strengthening of fixed-income assets have been observed in the United States, while another member added that concerns about overvalued assets persist, particularly those of emerging economies, as well as about the growing use of complex derivatives, which have contributed to further adjustments in financial markets.",
        "In this regard, most members noted that capital outflows have been observed, particularly of fixed income assets from emerging economies and, in some cases, this situation has been intensified by idiosyncratic factors.",
        "In this context, most members stated that the currencies of most emerging economies depreciated significantly and exhibited greater volatility.",
        "One of the members expressed that the adjustment in emerging markets has also been significant in equity instruments and even in sovereign risk indicators.",
        "In this regard, the same member pointed out that, in a context of lower search for yield, these countries will face tighter financial conditions.",
        "Another member argued that this scenario is expected to have adverse effects on the economic performance of these countries and, more markedly, on those economies where high levels of both public and private indebtedness, among other vulnerabilities, persist.",
        "All members stated that in the first quarter of 2018 economic activity in Mexico continued gaining strength, growing at a rate even higher than that observed in the previous quarter, although most members noted that some timely indicators suggest a slight slowdown during the second quarter.",
        "One member added that economic growth during the first quarter was apparently influenced by transitory factors, such the impact of the reconstruction efforts after the earthquakes of September 2017, which affected both industrial production and investment figures.",
        "The same member added that the recent strengthening of investment may also be the result of capital goods imports being brought forward due to the uncertainty related to the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and, in general, to the escalation of protectionist trends in the world.",
        "This member added that aggregate demand generally increases in the months prior to presidential elections.",
        "Most members highlighted that consumption and exports continued to increase, although exports exhibited a slight moderation in April.",
        "Some members stated that investment is apparently slowing down.",
        "On the supply side, most members noted that services continued growing strongly, while industrial production weakened due to an incipient adjustment in the trend of construction observed since April, as well as a slight lack of dynamism in manufacturing.",
        "One member added that this occurred after the upswing of investment in the previous months, mainly driven by the rebound in construction.",
        "Regarding low-frequency developments in economic activity, one member pointed out that in recent years the economy has been subject to a lower availability of external funds and to a high degree of uncertainty, which have led to a significant depreciation of the real exchange rate.",
        "The same member added that external demand has been adjusting in response to the significant change in relative prices and to an environment of higher real interest rates.",
        "The same member also added that this has led to the following trends in the adjustment process: i) a high dynamism in exports; ii) a slight moderation in consumption; and, iii) a tendency for weak investment.",
        "Most members noted that the forecasts for growth for this year and for 2019, published in Banco de México’s Quarterly Report, remain unchanged.",
        "One member noted that the Mexican economy is expected to slow down in the following months as the factors that influenced economic activity temporarily at the beginning of 2018 fade out.",
        "This and another member added that the aforementioned slowdown will also be influenced by a slower rate of growth of spending in the second semester; a relatively slight negative effect of the recent imposition of tariffs on imports from Mexico by the United States and Mexico’s response; and, an additional reduction in the oil production platform.",
        "Given the uncertainty caused by the complex environment faced by the Mexican economy, most members considered that the balance of risks to growth continues to be biased downwards.",
        "Some members estimated that this balance has deteriorated and one member pointed out that, although risk factors in general terms are the same that have been observed since some months ago, several of them indicate a more challenging outlook.",
        "Among such risk factors, most members pointed out the aforementioned global risks, as well as uncertainty associated to the lack of agreement in the NAFTA negotiations and to the country’s electoral and post-electoral processes.",
        "As to the last two factors, some members noted the possibility that they may lead to the postponement of investment projects or to the reduction of consumer spending.",
        "Most members pointed out the possible consequences on economic activity of an environment of uncertainty related to the electoral process, to institutional weakness, as well as to crime and public insecurity.",
        "Regarding these two last phenomena, one of the members stated that they constitute challenges to the monopoly of the use of force by the State and have intensified lately, even in Mexico City, which may suggest that such phenomena are no longer geographically isolated.",
        "Another member argued that the growing public insecurity has already affected the country’s productive activity.",
        "The same member mentioned as an additional risk factor the possibility of future adjustments in the fiscal stance that may deteriorate the perception of sovereign risk.",
        "Some members added the possibility of volatility episodes in financial markets.",
        "One member also mentioned the worsening of volatility in domestic financial markets, especially in the foreign exchange market, while another member referred to the implications of the recent U.S. fiscal reform.",
        "Most members highlighted that the recent performance of economic activity caused a slight tightening in slack conditions.",
        "One of the members pointed out that this tightening has been observed mainly in the labor market.",
        "The same member added that some wage indicators have started to increase.",
        "These indicators, the member also pointed out, should be monitored in order to thoroughly identify their role in the price formation process.",
        "Moreover, another member considered that the labor market situation exhibits no significant changes.",
        "The same member noted that, in April, the domestic unemployment rate posted figures similar to those observed since mid-2017.",
        "This member stated that, indeed, this market continues to exhibit tight conditions, which are consistent with an output gap close to zero, as suggested by most available indicators.",
        "This member added that the deterioration of real wages observed during 2017 apparently has ended, although no excessive wage pressures are observed.",
        "Some members pointed out that growth is expected to run close to potential for the rest of 2018 and for 2019, thus maintaining the output gap close to zero.",
        "One of the members mentioned that this would imply that, starting from a level moderately above zero, the output gap will gradually converge to zero in the following quarters.",
        "The same member added that this is reflected in both the recent and expected development of a broad set of cyclical indicators of the economy as well as in the output gap excluding the oil sector, which, from this member’s standpoint, is the correct way to evaluate the economy’s current position in the business cycle.",
        "All members agreed that annual headline inflation continued to decrease, from 4.55% in April to 4.51% in May.",
        "Some members pointed out that in May headline inflation moderated the rate at which it had been falling since January.",
        "Most members noted that core inflation fell from 3.71% in April to 3.69% in May.",
        "Some members attributed this behavior partly to the monetary policy actions implemented recently and to the fading out of the shocks that affected it last year.",
        "Moreover, some members pointed out that this decrease occurred despite the increases in the prices of services caused by a calendar effect.",
        "One member added that this situation contrasts with the decline in the prices of merchandises.",
        "As for noncore inflation, most members noted that this component also fell, from 7.07 to 6.99% during the same period.",
        "One member stated that this was due to reductions in the prices of agricultural products.",
        "However, most members pointed out that these price reductions were partially offset by increases in the prices of gasolines and L.P. gas.",
        "Most members stated that between April and May surveys remained relatively stable for all terms.",
        "Some members specified that those for the end of respectively.",
        "One of the members added that expectations for the following twelve months decreased from 4.01 to 3.90%.",
        "Regarding headline inflation expectations, another member stated that short-term expectations increased slightly and that they are above Banco de México’s forecasts.",
        "In regards to core inflation expectations, the same member pointed out that those for the end of 2018 and 2019 remained at the same levels of 3.54 and expectations, most members stated that they remain stable at a level of 3.5%.",
        "Some members emphasized that, in this context, expectations are above Banco de México’s forecasts and the 3% target.",
        "Regarding the spreads between nominal and real yields of government securities that correspond to a compensation for inflation and for inflation risk premia, most members pointed out that these spreads have increased.",
        "One of the members stated that this suggests greater concern of markets regarding the behavior of medium- and long-term inflation.",
        "In this regard, another member noted that the inflation risk premia has been increasing at the margin, while another member highlighted that inflation expectations drawn from market instruments have remained practically unchanged.",
        "Some members agreed that the decline in inflation during the first five months of 2018 is consistent with its convergence to the target as forecasted by Banco de México in its latest Quarterly Report.",
        "Nevertheless, the majority expressed that some of the upside risks to inflation identified by the Central Bank have started to materialize.",
        "It stated that, in particular, the peso exchange rate has depreciated even further, while the prices of gasoline and L.P. gas have been under pressure, in line with increases in their international references.",
        "One member pointed out that the outlook of prolonged NAFTA negotiations could imply a level of the exchange rate above that expected for the rest of the year.",
        "Most members noted the effect that the tariffs imposed on some products and inputs from the United States could also have, although it is estimated that their impact on inflation would be limited and short-lived.",
        "Nevertheless, one member stated that such impact could be greater as more products subject to tariffrelated measures are added to the list.",
        "Regarding the nature of these events, one member pointed out that, in some cases, they consist of changes in relative prices that have a short term effect on inflation, while in other cases, such as the depreciation of the peso, the inflationary impact could be more long-lived.",
        "One member recalled that the inflation forecast included in the latest Quarterly Report was prepared expecting an orderly behavior of the exchange rate, a significant reduction of noncore inflation, and the absence of cyclical pressures on inflation.",
        "All members considered that if the aforementioned pressures on inflation persist, these will affect the rate at which inflation declines.",
        "Taking the above into account, most members highlighted that the risk to inflation converging to its target at a slower rate than previously expected has increased.",
        "Some members pointed out that inflation may not attain the 3% target during 2019.",
        "Most members agreed that the balance of risks to the forecasted trajectory of inflation has worsened since the last monetary policy decision and remains biased to the upside, in an environment of high uncertainty.",
        "Among the main upward risks to inflation are that the peso exchange rate continues to be under pressure due to an environment of higher external interest rates and U.S. dollar strength, and to uncertainty associated with both the NAFTA renegotiation and this year´s electoral process.",
        "Some members mentioned that the uncertainty associated with the post-electoral process could also affect the exchange rate.",
        "One member added that there is the risk that the exchange rate depreciation becomes permanent and that the exchange rate continues being subject to depreciation pressures.",
        "The same member also mentioned that this would imply risks in at least two aspects: i) that the passthrough of exchange rate fluctuations to consumer prices also becomes permanent; and, ii) that the passthrough per unit of depreciation increases.",
        "In the same direction, this member was concerned that the passthrough to the prices of services may become positive, when it is currently close to zero.",
        "Another member pointed out that increases in the prices of the non-core component basket cannot be ruled out, due to their high volatility.",
        "In this regard, some members highlighted that the risk of continuous upward pressures in the prices of certain energyrelated goods or shocks to agricultural prices persists.",
        "Some members mentioned the risk of changes to the gasoline price-smoothing policy, while one member specified that this could generate greater volatility and lead to a change in the seasonality of inflation.",
        "Most members mentioned that, considering the current position of the economy in the business cycle, demand-related pressures could arise, particularly through the behavior of unit labor costs.",
        "In this regard, one member mentioned that lower potential growth could lead to greater inflationary pressures, even in a scenario where aggregate demand would grow at a relatively low rate.",
        "This member also stated that lower potential growth could also reduce producers’ margin to absorb any supply-related shocks.",
        "The same member mentioned that private sector analysts forecasts of inflation, and Banco de México’s own forecasts of inflation, do not consider the possibility of a significant increase in the minimum wage.",
        "The same member mentioned that if said increases do not reflect labor productivity gains, it could significantly affect the economy’s price determination process.",
        "In addition, this member pointed out that the high structural vulnerability of public finances in Mexico is also a risk for inflation, and the same member also stated as a risk the fact that long-term inflation expectations are around persistence and hysteresis.",
        "The same member also stated that the latter situation is reflected in excessive long-term interest rates, which implies significant costs for the population.",
        "Finally, most members pointed out that given the U.S. foreign trade policy actions, the risk of inflationary pressures generated by the escalation of protectionist and countervailing measures has increased.",
        "As for downside risks to inflation, some members highlighted a possible appreciation of the Mexican peso if NAFTA negotiations turn out to be favorable.",
        "The majority of members stated that since the last monetary policy decision, the Mexican peso depreciated further and its volatility rose.",
        "One member noted that the peso was one of the currencies of emerging economies that exhibited a greater depreciation, while another member pointed out that, in the margin, the peso appreciated slightly.",
        "Most members agreed that this behavior was influenced by the abovementioned external and domestic shocks and risks.",
        "One member pointed out that the implied volatility in exchange rate options exhibited overall increases in all maturities and remains high as compared to the levels observed in other emerging economies’ currencies, particularly for expiration dates close to July 1, when elections in Mexico will take place.",
        "In this context, most members stated that operating conditions in the foreign exchange market deteriorated, although one member considered that they remain at adequate levels.",
        "Most members mentioned that there was a reduction in derivative positions betting on an appreciation of the Mexican peso.",
        "Some members clarified that the latter was mainly observed among foreign investors with a short-term investment horizon.",
        "Regarding interest rates, most members expressed that these have increased, especially those for shorter terms.",
        "In this regard, one member mentioned that the yield curve has flattened considerably.",
        "Some members noted that the longterm interest rate spread between Mexico and the U.S. has recently widened.",
        "Looking forward, most members agreed that in the next months, domestic financial markets, and the peso exchange rate in particular, will continue to be affected by a complex international environment.",
        "One member pointed out that although analysts expect the exchange rate to appreciate considerably after having depreciated markedly, there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding such expectation.",
        "The same member mentioned that the prices of Mexican assets are apparently incorporating with some probability the materialization of a new shock on the real exchange rate.",
        "Another member stated that, at first, pressures on domestic financial markets might diminish or increase depending on the economic message of the presidential election’s winner and, later on, depending on how this message is translated into concrete decisions when the incoming administration takes office.",
        "The same member mentioned that during this process it will be crucial to have in mind both the risks generated by a very complex external environment and by an economy with a high degree of openness to foreign capital flows like Mexico’s.",
        "Regarding macroeconomic policy, some members pointed out that the shocks that have affected the Mexican economy have exerted pressure on both the real exchange rate and real interest rates.",
        "In this context, most members emphasized that the monetary policy adopted to keep medium- and longterm expectations anchored, together with the attainment of the fiscal measures and the financial systems’ resilience, have contributed to place the economy in a better position to face adverse scenarios, like the abovementioned.",
        "In this regard, one member highlighted the importance of having a fiscal and monetary policy stance that contributes to generate the conditions for an orderly adjustment of the economy and of financial markets, and to continue working to consolidate the resilience of the domestic financial system.",
        "The same member added that such actions would reduce the probability of having to face portfolio reallocations and capital outflows.",
        "Another member mentioned that in an adverse environment like the one currently faced by the Mexican economy, the optimal macroeconomic response would be to adjust both fiscal and monetary policies.",
        "However, as mentioned by the same member, monetary policy would be the one that, to a great extent, would have to face the referred shocks and risks, given that, currently, for different reasons, a fiscal adjustment is very unlikely.",
        "The same member mentioned that public finances are subject to different sources of vulnerability and that these could be intensified in the near future given that the winner of the forthcoming elections, regardless of who it is, will try to fulfill his campaign promises, which could exert additional pressures on public finances.",
        "Another member emphasized that for Banco de México to be able to fulfill completely its constitutional mandate of ensuring price stability, it is imperative that responsible and sustainable fiscal policy be implemented.",
        "Some members emphasized the importance of fighting and reducing corruption and impunity and, in general terms, of improving the effective exercise of the rule of law.",
        "One member explained that institutional weakness is a burden for investment and growth, and that it affects both through different channels.",
        "The same member also added that this has already been reflected in total factor productivity remaining stagnant and even falling since several decades ago.",
        "Another member added that according to private sector analysts, among the most important factors that might jeopardize economic growth, as drawn from Banco de México’s surveys, are the increase in problems related with governance, such as political uncertainty, public insecurity, corruption, impunity, and lack of rule of law.",
        "As for monetary policy, all members pointed out that it is important to realize that some risks to inflation have already materialized and that the balance of risks to inflation worsened, which could affect inflation’s convergence to its 3% target.",
        "All members cautioned that monetary policy faces a more adverse scenario and with greater uncertainty.",
        "In this regard, one member specified that a distinction has to be made between risk, which is quantifiable, and uncertainty, which is not.",
        "The same member added that a robust monetary policy implies that a central bank averse to risk and uncertainty would need to act under a pessimistic scenario in terms of the variables it might consider uncertain, such as the behavior of the exchange rate.",
        "Another member stated that, given the current level of uncertainty, monetary policy can face surprises in one direction or another and that Banco de México must be prepared to respond in whichever scenario.",
        "Some members noted that, in an uncertain environment, the monetary policy stance is relevant for the adjustment in financial markets, including the exchange rate market, to take place in an orderly manner.",
        "In this regard, one of the members mentioned that, in case the Mexican economy faces a scenario in which the real exchange rate would need to be adjusted, it is important to prevent medium- and long-term inflation expectations from being affected and possible second-round effects on the economy’s price formation process.",
        "One of the members mentioned that a moderately-tight monetary policy has contained the decompression of the term premia and has led to a flattening of the yield curve, which confirms that this monetary policy stance has been adequate.",
        "However, the same member noted, the inflationary risk premia has increased and, because of this, monetary policy needs to be further adjusted.",
        "The same member added that the risk-taking channel of monetary policy has operated intensively and effectively in the last years.",
        "This member argued that this channel depends on the spread between U.S. and Mexico’s short-term interest rates, the evolution of which has contributed to improve the operating conditions in the foreign exchange market and has curbed the longterm interest rate spread, a spread that has recently increased.",
        "The same member noted that monetary policy must take into account that a narrowing of the short-term interest rate spread is not convenient.",
        "Most members highlighted the need to maintain a prudent monetary policy.",
        "One member pointed out that Banco de México has been communicating that it is convenient to act in such a way and considered that adjusting the central bank’s reference rate is consistent with such policy guidance.",
        "Another member added that it is necessary to act prudently and cautiously to raise confidence in the economy, mainly in a context in which several shocks are taking place simultaneously that might affect the economic environment and outlook.",
        "All members agreed that, under a more adverse scenario, a monetary policy response is essential to prevent inflation expectations from de-anchoring and other second-round effects from taking place, and to ensure the convergence of inflation to its target.",
        "Some members pointed out that this is particularly relevant given the economy’s current position in the business cycle and the absence of slack.",
        "One member mentioned that by adding elements to make monetary policy decisions more transparent and accountable, such as publishing the inflation forecasts, it is imperative for the central bank to explain and act in the event that those forecasts might not be met.",
        "The same member added that otherwise, the central bank would face a high reputational risk.",
        "Some members mentioned that in an environment as the one described above, additional increases in the next monetary policy meetings cannot be ruled out.",
        "One member added that Banco de México’s future forward guidance would need to be adjusted to reflect that further increases in the reference rate might be required.",
        "Finally, all members considered that the Governing Board must continue monitoring the development of inflation and its determinants, so that, if needed, monetary policy can act in a timely and decisive manner that allows the attainment of the central bank objectives.",
        "To guide its monetary policy actions, Banco de México’s Governing Board follows closely the development of inflation vis-a-vis its anticipated trajectory, taking into account the monetary policy stance adopted and the time frame in which monetary policy operates, as well as available information on all inflation determinants and on medium- and long-term inflation expectations, including the balance of risks to such factors.",
        "Given that some inflationary risks have started to materialize and the balance of risks to inflation has worsened and might affect the convergence of inflation to its target, Banco de México’s Governing Board has voted unanimously to raise the target for the overnight interbank interest rate to 7.75%.",
        "Looking ahead, the Governing Board will maintain a prudent monetary policy stance and will continue to follow closely the potential pass-through of exchange rate fluctuations to prices, the monetary policy stance relative to that of the U.S., and the conditions of slack in the Mexican economy.",
        "In the presence and possible persistence of factors that, by their nature, involve risks to both inflation and inflation expectations, monetary policy will be adjusted in a timely and robust manner to attain the convergence of inflation to its 3% target, and to firmly anchor medium- and long-term inflation expectations so that they attain such target.",
        "Members voting in favor of this decision: Alejandro Díaz de León Carrillo, Roberto Del Cueto Legaspi, Irene Espinosa Cantellano, Javier Eduardo Guzmán Calafell and Manuel Ramos Francia voted in favor of raising the target rate by 25 basis points to 7.75%.",
        "Most members coincided that during the third quarter of 2018 the world economy continued to grow, albeit at a more moderate pace.",
        "Some members pointed out that the world economy is expected to continue growing, although mentioning that such forecasts have been revised downwards.",
        "Some members stated that this situation is due to the materialization of several risks that have been mentioned on previous occasions and which still persist.",
        "In this regard, most members agreed that world economic growth is subject to a high level of uncertainty and to the following risks: i) the intensification of international trade disputes; i) a further tightening of financial conditions; and, iii) several political and geopolitical problems in some economies of systemic importance at the global and regional level.",
        "One member added the vulnerability of some emerging economies and oil price volatility as risk factors to world economic growth.",
        "As for the first aforementioned risk, one member referred to the adverse effects of world trade disputes, both those immediate and those in the medium and long terms, on world economic activity and trade.",
        "The same member stated that the probability that new tariffs between China and the United States come into effect at the onset of 2019 is still high.",
        "Another member emphasized the lower rate of growth of world trade, the fall in the Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Indexes (PMIs), and that in recent quarters such trade disputes have included regions and countries whose economic slowdown might have systemic implications.",
        "As for the second risk, the majority of members highlighted that a tightening of financial conditions is possible in case of a stronger-than-expected cycle of monetary policy tightening in the main advanced economies, particularly in the United States.",
        "The latter, in view of the possibility of an excessive tightening of the U.S. economy's slack conditions.",
        "Nevertheless, one member highlighted the contrary; that is, the possibility of the Federal Reserve increasing its interest rate at a slower rate, or to a lesser extent, given that inflation seems to be decelerating.",
        "As to the third risk, one member mentioned the Brexit negotiations, which although appear to be in their final stage after having reached preliminary agreements, they are still subject to new delays and setbacks.",
        "The same member also stated the existence of prevailing concerns about the situation of Italy's public finances and financing in the short and medium terms and the sanctions the European Union authorities may impose on that country.",
        "Finally, one member highlighted the complexity and fragility characterizing the current environment, both because of the unprecedented factors that are present in the global economy as well as because of the significant cyclical and structural risks the world economy is facing.",
        "Most members pointed out that the main advanced economies have continued to exhibit a divergent performance.",
        "Such members mentioned that in contrast to the economies of the Euro, Japan and United Kingdom, which have continued to grow below expectations, the economy of the United States continues to grow at high rates.",
        "In this regard, one member stated that both the mature cycle that the U.S. economy is undergoing as well as the procyclical fiscal policy implemented in that country were factors that contributed to the high growth rate during the third quarter of the year.",
        "Such member added that expectations of above-potential-growth rates for this year and 2019 prevail.",
        "One member pointed out that, as the effects of the fiscal stimulus have gradually dissipated, the U.S. economy may undergo a strong deceleration.",
        "As to the labor market in advanced economies, one member mentioned that the unemployment rate has continued to decline, reaching levels close to or below those registered prior to the crisis, while wages remained on an upward trend.",
        "As to the labor market in the U.S., some members pointed out that wage pressures have continued to intensify.",
        "One member emphasized that the unemployment rate has reached a historical low and that the outlook for wages and inflation has become highly uncertain, especially given the significant fiscal stimulus adopted.",
        "Nevertheless, one member stated that given the prevailing accommodative monetary policy stance and the fiscal stimulus implemented, what is surprising is that wages have not registered a greater dynamism, making reference as to how flat the Philipps curve currently is in that country.",
        "As for emerging economies, some members stated that growth in these countries weakened during the third quarter of the year.",
        "The majority of members warned about the vulnerabilities that persist in some of these economies.",
        "One member drew attention to the fact that, especially for these economies, international financial volatility is a factor of pressure for macroeconomic and financial stability.",
        "In the case of the Chinese economy, some members stated that, as a consequence of the trade tensions with the U.S., several policies have been adopted to revamp economic growth and continue an orderly rebalancing of this economy.",
        "Nevertheless, one member highlighted that, under the current conditions, the risk of these measures being insufficient or implemented too late has increased, which could lead to a greater-than-expected slowdown in this economy's rate of growth.",
        "Another member stated that forecasts for growth for Latin American economies have been revised downwards, in response to the tighter financing conditions the region is facing, to the slowdown of world trade, and to the presence of idiosyncratic factors that have deteriorated growth expectations.",
        "The majority of members warned that despite the evolution of international prices remaining relatively stable during the referred period, the balance of risks is biased to the upside.",
        "They also emphasized that in recent weeks a sharp reduction in energy prices was observed, as a result of the loosening of sanctions imposed by the U.S. on Iran, and to Saudi Arabia's difficulty to impose cuts on crude oil production.",
        "In this regard, one member added that if this situation continues, some of the pressures that have affected headline inflation worldwide could be mitigated.",
        "Some members pointed out that U.S inflation seems to be decelerating and remaining close to the Federal Reserve's target.",
        "However, one member noted that although no significant inflationary pressures are considered in the central bank's baseline scenario and, at the margin, such pressures have been smaller in response to the further strengthening of the U.S. dollar and the recent fall in energy prices, and despite the presence of structural factors supporting lower inflationary and wage pressures, such pressures cannot be ruled out.",
        "On the other hand, the same member also mentioned that in other advanced economies like Japan and the Eurozone, core inflation is still below their central bank's targets.",
        "Finally, another member stated that risks to inflation persist in emerging economies.",
        "Most members mentioned that, as expected, in November the Federal Reserve left the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged and reiterated its forecast of increasing it gradually.",
        "One member pointed out that the Fed's conduction of monetary policy has been supported by significant communication efforts.",
        "Another member added that monetary conditions in the U.S. are further tightening via two channels: raises in the reference rate and U.S. dollar appreciation.",
        "The same member stated that inflation in the U.S. appears to be slowing down and, in this context, markets are anticipating only three additional increases in the federal funds rate from this date to the end of 2019: one in December 2018 and two during 2019.",
        "Nevertheless, some members noted that the possibility of unexpected increases cannot be ruled out.",
        "One member explained that such risk may have diminished due to the results of the recent mid-term elections in that country, considering that the opposition's majority in the U.S. House of Representatives may hold up the adoption of additional fiscal stimulus measures.",
        "Another member stated that both the strengthening of the dollar and expectations of greater inflationary pressures in the U.S. than in other advanced economies, have contributed to the significant divergence in monetary policy stances among these group of countries.",
        "In this environment, most members noted that, in recent weeks, international financial markets underwent episodes of volatility, and the prices of emerging economies' assets posted negative results, differentiated according to each country's macroeconomic fundamentals and idiosyncratic factors.",
        "One member mentioned that such volatility further increased as a result of the sharp downward adjustment in crude oil prices and, to a lesser extent, to the reduction in other commodity prices.",
        "The same member added that a restructuring of investment portfolios towards lower risk assets has been reflected in capital outflows from emerging economies' fixed income markets and, in general, in the economies' exchange rates and other financial assets exhibiting negative results.",
        "Another member pointed out that the increase in the entire U.S. yield curve along with expectations of corporate profits having already reached their highest levels and the outlook of a downturn in sales, led to a significant adjustment in stock markets.",
        "The same member explained that U.S. interest rates increased markedly for all terms, reflecting not only the effects of the increase in the federal funds target range in September, but also the announcement by the Federal Reserve's Chairman that the interest rate increase could exceed its neutral level.",
        "In particular, such member stated that the spreads of long-term interest rates between the U.S. and the Eurozone had reached their highest levels in decades.",
        "The same member also warned about the evolution of international financial markets being subject to risks associated mainly with the process of monetary policy normalization in the U.S., which may lead to a disorderly adjustment in interest rates and, in turn, to capital flows readjustments with major adverse effects on emerging economies.",
        "From a longer-term perspective, one member pointed out that, in response to the financial crisis of 2008, the Federal Reserve has adopted a highly accommodative monetary policy stance for a long time.",
        "The same member stated that, apart from its effects on aggregate demand in the U.S., the monetary stimulus also contributed to a greater diversification of portfolios, with an increasing exposure to emerging economies and a higher leveraging of companies in these economies.",
        "Such member pointed out that, given the above and considering both the magnitude and long timeframe under which the monetary stimulus has been in place in addition to certain financial vulnerabilities, the Federal Reserve established a strategy of gradual and preannounced monetary policy normalization.",
        "The same member stated that, nevertheless, adopting a significant fiscal stimulus through both tax cuts and higher government spending since the end of 2017 has made the U.S. economy's performance more complex and uncertain.",
        "All Governing Board members highlighted that the latest information shows that the Mexican economy rebounded during the third quarter of 2018, after having contracted in the second quarter.",
        "As for aggregate demand, most members stated that the boost in economic activity has stemmed from the greater dynamism of manufacturing exports and from the upward trend followed by consumption.",
        "Nevertheless, the board warned about the persisting negative trend of investment.",
        "One member regarded such trend as one of the most worrying features of growth composition in Mexico.",
        "The same member mentioned that gross fixed investment has remained practically stagnant since the second half of 2015 and that, as a share of GDP, it currently exhibits levels that are around the lowest in the last 12 years.",
        "Such member argued that this represents one of the main factors behind the economy's modest potential growth rate, which such member estimates to be around 2.5% in annual terms, and which may be decreasing further due to the weakening of investment.",
        "As for production by sector of economic activity, most members stated that the growth of production resulted from the dynamism of the services sector.",
        "Some members added the improved performance of industrial activity vis-a-vis the previous quarter, highlighting the recovery of manufacturing.",
        "One of the members emphasized the continuing deterioration of mining, quarrying and oil and gas extraction, particularly the downward trend of oil and gas extraction.",
        "As to the forecasts for economic activity, one member stated that gross fixed investment is expected to fall once again during the quarter due to the negative performance of both construction and machinery and equipment of domestic origin.",
        "Another member added that consumption is anticipated to decelerate, while other members mentioned that public spending is expected to decrease.",
        "Some members pointed out that the forecast for Mexico's GDP growth for 2018 and 2019 remains within the ranges published in Banco de México's last Quarterly Report.",
        "Nevertheless, one member noted that the growth environment for 2019 is highly uncertain since there is no available information on the details of the economic package or the specific public policy strategies of the incoming administration for next year.",
        "Another member argued that both relevant international entities and private sector experts have revised downwards the growth forecasts for Mexico and some of whom have revised their estimate for 2019 to even below 2.0%.",
        "Most members pointed out that, from a cyclical perspective, the balance of risks for growth continues biased to the downside and has deteriorated at the margin, due mainly to both the complex external environment faced by the Mexican economy and the abovementioned domestic uncertainty factors.",
        "Some members added that this bias to the downside appears in both the short- and medium-term timeframe.",
        "One of the members noted that, although this bias may have decreased given the trade agreement reached between Mexico, Canada and the U.S., other elements of uncertainty persist.",
        "In addition to the abovementioned global risks, most members mentioned possible obstacles to the ratification of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), due mainly to the recent change in the U.S. Congress membership composition.",
        "In this regard, one member further elaborated that several leaders of the U.S. Democratic Party have declared their intention of modifying the USMCA.",
        "As an additional risk, most members pointed out the downward adjustment cycle of public spending that is generally observed during the transition process and the installment of a new administration.",
        "Some members also mentioned the risk of the persistence and intensification of the factors that have contributed to an environment of uncertainty and reduced confidence in the outlook for the Mexican economy as a result of the public policy actions the incoming administration may adopt or of the lack of clarity about such policy actions.",
        "Additionally, one member argued that there are significant medium-term risks, such as: i) the possible adoption of public policies that could affect the macroeconomic environment, the economy's price formation process, and the growth potential; ii) the greater uncertainty regarding the actions that will be adopted in the next years to increase Mexico's productivity and the adequate use of production factors; and, i) the public insecurity, corruption, impunity, and the absence of rule of law which affect negatively investment and economic growth forecasts.",
        "Most members estimated that slack conditions tightened slightly as compared to those of the previous quarter, although they remain less tight than those observed at the beginning of the year.",
        "Some members considered that the economy's cyclical position have not changed significantly since the previous monetary policy decision.",
        "Nevertheless, one member noted that perhaps the most relevant consideration is that such conditions have become less tight, at a slower and lower rate than expected, which has contributed to the persistence exhibited by core inflation.",
        "In this regard, one member pointed out that, although slack conditions remain neutral, except for the labor market, this situation has not been sufficient to make inflation resume its downward trajectory.",
        "Particularly, as to the output gap, one member stated that, given the recent evolution of economic activity, its estimates are currently around zero, regardless of whether oil production is included or not in such estimates.",
        "The same member noted that this conclusion is also supported by information drawn from a wide set of slack indicators across diverse economic sectors.",
        "On the other hand, in regards to labor market conditions, most members emphasized that these remain tight.",
        "One member pointed out that the unemployment rate measured by different indicators stabilized at low levels and also that the indicator with national coverage remains below the estimates of its long term level.",
        "Another member explained that wages have increased slightly, although one member considered that no excessive upward pressures on wages are observed so far.",
        "The same member also noted that.",
        "since the Mexican economy is expected to grow slightly below potential during the next two years, no demand-related pressures are anticipated.",
        "Nevertheless, the same member stated that labor market conditions must be monitored closely.",
        "Another member also emphasized the importance of evaluating the labor market conditions, their effects on the price formation process, and the policies that are to be adopted in this regard by the incoming administration.",
        "The same member highlighted that it is particularly important that wage negotiations are associated with productivity gains and do not imply a generalized cost pressure on the economy or affect the price formation process.",
        "One member insisted that, in his/her viewpoint, although assessing the stage of the business cycle that the economy is undergoing continues to be relevant, it has lost importance for monetary policy decisions, in the context of a significant increase in uncertainty and of role monetary policy must play in coping with such uncertainty.",
        "Most members stated that, in October, headline inflation registered 4.90%, reflecting the increments in energy prices that have prevailed since June, mainly those of gasoline and LP gas.",
        "One member underlined that annual headline inflation remains above the 3% target.",
        "Another member pointed out that headline inflation has begun to decrease but remains high and continues above Banco de México's forecasts.",
        "The same member specified that the recent decrease of headline inflation is explained by the behavior of non-core inflation.",
        "Most members agreed that the increasing energy prices -arising from the evolution of their international references and, in the case of gasoline, from a decrease in the fiscal stimulus applicable to their domestic prices-have contributed to the high levels of non-core inflation that have persisted for a long period.",
        "Nevertheless, the majority stated that it has begun to decrease.",
        "One member explained that non-core inflation decreased from 8.90 to 8.50% between the first half of September and the first half of October due once more to the variation in energy prices and the effect of a high base of comparison in the prices of these commodities.",
        "As for core inflation, most members considered that it has exhibited a high degree of resistance to decline, even increasing from 3.67% in September to 3.73% in October.",
        "The same members pointed out that the shocks on energy prices have also affected core inflation, due to the indirect effects that these shocks have had on the production costs of some core inflation components.",
        "One member underlined that core inflation has been further affected by the behavior of the peso exchange rate and has begun to exceed Banco de Mexico's forecasts.",
        "Some members noted that the rise in food merchandise prices further contributed to the increase in core inflation.",
        "Most members explained that, in addition to energy prices, the core component has been affected by the price increases of services other than education and housing.",
        "In this regard, one member pointed out that the component of services sector, which reflects the prices of non-tradable goods, has remained above the 3% target and exhibits an upward trend.",
        "Most members underlined that expectations for headline inflation for the end of 2018 drawn from surveys have been revised from 4.50% to 4.61% between September and October, while those for the end of 2019 continue at around the same level.",
        "Most members agreed that expectations for headline inflation for the medium and long terms remain around 3.50%.",
        "Nevertheless, one member highlighted that these remain above the target.",
        "Most members added that expectations for core inflation for the end of 2018 were also adjusted upwards, from 3.53 to 3.59% during the same months, while those for the end of 2019remained practically unchanged.",
        "On the other hand, the majority of members noted that the spreads between nominal and real yields on government securities suggest a considerable increase in inflationary risks in the medium- and long-terms.",
        "In this regard, one member pointed out that the compensation for inflation and inflationary risk implied in the spreads between nominal and real rates for different tenors has increased between 21 and 43 basis points.",
        "Another member mentioned that, since the last monetary policy decision, the spread for 30-year instruments picked up by 78 basis points.",
        "Such member stated that such spread is volatile and comprises.",
        "besides inflation expectations, several risk factors.",
        "Nevertheless, the same member mentioned that the higher spread reflects a significant increase in risk perception by markets, regarding the path to be followed by inflation in the medium and long terms.",
        "One member made clear that the increase in inflationary risk premia reflects the increase in the risks that affect inflation in the short, medium, and long run as, indeed, such risks affect inflation and its expectations since they emerge and up to the long run.",
        "Most members pointed out that inflation forecasts were revised upwards.",
        "Some members also mentioned that in the absence of an adjustment in monetary policy, the process of convergence of inflation to its target would be further delayed.",
        "These members noted that the upward revision of the forecasts is due to the higher-than-expected increases in both core and non-core inflation.",
        "Most members also highlighted that this revision includes a higher expected trajectory for both the exchange rate and energy prices.",
        "One member underlined that the higher-than-expected price increases observed in the different services other than education and housing, are tilting inflation projections upwards.",
        "All Governing Board members considered that the balance of risks to the expected trajectory of inflation has deteriorated and exhibits a significant upward bias, in an environment of high uncertainty.",
        "One member noted that some upward risks to inflation have materialized in recent months, in an adverse external environment with significant factors of domestic uncertainty.",
        "Another member mentioned that the balance of risks for inflation may be in the process of becoming even more adverse.",
        "The same member argued that some of the risks are of a cyclical nature, while others are structural.",
        "As to the main upward cyclical risks, most members highlighted that the peso exchange rate may continue to be subject to pressures stemming from external and domestic factors; a possible escalation of protectionist measures worldwide; the risk of additional pressures on energy prices or increases in the prices of agricultural products; that public finances deteriorate; and, that wage negotiations are not consistent with productivity gains.",
        "Another member underlined that wage pressures could arise due to the persisting tightness of labor market conditions.",
        "Regarding the shock to the peso exchange rate, the same member mentioned that, although both its persistence and final magnitude are still uncertain, the factors that triggered it suggest an adjustment in the equilibrium real exchange rate that will have an impact on prices.",
        "Finally, some members expressed their concern that, given the magnitude of the observed shocks and the level of inflation, there is also the risk of second-round effects affecting the price formation process insofar as new shocks continue to arise.",
        "As for factors of a more structural nature, most members agreed that inflation faces significant risks related to the possible adoption of policies that could affect the economy's price formation process.",
        "One member added that the adoption of such policies could also have an impact on the attainment of the inflation target within the expected timeframe.",
        "Another member stated that, in his/her opinion, currently there is no sense in assessing each of the balances of risks to growth and inflation independently because both are strongly intertwined.",
        "In this context, the same member highlighted that diverse risks have been present for several years.",
        "Nevertheless, the same member noted that, in the last months, three specific risks that may have considerable and deep adverse effects on inflation and, in general, on the economy's operating conditions are emerging at an increasing speed: i) an adverse shock to potential growth; i) a strong and fast deterioration in the conditions of access to international market financing; and, iii) the possible unanchoring of inflation expectations that may even lead to a situation of fiscal dominance.",
        "The same member stated that the above-mentioned risks interact and mutually reinforce each other.",
        "The member also listed the factors that he/she deems are affecting these risks to a greater extent: i) the uncertainty regarding the direction that economic policy will take in general in the next years; i) the management and structural vulnerability of public finances; iii) the possible indexation of wages to inflation; iv) the goals and guidelines on energy policy outlined so far; v) the possibility of implementing selected investment requirements for Retirement Funds Administrators (Afores) and their impact on public finances; vi) the uncertainty as to the effectiveness of the policies that will be implemented to fight the serious problems of corruption and insecurity; vi) the discussion regarding the impossibility of monetary policy affecting the economy's potential output; viii) the serious impact of using international reserves to finance public spending may have; and, ix) the possibility that the trade agreement between the three North American countries is reverted given the new membership composition of the U.S. House of Representatives.",
        "As for the indexation of wages to observed inflation, the same member explained that this type of policies give rise to a large inflationary inertia.",
        "The same member stated that there is wide evidence in the economic history of Mexico and of other countries, showing that the implementation of formal or informal indexation mechanisms on the economy propitiate the risk of losing control on inflation, affecting the target population that such mechanisms seek especially to protect.",
        "The same member concluded that besides the fact that the economy has shown for several years numerous characteristics that make the attainment of the 3% inflation target difficult -which is reflected in long-term inflation expectations being persistently around 3.5%- looking forward, the economy faces in his/her opinion, a major risk of de-anchoring of such expectations.",
        "Such member ended his/her intervention by expressing his/her concern about the materialization of such risks and how this would make the economy operate indefinitely with a higher inflationary bias and smaller growth.",
        "Some members said that after the presidential elections last July, there were clear signs of tranquility in the national financial markets.",
        "They mentioned that the transition team's speech, which emphasized the intention to maintain macroeconomic equilibria, as well as the announcement of the trade agreement reached in North America, contributed to such environment.",
        "However, most members considered that since the last monetary policy meeting such markets were subject to significant pressures due to both external and domestic factors.",
        "Among the external factors, the majority mentioned the high volatility registered in the international financial markets during recent weeks.",
        "In this respect, a member emphasized the widespread risk aversion feeling in such markets, as well as the observed strengthening of the U.S. dollar.",
        "Most members noted that within the internal factors that affected national financial markets are: i) the announcement regarding the cancellation of the New Mexico International Airport; i) concerns about Pemex' business model; iii) uncertainty associated with certain legislative projects, and, iv) the impact of several of these measures, as well as of some public spending projects and of uncertainty in financial markets, on public finances.",
        "Some members considered that internal factors were the main ones affecting the recent evolution of markets, emphasizing one of them that, instead of alleviating the greater tensions in the external environment, several of the actions considered or implemented had the opposite effect.",
        "The majority highlighted that, as a result of all the aforementioned factors, the exchange rate registered an important depreciation and an increase in its volatility, medium- and long-term interest rates in domestic and foreign currencies increased, and sovereign risk indicators deteriorated.",
        "Some members added that the stock market registered a significant fall.",
        "A member pointed out that, within emerging economies, Mexico presented the worst performance in the four mentioned indicators from October 17 to date.",
        "In this regard, another member expressed that the recent movements in the exchange rate reverted the appreciation that had been registered along the year, and that the Mexican peso stopped differentiating itself with respect to other emerging economies.",
        "Some members mentioned that despite the latter, trading conditions in the foreign exchange market remained stable during the period.",
        "With respect to interest rates, some highlighted that medium- and long-term ones reached their highest levels in the last 10 years.",
        "One of them added that recent increases in the yield curve are comparable to those observed after the US presidential election in 2016 and during the episode known as Taper Tantrum in 2013.",
        "Another member pointed out that, unlike in the foreign exchange market, there were significant effects in the fixed income market, emphasizing that interest rates moved abruptly under low liquidity conditions.",
        "With respect to the stock market, one member said that since the consultation regarding the possible cancellation of the New Mexico International Airport was announced, the Mexican stock market has accumulated a 10% fall.",
        "Likewise, such member noted that as a result of the legislative project about banking commissions, financial groups have presented the greatest adjustment within the stock market.",
        "Finally, regarding sovereign risk indicators, such member mentioned that CFE and Pemex bonds have also been affected, and concluded that local risk premia have increased significantly.",
        "The majority of the members argued that under the circumstances described, an environment of greater uncertainty for the country's macroeconomic framework has been generated.",
        "Some members emphasized that such environment entails important medium- and long-term risks that may affect the country's macroeconomic conditions, its growth capacity and the economy's price formation.",
        "The majority considered that investors' confidence on the domestic economy has deteriorated as a consequence of the abovementioned.",
        "One member noted that there is uncertainty regarding infrastructure projects, the rule of law, and the fulfillment of existing contractual commitments while another one highlighted doubts about the basis for decision making in the new administration.",
        "In this context, the majority of members stressed that rating agencies have expressed concern about the management of public finances and about the energy policy of the incoming administration, prompting some of them to change the sovereign debt's perspective from stable to negative.",
        "One member argued that the latter has impacted the country's competitive position since it could lead to reduced access to sources of financing.",
        "Moreover, some members mentioned that foreign investors have reduced their exposure to domestic assets.",
        "One member highlighted that while the Mexican financial system has enough capital and liquidity to face adverse shocks, the environment of external and domestic uncertainty, the increase in the cost of financing, and the prospect of weaker economic activity could pose significant challenges to the country's financial institutions.",
        "The majority of the members agreed that it is necessary to undertake public policy actions aimed at strengthening confidence on the domestic economy and providing certainty to investors.",
        "One member highlighted that, otherwise, the market deterioration observed during the last days could lead to a much more complex situation.",
        "The same member expressed that in an economy as open to external capital flows as the Mexican, the margin of error is extremely narrow, given that the markets' response is immediate and that the potential consequences can be considerable.",
        "Another member mentioned that maintaining appropriate public policies would contribute to avoid vulnerabilities that could lead to a restructuring of portfolios and capital outflows.",
        "The majority pointed out that among the aforementioned policies, it is necessary to maintain healthy public finances and establish policies oriented towards increasing the country's productivity, strengthening the rule of law, and fighting corruption, impunity, and public insecurity.",
        "The majority also indicated that it is essential to have an environment with clear rules of the game and solid institutions that encourage private investment.",
        "A member pointed out that, only in this way will it be possible to increase the potential growth rate of the economy, indicating that currently the maximum growth rates that are compatible with an environment of stability are modest and may even be declining.",
        "A member expressed that achieving healthy public finances is not only a matter of willingness, but also implies confronting the scarce margins that are available for its management.",
        "The same member mentioned that the unavoidable government expenditures must be considered, which include transfers to the states, pension payments, and the cost of public debt.",
        "In this respect, the member added that the recent deterioration of financial markets has resulted in an increase in the cost of financing for the government, reducing even more the scope of action.",
        "Such member also considered that if taxes in the border zone were reduced, it would undermine fiscal revenues, generating additional pressures on public finances.",
        "In addition, the same member stated that the details of the fiscal program to be approved will be crucial to reinforce the confidence in the Mexican public sector.",
        "Other member noted that additional concerns exist with regard to the financing of public expenditure and cautioned that if policies that may cause an additional deterioration of the public finances were implemented, this would generate an environment of slow growth and high inflation, and in such an environment monetary policy would lose its effectiveness.",
        "Regarding the factors that influenced the monetary policy decision, the majority of the members emphasized that the outlook of inflation has deteriorated significantly in both the short and medium terms.",
        "Concerning the more adverse environment that inflation faces on the short-term, the majority stated that core inflation has shown high resistance to diminish.",
        "The majority mentioned that, in addition to the above, there is the possibility of public policy actions that hamper the process of reduction of inflation, and also that there are new shocks arising from the depreciation of the peso, which will continue to be subject to pressures.",
        "Regarding the medium term outlook, the majority affirmed that the current environment of uncertainty presents risks for the nominal functioning of the economy and for its growth capacity.",
        "One member added that the depth and duration of the shock to national financial markets -including the exchange rate shock- is still uncertain, and that such shock interacts simultaneously with other adverse factors, such as the fall of the oil production platform and its consequences on the trade balance and public finances, the slow growth of the Mexican economy, as well as the uncertainty that still prevails over the formalization of the new trade agreement with the United States and Canada.",
        "The majority agreed that in case that this environment prevails, a period of weak economic growth and possible persistent inflationary pressures could occur.",
        "In this situation, monetary policy effectiveness is lower and its conduct is considerably more complicated.",
        "Most members noted that monetary policy should respond prudently in case that economic uncertainty increases significantly due to various reasons.",
        "In this regard, one member argued that monetary policy plays a fundamental role in managing such uncertainty, which possibly implies acting even more prudently than Banco de México has been doing up to now.",
        "In this context, such member pointed out that under the current conditions, cyclical considerations -on which central banks' decisions are usually based- have a lower weight.",
        "Such member added that structural factors have instilled a strong persistence on headline and core inflation, and that many of such factors are being reflected in the unfavorable evolution of total factor productivity.",
        "The same member highlighted that under the current economic conditions, the real exchange rate shows a strong pressure to depreciate, while medium- and long-term interest rates face upward pressures.",
        "Such member warned that the upward pressures on interest rates appear through two channels: an increase in inflation expectations and a rise in the term premium demanded by investors on Mexican financial assets.",
        "The same member indicated that the inflation risk premia increase as inflation expectations deteriorate, which would cause the economy to present a higher inflation bias.",
        "Such member concluded that an environment such as the one described should be accompanied by a tighter monetary policy stance by the central bank over time.",
        "In this context, all of the members agreed that it is essential to adjust the monetary policy stance in order to allow inflation to converge to the target during the forecast horizon, considering that in the current environment the possibility of headline inflation delaying its convergence to its target has increased.",
        "One member warned that achieving the inflation target seems complicated, even considering a decline in core inflation.",
        "All the members highlighted that the adjustment should be done in order to preserve the central bank's credibility and send a clear signal of its commitment to the attainment of the inflation objective.",
        "One member emphasized that adjusting monetary policy fundamental considering that under an inflation targeting regime the economy's anchor is the credibility in the inflation target itself, which depends on the confidence in the sustainability of public finances and on the conduct of prudent monetary policy.",
        "Such member pointed out that the significant adjustments in domestic markets, in magnitudes larger than those in other emerging economies, are a response to a shock whose depth and duration is still uncertain, which in his/her opinion the reference rate must be raised by 50 basis points in order to attain inflation's convergence during the forecast horizon, taking into account the risks that have materialized as well as the possibility that such risks deteriorate in the near future.",
        "Likewise, the same member considered that the current conditions justify a response from Banco de México equivalent to those implemented when facing similar financial tensions, such as those in 2016 and in the beginning of 2017.",
        "Such member underscored that, in a situation as the one described, the risk of a de-anchoring of inflation expectations exists and, thus, a forceful response from the central bank is needed.",
        "Another member concurred that monetary policy faces a complex environment characterized by an inflation rate above the central bank's forecasts, a persistently elevated core inflation, a significant exchange rate depreciation, an upward biased balance of risks to inflation that has deteriorated, and a greater risk of second-round effects, which would justify considering a 50 basis point adjustment to the monetary policy rate.",
        "Nonetheless, such member concluded that a 25 basis point increase is more convenient taking into account the decline that inflation is showing, that announcements on key decisions on fiscal and wage matters are still pending during the next weeks, that demand-side pressures on prices are not anticipated, and that the outlook of a rate of growth below potential with a balance of risks to the downside would contribute to mitigate inflationary pressures.",
        "Another member stated that, in his/her opinion, although it is convenient to modify the objective for the reference rate, currently a single 25 basis point increase is far from being sufficient to realign the expected trajectory of inflation to its target of 3% in general, not only within the forecast horizon.",
        "Finally, all members noted that Banco de México's communication should point out that the Mexican economy faces additional risks that could imply considerable challenges for the inflation reduction process, affecting the price determination process, and that, consequently, additional adjustments of the reference rate may be required, even in the short run according to one member.",
        "Another member emphasized that the Board must be prepared to observe higher interest rates along the yield curve.",
        "To guide its monetary policy actions, Banco de México's Governing Board follows closely the development of inflation vis-à-vis its anticipated trajectory, taking into account the monetary policy stance adopted and the time frame in which monetary policy operates, as well as available information on all inflation determinants and on medium- and long-term inflation expectations, including the balance of risks for such factors.",
        "Monetary policy must also respond prudently if for any reason the uncertainty faced by the Mexican economy increases considerably.",
        "In this context, and considering that the balance of risks for inflation is biased upwards and that it has deteriorated significantly, Banco de México's Governing Board has decided by majority to raise the target for the overnight interbank interest by 25 basis points to 8.00%.",
        "One member voted for increasing the rate by 50 basis points.",
        "Considering the challenges that have been faced to consolidate a low and stable inflation, as well as the risks that the economy's price formation process is subject to, the Governing Board will take the necessary actions, specifically, maintaining or possibly strengthening the current monetary policy stance, so that headline inflation converges to Banco de México's target within monetary policy's period of influence.",
        "Banco de México's Governing Board will maintain a prudent monetary policy stance and, under the current environment of uncertainty, will follow closely the potential pass-through of exchange rate fluctuations to prices, the monetary policy stance relative to that of the U.S. under an adverse external environment, and the conditions of slack in the Mexican economy.",
        "In the presence and possible persistence of factors that, by their nature, involve risks to both inflation and inflation expectations, monetary policy will be adjusted in a timely and robust manner to achieve the convergence of inflation to its 3% target and to strengthen the anchoring of medium- and long-term inflation expectations so that they attain such target."
