The Council judged that the current level of the NBP interest rates was conducive to meeting the NBP inflation target in the medium term
It was emphasised that further monetary policy easing by the ECB in the recent period was the result of extending and increasing the scale of asset purchases
These meeting participants also assessed that the acceleration of interest rate increases might not reduce inflation expectations of households, which are highly adaptive in nature
However, other Council members were of the opinion that wage rises for successive groups of public sector workers could be a risk factor for faster wage growth and potentially also for inflation
In effect, it was judged that the annual GDP growth in 2022 Q4 slowed down markedly for another consecutive quarter
The Council underscored that data incoming in 2023 Q3 signalled a further deterioration in economic conditions in the euro area, including in Germany
The Council members judged that the situation in the labour market remained favourable
In the opinion of these Council members, the currently observed strong fall in PPI inflation, the reduction in value of loans to the non-financial sector and the declining inflation expectations of consumers and enterprises would also contribute to a fall in CPI inflation
It was indicated that in 2022 inflation would be running at a substantially elevated level, which  in addition to the factors that had already boosted price growth  would result from the economic fallout of Russian military aggression against Ukraine
A further fall in construction output was also observed
It was also emphasized that price growth forecasts for the following quarters had been revised downwards in the recent period
The majority of the Council members judged that the marked decline in inflation and the lowering of inflation expectations were contributing to an increase in the restrictiveness of monetary policy
While discussing the outlook for economic growth, the majority of Council members emphasised that in the coming quarters GDP growth would most likely continue at a rate close to that observed in the first half of 2015
However, in the opinion of some Council members, Poland might benefit from the shifting of production closer to the destination countries, i.e
The Council members stipulated flexible supply of shale oil in the United States and some producers striving to retain their market shares as the likely factors behind the stabilisation of oil prices
Some Council members also assessed that stabilisation of the share of non-residents investment in the domestic treasury bill markets in October 2010 might be a sign of certain curbing of the inflow of capital to this market, which reduced the probability of strong appreciation of the zloty exchange rate
Other members of the Council emphasized, however, that some information from the labour market pointed to the wage pressure possibly rising in the subsequent quarters
Other Council members emphasised that the weakening of GDP growth in developed economies was consistent with the expected lower potential output growth in those economies following the financial crisis
Certain Council members judged that  particularly in view of the lower market expectations regarding interest rate developments in the major economies and the increase in oil prices in the past days  this might lower the anti-inflationary impact of the decline in inflationary pressure abroad on prices in Poland
The majority of the Council members judged that in light of available information stabilisation of the NBP interest rates was likely also in the following quarters
It was emphasised that higher price growth in the coming quarters would also be supported by stable GDP growth and further acceleration in wage growth
Certain Council members expressed concerns that rising risk in the environment of the Polish economy might prove a drag for economic growth in the coming quarters
According to these members, faster productivity growth could lead to higher wages in Poland provided that it was brought about by more innovation in the Polish economy
It was emphasised that the situation in the labour market further improved, and employment in enterprises  like the number of job vacancies  was relatively high
They also indicated that the rise in the prices of services might be connected with the increasing demand for services resulting from the adjustment of the consumption structure in Poland to the structure prevailing in wealthier EU countries
They also noted that the Fed had been indicating that it might not start to tighten its monetary policy soon, as inflation had fallen, there was no wage pressure in the economy and the US dollar had strengthened
It was observed that the negative impact of the pandemic on economic growth was mitigated by economic policy measures, including monetary easing by NBP
The Council members assessed that incoming data pointed to an improvement in sentiment and a revival in economic activity in the past few months, even though GDP would remain lower in 2020 Q3 than the year before
As a result, they judged that there was no cost pressure in the economy that would result from excessive wage growth
In this context, it was noted that corporate lending, including for investments, had rebounded
At the same time, it was noted, that uncertainty about the pace of economic recovery in Poland and its impact on inflationary pressures persisted
It was pointed out that a factor supporting consumer demand growth would be the further increase in household disposable income resulting from both growing employment and nominal wages and the launch of the Family 500 programme
In the United States, a marked acceleration in economic growth and declining unemployment rate partly due to a decrease in the number of economically active persons have prompted the Federal Reserve to start reducing the scale of quantitative easing
At the same time, it was pointed out that in the aftermath of Russian aggression against Ukraine, some factors will support activity growth in Poland
The majority of the Council members expressed the opinion that despite the progress of the vaccination process, subsequent waves of the pandemic in Poland could not be ruled out
Certain Council members highlighted the fact that the July projection signalled also higher food price growth in the subsequent quarters stemming from the lagged effects of the VAT rate increase and the higher agricultural commodity prices
The main topics raised at the meeting were the turbulences in international financial markets and their impact on the outlook for economic growth, the labour market situation in Poland and the public finance situation
This uncertainty results from the risk of a stronger deterioration in economic conditions in China and other emerging market economies, as well as the extent to which this weakening would translate into activity in the advanced economies
At the same time, it was assessed that subsequent quarters would see a downward trend in GDP growth which was suggested by macroeconomic data for April 2009 and economic indicators remaining at a low level despite a certain improvement in recent period
Certain Council members argued that the room for wage increases in the enterprise sector was limited, given that the rise in employment was accompanied by a relatively small pace of increase in production and hence labour productivity
Some members of the Council pointed at the persisting risk to GDP growth stemming from the developments in the external environment of the Polish economy, including concerns over the sustainability of economic recovery in the major developed economies associated with an elevated level of unemployment and reduction of high fiscal imbalances
These Council members underlined, in particular, that private consumption would most probably remain to be a factor supporting economic growth in the nearest quarters; yet amidst temporarily slow real income growth, consumption would be financed, to a greater degree, by decrease in savings rate
It was emphasised that a one-off increase of those prices would be pushing up the annual CPI level for the next twelve months
While assessing the prospects for inflation returning to the target, some members of the Council pointed out that by the end of 2011 inflation was likely to remain above the upper limit for deviations from the inflation target, as suggested by the short-term forecasts prepared at the NBP
Moreover, those members pointed out that withholding the decision to raise interest rates increased the risk of inflation remaining above the inflation target for a longer period which would subsequently require more pronounced curbing of economic growth necessary to bring inflation down to the target
At the same time, a further recovery in investment is forecast beginning from the second half of 2017
As a consequence, core inflation also rose, although it runs at moderate level
The Council members observed that, apart from the factors indicated, in some of the economies rising labour costs were also contributing to the surge in inflation
It was underlined that core inflation had also risen somewhat in the external environment of the Polish economy, including in the euro area
Some of them pointed to a rise in probability that the output gap might close earlier than previously expected given a likely acceleration in consumption growth
While discussing the domestic economic growth, it was pointed out that decline in industrial output and very low growth of construction and assembly production in May 2009 confirmed the subdued economic activity in Poland
They also pointed to the recent outflow of portfolio capital from Poland, related to lower relative attractiveness of investing in Polish Treasury bonds
In their view, unemployment  especially among young and low-skilled employees  is additionally raised by rising minimum wages in Poland, which exceeds average wage growth
As regards the conditions in the credit market, some Council members assessed that lending growth at the current rate does not, as for now, fuel inflationary pressures in the economy
At the same time, the growth of household deposits had picked up
The favourable outlook for exports performance is also related to the anticipated acceleration of growth in Polands main trading partner countries, as signalled by the upward revisions of their GDP growth forecasts
Yet, some Council members assessed that the risk of the second-round effects was limited due to slowing employment growth and heightened unemployment
On the other hand, the ECB was signalling further monetary policy easing due to the persistence of very low price growth in the euro area
It was pointed out that in the light of the draft amendment of the Budget Act for the Year 2009 passed by the lower chamber of the Parliament the drop in tax revenue in 2009 would be significantly deeper than the scale of the assumed increase in the central budget deficit
This was indicated by a decline in the share of firms planning pay rises and those experiencing mounting wage pressure
The protracted recession in the external environment of the Polish economy may delay the improvement in the domestic business activity relative to previous assessments
They pointed to the continuing moderate wage growth in enterprises, and argued that the risk of second round effects was reduced by increased level of unemployment, freezing of aggregate wages in the public finance sector in 2011 and limited role of trade unions in wage-setting in the Polish economy
The Council confirmed its assessment that, given the available information, the stabilisation of the nominal interest rates helped to keep the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintain macroeconomic balance
It was underlined that the sharp decline in global commodity prices, including oil prices, would be an additional significant factor causing a decline in price growth in the coming quarters
The majority of the Council members recognised that, taking into account the above conditions, and in particular the expected gradual decline in inflation, the weakening of the domestic economic conditions, including the fall in consumer demand, decline in inflation expectations, low growth in monetary aggregates, including low lending growth, and also the decline in inflationary pressure abroad combined with the risks to the global economic outlook, and taking into account the earlier strong monetary policy tightening, it was justified to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged
It was pointed out that the annual CPI index was 1.8 percentage points lower in August than in February 2020
Certain Council members highlighted that if wage growth did not pick up, the return of inflation to the target could lengthen
In this context, rising core inflation indices were highlighted, along with the increasing share of products and services, whose prices were rising at an accelerated pace
Some Council members were of the opinion that measures undertaken by major central banks should support revival of economic activity in Polands external environment, in particular, in the euro area, where improvement in consumer and investor confidence about the prospects for overcoming the crisis may be expected
Some Council members emphasised that several central banks eased monetary policy despite high inflation being observed in those countries
It was pointed out that high liquidity in the international financial markets at the moment facilitated the financing of the state budget deficit, and the public finance situation in Poland was hitherto more favourable than that observed in many European countries
With regard to the United States, interest rates are expected to be raised at the end of the year, whereas with regard to the euro area it had become common to expect interest rates to be kept at the current level
Certain Council members pointed out that the price growth observed by some households might be higher than CPI inflation calculated for the average household
Attention was also paid to GUS data on foreign trade deficit in 2007 which after revision proved higher than previously estimated, which was mainly connected with stronger import growth
Certain Council members remarked that in the coming months, rising food prices would probably have a boosting effect on inflation, with the scale of the increase remaining an uncertainty factor for price developments
Certain Council members judged that the stable economic growth and improving labour market situation would lead to a gradual closure of the output gap and the approach of the unemployment rate to the equilibrium rate NAWRU, which could lead to an increase in domestic demand pressure
A few Council members argued, however, that despite the economic recovery no significant increase in employment should be expected as during the slowdown enterprises strove to limit layoffs
In this context, those members pointed to the risk of slow economic growth persisting worldwide
It was indicated that in the longer term the level of oil prices would be determined by global economic conditions, technological change and the scale of investment geared to raising the output of this commodity
It was assessed at this point that global economic activity in the subsequent quarters would be hampered by  besides increased uncertainty  deteriorating labour market conditions, a decline in global trade and a rise in debt, which, while helping to alleviate the impact of the economic crisis at the moment, might drag on growth in the longer term
While analyzing the risk that heightened inflation persists those members of the Council pointed out that this risk was enhanced by the gradually increasing GDP growth which, in their opinion, was likely to exceed potential output growth in the subsequent quarters
Some Council members noted that the available forecasts pointed to a slightly slower rise in inflation in the coming months than envisaged in the March projection
Some Council members also pointed to rising business climate indicators, faster than a year ago credit growth and a further improvement in labour market conditions
It was noted that these data were lower than the market expectations
Taking into account the above-mentioned factors, it was indicated that the output gap would close within the monetary policy transmission horizon
These Council members were of the opinion that non-standard monetary policy measures could be a more effective instrument in counteracting the negative economic effects of the coronavirus epidemic at the moment
In this context, some Council members judged that the level of employment might be even higher than indicated by official statistics, which do not include a significant number of employees from Ukraine
At the same time, the growth rate of exports and imports declined
When discussing the economic situation in Poland, attention was drawn to the continuing stable economic growth in last several quarters
In October, retail sales as well as industrial output and construction and assembly production were higher than the year before
The majority of Council members assessed that despite the observed economic recovery, demand and cost pressures in the Polish economy remained low, which, amidst weakened economic conditions and falling inflation pressure abroad, supported lower domestic inflation
Those members also drew attention to the hikes observed in recent months in prices of certain goods imported from countries with low production costs and to the stabilisation of Chinas share of Polish imports
in countries being the most important markets for Polish exports
Weaker growth of producer prices was also pointed out
These Council members underlined that growth of non-food goods prices stayed very low, while core inflation was propelled by faster growth in services prices, partly driven by increases in certain administered charges, and partly by rising wages that reflected convergence of the Polish economy
When discussing inflation developments in the global economy, it was observed that despite favourable global economic conditions and the rise in oil prices, inflation abroad remained moderate
It was underlined that indicators of economic conditions in the manufacturing sector were also pessimistic
In the opinion of the Council members, the decline in inflation would be driven by both decreases in energy prices as of January 2013, negative output gap and lack of wage pressure in the economy
While addressing the June projections results concerning wages in the economy, some members of the Council pointed out that the relatively low wage growth in the subsequent quarters resulted from the assumption of incomplete adjustment of employment to the fall in demand during the economic slowdown the so-called labour hoarding
In April 2021, annual industrial output growth and retail sales growth had risen significantly
At the same time, they emphasized that if the incoming data failed to alter significantly the assessment of economic conditions and inflation developments, it would be justified to begin monetary policy adjustment at the following meeting
In addition, it was highlighted that the recent weaker data releases on the economic activity in the United States resulted in a setback in market expectations for the fed funds rate increase
The Council rejected the motion to raise the basic required reserve ratio from 2.0 to 3.5 and the motion to change the remuneration of the required reserves, from the level of the NBP reference rate to the level of the NBP deposit rate
Therefore, the Council decided that it would be justified to maintain interest rates at current levels at least until the end of the first half of 2014
Some Council members also judged that inflation next year might be elevated by the rise in some administered prices, including those in public transport, as well as price rises of goods with a high share of electricity in their production costs
While analyzing the situation in the euro area, some Council members pointed out that the situation in that economy is a bit better than before
While discussing monetary policy, it was pointed out that further interest rate lowering was expected in the United States and the United Kingdom and that, as anticipated by financial markets, interest rates in the euro area would most probably also be reduced in 2008
However, the extent of the easing was smaller than expected by the financial markets
It was also emphasised that without a clearly defined path of harmonising the rates of indirect taxes with the EU requirements and without a detailed liberalisation programme of the energy market, the assessment of future price growth path, particularly as regards administered prices, is problematic
When assessing the outlook for the Polish economy, the majority of Council members drew attention to the fact that consumption in the coming quarters might continue to run at a low level, curbed by the earlier and current increase in prices, including energy prices, high interest rates and the persistence of relatively weak sentiment
At the Council meeting, it was observed that the activity in global economy continued to recover, yet the economic conditions were under a negative impact of supply-side constraints in some markets, high commodity prices and re-escalation of the pandemic in certain countries
Some Council members emphasised that developments in the labour market, including the amount of labour supply, would also depend on changes in the tax and pension policy
Such a situation occurred in 2000, when stock exchange indices slumped, among others, due to decreased confidence in the reliability of companies financial reporting
Yet the majority of Council members assessed that no imbalances that might pose a threat to macroeconomic or financial stability were building up in the real estate market
The Council members judged that although some supply-side factors currently fuelling inflation would fade in 2022, the growth in commodity prices observed in recent months, including the prices of energy and agricultural commodities, might continue to boost price growth in the coming quarters
These Council members noted that the expected slowdown in GDP growth in the coming years, coupled with high competition in retail trade, would have a curbing effect on price growth
However, other Council members judged that total growth of loans to the non-financial sector was currently not excessive
Other Council members assessed that the recent decline in service price growth had probably been temporary
Alongside that, it was observed that increase in the minimum wage, as well as salary increases for public sector employees in 2024 would contribute to a higher wage growth in the economy
In their assessment, this could indicate that the growth in cost pressure might have levelled off
Weakening economic activity is also confirmed by the data on industrial production and leading industrial indicators, which in the recent months were significantly lower than a few months ago
Growth in external sales of goods, on the other hand, had probably halted
The Council decided to increase the NBP interest rates to the following levels reference rate to 4.75, lombard rate to 6.25, deposit rate to 3.25, rediscount rate to 5.00
Yet, few Council members assessed that the observed slowdown may be only temporary and its scale will depend, to a large extent, on the situation in the external environment, which according to most forecasts will improve in 2013
It was pointed out that in October price growth was once again lower than its forecast
It was also noted that the stabilisation of economic activity growth in China was a positive sign, which probably, to a large extent, resulted from the stimulus implemented by the countrys authorities
A motion was also submitted to lower the basic NBP interest rates by 0.25 percentage point
They assessed that inflation would be curbed by moderate economic growth
The majority of the Council members observed that the decline in the annual price growth in the subsequent months of 2023 would be supported by the base effect, as well as weaker upward pressure on prices driven by the fading of the previous supply shocks and the weakening in economic conditions, which, along with the decline in real wages, would constrain enterprises capacity to pass the rising costs on to product prices
This was indicated by moderate industrial output growth, slower retail sales growth and somewhat weaker  although still upbeat  household sentiment
The majority of the Council members indicated that growth in the euro area had most probably remained low at the beginning of the year, after sluggish GDP growth in 2018 Q4
Yet, it was also judged that adverse weather conditions could have had a temporarily negative impact on the US economic activity over recent months
At the same time, in the opinion of a few of these Council members, further monetary policy easing could, in the longer term, trigger a growth in imbalances in the Polish economy
Some Council members observed that besides changes in the trade policy of key economies, it was probably the tendency of slowdown in economic growth after years of expansion that negatively affected activity in many countries
At the same time, some Council members assessed that higher wage growth, amid the potential weakening of external demand, may have a stabilising effect on economic conditions and support inflation at levels close to the target
They also pointed out that worse than previously expected situation of the public finance sector might be another factor increasing the risk of zloty depreciation
At the same time, it was pointed out that prices were also boosted by the ongoing economic recovery, including increased demand stimulated by rising household incomes
It was estimated that the annual GDP growth rate would probably remain subdued also in 2016 Q4
In the opinion of some Council members, favourable foreign investor sentiment towards the Polish economy is supported by its strong fundamentals and the lack of macroeconomic imbalances
The majority of the Council members judged that a factor of uncertainty regarding the possible rise in inflation at the beginning of 2020 was the regulatory changes in the electricity market, which were difficult to predict
They drew attention to the fact that price growth was currently significantly elevated and that demand factors were also boosting prices
An opinion was also expressed that the reserve requirement system should not be modified until the decision not to calculate the reserve requirements on funds raised from domestic entities for at least a two-year period came into effect
While discussing business conditions in Polands external environment, Council members pointed out that global activity growth remained moderate and varied considerably across the regions
According to certain Council members, should data and forecasts incoming in the following quarters suggest stronger inflationary pressure than expected at the time of the meeting, it might be justified to consider an increase in the NBP interest rates
When discussing the current developments in Poland and their outlook, it was highlighted that a decline in industrial output and retail sales as well as a deeper decrease in construction and assembly pointed to more pronounced economic slowdown than previously anticipated
It was observed that amid weaker economic conditions and the forecast decline in inflation, an increasing number of central banks were putting monetary policy tightening on hold
It was also pointed out that the main factor behind increase in activity had been external demand growth, while domestic demand growth had stayed limited
In the case of economies exporting commodities, an important factor conducive to lower economic growth would be the decline in the value of their exports caused by falling commodity prices, whereas the decline in economic activity in the emerging economies which import commodities might additionally contribute to the lowering of prices of those commodities
Other members of the Council, however, argued that the lower activity in the United States could be a short-lived and small-scale phenomenon, among other things, due to the weakening of dollar exchange rate amidst rising openness of the US economy, still relatively high profitability of enterprises in this country and the considerable contribution of the service sector in GDP
Those Council members also noted that in the face of the fiscal imbalance it could not be ruled out that the VAT rate will be left unchanged at 23 in 2014
However, other Council members emphasised that the level of the real interest rates was not the main factor determining the savings rate and asset prices in the Polish economy
The majority of the Council members assessed that inflation would stabilise at a moderate level in the following quarters
Yet, some Council members were of the opinion that recovery in the Polish economy might be delayed, and the moment and scale of GDP growth acceleration were subject to uncertainty, especially given the uncertainty about recovery in the euro area
In turn, in the region of Central and Eastern Europe, central banks of the Czech Republic and Hungary had recently cut interest rates
It was emphasised that  according to Eurostat preliminary data  inflation in the euro area rose to around 10 in September, reaching almost 11 in Germany, over 17 in the Netherlands, and continued to clearly exceed 20 in the Baltic states
During the discussion about interest rates in Poland and abroad, some Council members pointed to the continuation of expansionary monetary policy by major central banks in developed countries
Few Council members noted that interest rate decreases would reduce the public debt servicing costs and therefore support the economic policy of the Government
At the same time, the Council assessed that recently uncertainty as to the scale and duration of the economic slowdown abroad and its impact on domestic economic activity had increased
In turn, industrial as well as construction and assembly output in May were lower than a year ago
In the opinion of those Council members, growth in the prices of energy commodities in the global markets and the effects of implementing the EU climate and energy package continue to be risk factors for a marked decrease in inflation
Certain Council members, on the other hand, assessed that inflation might prove higher than forecast, due to, among other things, the realisation of pent-up demand after the restrictions had been lifted
The Council members also pointed to a further slight fall in employment in the enterprise sector
Certain Council members were of the opinion that the persistently low core inflation in the environment of higher wage growth than in previous years resulted from the likely slower growth of the median wage, which might have a significant impact on inflation developments
In the assessment of some Council members, this could have reflected not only supply constraints, but also weaker growth in demand for labour
The scale of wage demands may be additionally enhanced by persistently heightened inflation
It was stressed that GDP growth was still driven by rising consumption, fuelled by increasing employment and wages, disbursement of benefits and very strong consumer sentiment
At the same time, it was pointed out that annual construction and assembly production growth was negative in January 2024
On the other hand, certain Council members expressed the view that an analysis of selected soft economic indicators suggested that the recession phase was ending and that the economy was entering the recovery phase
During the meeting, the Council pointed out that activity growth in the world economy remained relatively weak, although signals concerning a possible trade agreement between the United States and China had translated into some improvement of the sentiment in the global economy at the end of 2019
Those members pointed at the results of other forecasts conducted at the NBP according to which the forecast inflation, despite downward revision, would be running at an increased level in the coming quarters
At the same time, it was observed that there was still heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook in the coming quarters, and its source continued to be the further course of the pandemic and its impact on the economic situation in Poland and abroad
While discussing the impact of exchange rate on inflation, some members of the Council assessed that exchange rate developments remained the main risk factor for price stability
According to few Council members this could limit the risk of deflation in the euro area
The members of the Council also discussed labour market developments
In this context, it was noted that lending, particularly to households, had slowed down very substantially
It was emphasised that as a result, core inflation was also on the rise
With regard to inflationary developments, the Council members observed that in most economies inflation had continued to rise over recent months, reaching again the highest levels in decades in many countries
It was observed that situation in the labour market continued to improve as well, which was reflected in a fall in unemployment rate seasonally adjusted, a rise in employment and a marked increase in average wages in corporate sector in December
Forecasts signalled a further fall in global inflation in the coming quarters
It was underlined that domestic demand remained the main driver of economic growth
In the discussion about the consequences of zloty appreciation it was pointed out that it contributed to curbing inflation by decreasing imported inflation, including by easing the impact of oil price growth in the world markets on domestic prices
It was emphasised that the exchange rate appreciation tightened Polands monetary conditions and was conducive to easing the inflationary pressure, as the prices of imported goods denominated in zloty were falling
The risk of decline in capital adequacy ratios may  in the case of some banks  reduce their lending
It was pointed out that economic growth in the United States and in the euro area was also negatively affected by a decline in corporate loans and, in the longer term also by the deteriorating situation of the public finance sector
These Council members pointed out that this assessment was supported by the results of the March NBP projection indicating a limited risk of a lasting deviation of price growth from the inflation target
With regard to the decision on the NBP interest rates, the majority of Council members found that  given a likely persistence of factors fuelling inflation that are beyond the direct influence of domestic monetary policy  the limited scale of expected economic slowdown might not decrease inflationary pressure to a degree sufficient for inflation returning to the target in the medium term
On the other hand, the majority of economic sentiment indicators rose, which may indicate an improvement in the economic situation in the months to come
Against this background, a few Council members pointed out that even if standards for household lending were eased, this would not translate into any marked rebound in household lending due to declining household credit demand
While discussing the inflation outlook, the Council members pointed out that CPI inflation, including inflation net of food and energy prices, would probably rise somewhat in the coming period
Moreover, some members of the Council paid attention to the decision of the Ministry of Finance to exchange some of the European Union funds in the foreign exchange market
In the present situation they might prove to be relatively permanent and act asymmetrically, i.e
It was emphasised that the sharp slowdown in producer price inflation, which stood at 6.8 yy in April, while in the summer of 2022 was over 25, indicated a weakening of cost pressure
It was pointed out that in the case of an adjustment of electricity prices for households to market conditions, consumer price growth in 2020 Q1 might increase
In the opinion of few Council members, CPI growth in Poland might remain relatively low in the longer term, due to the persistent downward trend in commodity prices in the global markets
They also argued that, due to the difficult revenue situation of the general government sector, the coming period may bring further increases of administered prices, which would postpone the decline in inflation
It was also argued that the growth in prices of market services had already been following an upward trend for a longer period, and its one-off drop in mid-2007 resulted from the way in which price promotions were accounted for in the price index
Another factor contributing to higher GDP growth in 2016 Q2 was significant acceleration in exports
The opinion was expressed that despite that, higher wage growth in the entire economy could not be ruled out, particularly if wage growth in the public sector picked up
Other members of the Council underlined that since the beginning of 2008 the deposits of households had been increasing rapidly, which might suggest an increased propensity to save and be conducive to easing the demand pressure
However, the majority of the Council members judged that data from the enterprise sector might suggest a slight cooling down of labour demand in some sectors
However, some Council members underlined that in the recent period growth forecasts for the euro area had been lowered, which  should it continue  could indicate the risk of a stronger slowdown in Polands main trading partner
In this context, it was pointed out that in Poland the measures which could lower the inflationary pressure and consequently reduce the costs of bringing inflation down to the target were structural reforms, including the reform of public finances
Other Council members believed that GDP growth in the second half of 2015 would be propped up by higher inflow of European Union funds
Other Council members, in turn, drew attention to the increase in growth of prices of services and industrial producer prices in the recent period, which might indicate growing domestic inflationary pressure
At the same time, members deemed that due to lags in monetary policy transmission, the shape of the 2017 fiscal policy was of key importance for the current interest rates decisions
When referring to the Polish economy, the Council members assessed that the incoming data as of September suggested that there had been a relatively rapid rebound in economic activity
When analysing price developments in Poland, it was stressed that the annual consumer price index remained negative, yet signs of a reversal in deflationary trends had appeared
It was argued that the level of production capacity utilisation had once again increased in 2010 Q3, which in combination with the very good financial results of enterprises in the first half of 2010 should support the revival of investment activity
When analysing changes in energy commodity prices, it was noted that oil prices persisted at levels markedly higher than the year before, having fluctuated significantly in the recent period
In this context, it was pointed out that the concerns of the surveyed households about unemployment had risen recently
Attention was also drawn to the persistently low unemployment rate
While analysing inflation developments, the Council members pointed to further decline in CPI inflation which went down to 2.4 in December 2012, i.e
Yet, other members of the Council emphasized that inflation in Poland was higher than in Western European countries mainly due to considerable rises in regulated prices, which were beyond the direct impact of monetary policy
While analysing inflationary developments in Poland, it was pointed out that the annual consumer price growth had decreased in December
A few Council members also drew attention to the fact that in recent quarters, domestic demand had been supported by a considerable rise in inventories, which could have resulted from shortage of demand for already produced goods
They also stressed that the crisis-driven zloty depreciation which significantly exceeded the depreciation of the equilibrium exchange rate was conducive to the rise in inflation in Poland in 2009
The further path of the pandemic remained the key risk factor here
Other Council members also stressed that wage levels in Poland remained low compared to West European countries and pointed out that their growth required an increase in innovation and technological advancement of Polish production
They emphasised the improvement in enterprises expectations about their economic situation and future demand as well as the fact that, although economic recovery had not translated yet into a rise in corporate investment activity, a higher than in the previous quarters percentage of firms surveyed by the NBP continued the already started investment projects
Some Council members emphasized that the way in which fiscal imbalances are contained is important
It was emphasised that the European Central Bank ECB was keeping the deposit rate below zero while conducting asset purchases and signalling the maintenance of loose monetary policy in the coming quarters
Attention was also drawn to the fact that despite higher CPI at the end of the year, the average annual inflation had stood at 2.3
rates deflated with expected inflation, remained positive, which combined with the output gap remaining negative, could justify further NBP rate cuts
It was emphasized that despite the persisting risk of further turmoil in the global economy, the hitherto observed recovery in major developed economies  although not very strong  seems relatively sustainable
At the same time, the ECB continued to purchase financial assets, although since October at a reduced scale, and reaffirmed its guidance to terminate the purchase programme by year-end
The main reasons for that are the fall in crude oil prices in the recent months and a reduction in energy tariffs on sale and distribution of gas and electricity for households effective from the beginning of 2016
It was emphasised that stronger than projected investment growth in 2007 Q3 suggested the possibility of faster growth in potential output and weakening inflationary pressure in the medium term
Some Council members argued, however, that business operations of domestic banks generated considerable profits for their foreign owners, and hence the risk of significant lending constraints was not great
Moreover, it was indicated that nominal wage growth was lower than inflation
In reference to the United States, it was underlined that the Federal Reserve would probably continue to gradually reduce the accommodative stance of its monetary policy, announcing in the near future the phasing out of reinvestment of maturing securities
These members pointed out that an additional source of shocks in international financial markets could be the bursting of bubbles in other asset markets, whose formation had been driven  in their opinion  by the unconventional policies of central banks
At the meeting, the Monetary Policy Council discussed primarily the outlook for economic growth and inflation abroad and in Poland, the situation in the labour and credit markets and zloty exchange rate developments
They underlined that deposits withdrawn from the banking sector could be spent on consumption and investments
As a result, the current interest rate level help to keep the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintain macroeconomic stability
A few Council members also underlined that interest rate cuts may contribute to the fall in deposits in the banking sector
In the opinion of the Council, an additional argument for the NBP interest rate stabilisation was uncertainty regarding domestic and external conditions for monetary policy
Hence, the majority of the Council members judged that the current level of interest rates was conducive to keeping the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic stability
It was also indicated that there was a marked slowdown in producer price growth despite a significant increase in industrial output
The majority of the Council members pointed out that, given strength and persistence of the current shocks that remained beyond the impact of domestic monetary policy, a return of inflation towards the NBP inflation target would be gradual
Council members emphasised that prolonged deflation in Poland was mainly related to the factors beyond the reach of domestic monetary policy, among others, low commodity prices and low price growth abroad
While assessing the global economic situation, some members of the Council emphasised that the improvement in economic climate in the euro-area economy was relatively small and the forecast economic growth in the region remained considerably below potential
At the same time, the ECB had extended the indicated period of keeping interest rates unchanged, while signalling the possibility of further monetary policy easing
Referring to the outlook for economic growth over the longer run, certain Council members highlighted government infrastructure projects, which would prop up the production capacity of the Polish economy
Moreover, some Council members argued that the fact that lending to the enterprise sector was markedly lower than a year ago could signal slow growth of this sectors investment
Faster GDP growth in the coming quarters will be supported by a rebound in investment growth resulting from further rise in the use of EU funds under the new financial framework
In this context, some members of the Council pointed out that lowering the NBP interest rates currently to excessively low levels might later on require a relatively faster and stronger tightening of the monetary policy in order to stabilize inflation at the level of the inflation target
In the opinion of the majority of the Council members, should the uncertainty about the pandemic and its impact on the economy subside, and forecasts suggest a continuation of favourable economic conditions and the risk of inflation running above the NBPs inflation target in the coming years, it would be warranted to consider adjusting monetary policy
At the same time, some Council members drew attention to the fact that the fall in total employment in annual terms observed in the LFS data for 2022 Q3, the results of the PMI surveys indicating plans to reduce employment, and the growing concerns of households about the rise in unemployment suggest a deteriorating labour market outlook
Some Council members observed that low demand in the economy contributed to a further rise in the unemployment rate, which, in their opinion, might have an adverse effect on human capital, and, consequently, the economys potential product
As a result, economic growth in Poland might prove to be stronger than previously forecasted
In turn, growth in construction and assembly output in November was close to the October figure, whereas some Council members emphasised that growing costs of financing were strongly undermining the outlook for the construction sector as indicated by, among others, the declining number of home construction starts
Moreover, it was assessed that the strong rise in corporate investment observed in the past few quarters would result in labour productivity continuing at a relatively high level, contributing to the improving of the unfavourable relation between the wage and labour productivity growth in the time to come
The rationale for this decision was the ongoing economic recovery, which should contribute to inflation rising close to the NBP inflation target over the projection horizon
Moreover, regarding the structure of GDP growth, it was underlined that in 2017 growth was also driven by strong external demand reflected in a positive contribution of net exports to GDP growth in the second half of 2017
Some members of the Council also highlighted the risk of Poland facing elevated capital outflows, driven by the euro area crisis and unfavourable capital position of European banks, and, as a result, limited credit supply to Polish entities
It was also emphasized that the increase in excise tax on alcohol assumed in the preliminary draft Budget Act, and much stronger increase in excise tax on tobacco products than planned in the so-called road map, would contribute to higher CPI growth in 2025
The Council decided to lower the NBP basic interest rates by 0.25 percentage points to the following levels reference rate to 2.50, lombard rate to 4.00, deposit rate to 1.00, rediscount rate to 2.75
the euro area countries, including Germany
Yet, some members of the Council assessed that recession in the global economy might last longer that currently expected, and improvement of the situation in the financial markets might only be temporary
It was emphasised that GDP growth will be supported by the revival in consumer demand
Certain Council members also pointed out that the government measures aimed at shielding mortgage borrowers, i.a
While arguing in favour of accelerating interest rate hikes, some members of the Council justified it through uncertainty about the developments of the zloty exchange rate
However, it was also pointed out that inflation was being mitigated by the reduction in tax rates under the Anti-Inflation Shield
Some Council members stressed that the persistence of uncertainty regarding the domestic and external developments also spoke in favour of interest rate stability
While discussing the outlook for inflation in Poland, the majority of the Council members pointed out that a further decline in price growth was expected
Some Council members assessed that lower than expected general government deficit will partly offset rising demand in the private sector and mitigate its effect on inflation
At the same time, it was pointed out that although subsequent quarters might bring an economic slowdown, as suggested by most forecasts, including the NBPs November projection, economic growth in the coming quarters might be faster than currently forecast owing to Polish companies considerable resilience to the crisis abroad
Certain Council members expressed the opinion that the fall in economic activity might be accompanied by an increase in price growth in the medium term
Certain Council members observed that improving labour market conditions had not yet generated any tangible increase in nominal wage growth in the economy
It was emphasised that in the last three months inflation had fallen by over 5 percentage points
When referring to the global economic outlook, it was stated that current forecasts pointed to further relatively fast global GDP growth in 2022, although slower than in 2021
Some of the Council members pointed to the fact that monetary policy tightening was conducted in economies characterised by heightened inflation and substantial external imbalances
The Council members underlined that  in line with the March inflation projection  following a considerable increase in the first months of the year, inflation would stabilise at a moderate level in the following quarters
A slump in consumer loans was also pointed out, yet it was emphasized that this was due to the banks tightening their lending policies in response to worsening credit quality and regulatory changes
This should lead to an increase in labour productivity and production potential of the economy and therefore constrain the inflationary pressure related to swift economic growth
In the opinion of some members of the Council, the US economy could be gradually returning to equilibrium, albeit at higher unemployment rate and weaker potential output growth
At the meeting it was noted that in the first half of 2024 average inflation amounted to 2.7, and was thus consistent with the inflation target
Consequently, the Council concluded that, in order to strive for bringing inflation down to the NBP target in the medium term, NBP interest rates should be raised again
While discussing developments in Polands real economy, it was assessed that in 2016 Q4 GDP growth was probably still subdued
In line with the central path of the November projection  under the assumption of unchanged interest rates  inflation would return to the NBP inflation target in 2025
At the meeting, it was noted that the economic conditions in the external environment of the Polish economy remained weakened, and that uncertainty about the activity outlook persisted
The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged at the following levels reference rate at 4.50, lombard rate at 6.00, deposit rate at 3.00 and rediscount rate at 4.75
Those members emphasised that an overly expansive fiscal policy in the conditions of increasing inflationary pressure could lead to a policy-mix which is unfavourable from the point of view of long-term economic growth
While discussing factors impacting inflationary pressure abroad, attention was drawn to a slight increase in oil prices and their expected stabilisation in the coming years
Some Council members argued, however, that given no risk of overshooting the inflation target in the coming quarters, it was difficult to assess when it might be justified to consider an increase in the NBP interest rates
Yet some Council members pointed out in this context that although the situation in the labour market remained very good, the annual growth rate of employment in the enterprise sector declined and wage growth remained stable
Certain Council members judged that inflation might remain heightened in 2022
The meeting also focused on dilemmas connected with the interest rate policy in the longer term
The rising growth of food prices was also emphasised
The discussion at the meeting focused on the outlook for economic growth in Poland and abroad, situation and outlook for public finance, inflation developments in Poland, zloty exchange rate developments and credit market situation
With regard to the economic situation in the external environment of the Polish economy, it was noted that in China GDP growth had also decelerated in 2019 Q2, hitting the lowest point since 1992
In their opinion, this would be due to a high probability of inflation remaining at a heightened level in the coming quarters despite the expected slowdown in economic growth, as supported by lower responsiveness of inflation to the negative output gap, stronger exchange rate pass-through on inflation amidst large and one-directional exchange rate fluctuations and a relatively strong rise in money supply
In the opinion of the Council members, owing to the increased use of shale oil in the United States and the high oil stocks, the prices of oil have currently become less sensitive to changes in global economic conditions and to OPEC decisions to restrict oil production
Other Council members also pointed out that in previous months  following the earlier strong growth  interest rates on certain types of loans had declined somewhat
It was emphasized that high demand in the labour market persisted, which was reflected in declining unemployment and rising employment levels
These Council members also judged that the likely decline in the inflow of employees from abroad would also boost wage rises the following year
At the same time, it was underlined that in recent months the prices of certain agricultural commodities around the world had also risen significantly
The majority of the Council members also highlighted the fact that the temporary rise in inflation anticipated for 2020 Q1 would result mainly from factors beyond the scope of domestic monetary policy, including regulatory factors and supply shocks
It was highlighted that wage growth remained moderate in spite of improving labour market conditions and PPI growth had been negative for four years
In the United States, in turn, GDP growth in 2011 Q3 accelerated slightly
Some members of the Council pointed out that prospects for economic activity in the euro area, including Germany, also for 2023 were unfavourable and GDP growth might be close to zero
At the same time, it was emphasised that, due to the forecast temporary nature of the current rise in inflation, the still subdued economic activity compared to the pre-pandemic trends and uncertainty about the future economic situation, the major central banks were keeping interest rates low, continuing asset purchases, and signalling the maintenance of loose monetary policy in the future
The majority of the Council members recognised that the decision to lower interest rates at the current meeting complemented the interest rate cut cycle
However, certain Council members noted that the investment rate was still lower than before the global financial crisis
In the opinion of the Council members, favourable economic conditions will continue in the coming quarters, although GDP growth will probably slow down slightly compared to the second half of 2017
According to these Council members, such a move would curb the rise in real estate prices, contributing to increasing their affordability
It was also highlighted that the current elevated inflation was driven, to a great extent, by factors beyond the impact of the domestic monetary policy
Therefore they would have only a temporary impact on inflation, while at the same time, they would put a drag on economic activity
At the same time, it was judged that the potential weakening in Polands exports to the Eastern markets, particularly food exports, could curb price growth in the domestic market
According to those Council members, the relatively favourable assessment of Polands economic situation and the reduction of new issues of Treasury securities by some countries characterised with currently largest fiscal imbalance might be helpful in sustaining high demand for Polish Treasury securities
These Council members judged that the expected inflation growth would be driven by an intensification of domestic inflationary pressure as evidenced by the forecast growth in both core inflation and the value added deflator
Other Council members indicated that deterioration in economic activity abroad and, consequently, in the Polish economy, might occur, among other things, due to a difficult fiscal situation in the developed countries
Moreover, a few Council members noted that the situation in Ukraine and the adverse weather conditions in many major food commodity exporters resulted in a considerable rise in their prices in the global markets
They also pointed out that it was not yet clear when Poland would join the ERM II and so the considerations connected with ERM II membership should not be taken into account in current interest rate decisions
Moreover, certain Council members pointed out that in the coming months investment might be supported by the implementation of the public infrastructure projects
In their opinion, the need to modernise the current energy infrastructure, related i.a
The majority of the Council members also emphasized that NBP interest rate increase was an adjustment to the current and anticipated macroeconomic situation in Poland and was aimed to ensure that real interest rates are kept above zero
Council members expressed the opinion that despite stronger economic growth, inflation  in light of the March projection  will return to the target only gradually, and will remain below the target at least throughout this year
At the meeting, the Monetary Policy Council analysed the situation in the external environment of the Polish economy, the outlook for economic growth and inflation in Poland, including the prospects for inflation returning to the target, and discussed the current and future decisions on the NBP interest rates
Consequently  as pointed out by the Council members  in May the annual growth of energy prices reached 33 and that of food prices exceeded 13
The discussion at the meeting focused on the outlook for economic growth abroad and in Poland, medium-term inflation outlook, fiscal policy and credit market conditions
In turn, a marked increase in asset prices amidst persisting moderate global economic growth proves, in the opinion of these Council members, that additional liquidity had been used to invest in financial assets
Attention was also drawn to the signs of cost pressure in the economy, manifested in the positive and rising growth in producer prices excluding energy and an acceleration in unit labour cost growth
At the same time, construction and assembly production continued to grow
Council members also pointed out that weak growth of foreign demand, notwithstanding its slight acceleration, remained a factor curbing GDP growth in Poland in the first quarter
At the same time, Council members indicated that considering the persisting tensions in international financial markets the weakening of the zloty exchange rate may be an important risk factor for the fall of CPI inflation to the inflation target
While discussing economic situation in Poland, Council members pointed out that economic growth had slowed down in recent months
While addressing inflation expectations, it was emphasised that although one-year ahead inflation forecasts by financial sector analysts were consistent with the NBPs inflation target, expectations of households and enterprises were largely based on current inflation
It was pointed out, however, that the Polish currency had depreciated less than many emerging market currencies
The Council decided to lower the NBP basic interest rates by 0.25 percentage points to the following levels reference rate to 3.00, lombard rate to 4.50, deposit rate 1.50, rediscount rate to 3.25
While analyzing the situation in the euro area, the contrast between GDP growth in this economy as compared to GDP growth in the American economy was emphasized
There had been a sharp fall in equity prices, and a decline in government bond yields
It was emphasised that the Council flexibly determined the desirable time necessary to bring inflation back to the target, as bringing inflation rapidly back to the target might entail significant costs to macroeconomic and financial stability
While considering the decision on interest rates, some members of the Council assessed that the risk of growing wage and inflationary pressure connected with accelerating GDP growth and the risk of growing inflation expectations justified increasing the NBP interest rates
It was pointed out, however, that wage growth is expected to outpace labour productivity growth, which would lead to a gradual increase in unit labour costs growth
During its meeting the Monetary Policy Council discussed primarily the situation in the external environment of the Polish economy, including the possible consequences of the fiscal crisis in Greece, and the outlook for economic growth and inflation in Poland
It was judged that the probable fall in heating fuel prices, in particularly of coal, may also have been conducive to curbing inflation
At the same time, certain Council members cited still moderate leading economic indicators
Council members judged that in the coming months economic activity could be expected to recover further
A significant drop in inflation in 2010 would be driven  in the opinion of those members  by the delayed effects of labour market deterioration resulting both in reduced consumption demand of households and slower growth of costs in enterprises
Those Council members emphasized that strong dependence of the Polish economy on the economic developments in Germany might imply that an expected slight deceleration of GDP growth in Germany could be followed by a reduction of GDP growth in Poland
While discussing the NBP interest rates, the majority of the Council members assessed, as at previous meetings, that at the current meeting the NBP interest rates should continue to be lowered, which should support economic activity and consequently reduce the risk of inflation remaining below the target in the medium term
In the assessment of those Council members, the extent of a possible decline in economic growth in Poland would be significantly smaller than in the United States or the euro-area
Yet, it was stressed that GDP growth, having picked up considerably in 2017, might weaken slightly in the coming years and should not exceed potential output growth to a large extent
They argued that a further monetary policy tightening in Poland would increase interest rate disparity between Poland on the one hand and the United States and the euro area on the other, which might encourage the inflow of short-term capital to Poland and be conducive to excessive zloty exchange rate appreciation
A further decline in inflation was also indicated by external forecasts
In this context, attention was drawn to the considerable inflow of refugees to Poland, which would generate additional demand for consumer goods and services and would require higher investments related to the migrants, including investment in expanding the health care system, education and increasing the availability of housing
The decline in investment was partly related to the completion of projects cofinanced with EU funds under the previous financial framework as well as statistical effects related to the implementation of large investments in the energy sector in 2016 Q1
Certain Council members also pointed to a possible pick-up in housing investment, driven by the improvement in the labour market situation and the decline in interest rates on loans
Some Council members were of the opinion that the impact of the slowdown in China on the global economy would be amplified by potentially accompanying deceleration in other Asian economies growth
Against this background, those Council members argued that the observed decline in global oil prices would support domestic demand as well as  through higher GDP growth abroad  Polish exports
At the same time it was underlined that the negative impact of weakened activity in services on the overall economic situation was so significant that 2021 Q1 would most likely see a fall in GDP in quarterly terms
It was judged, that according to the current forecasts, the annual price growth might decline below 3 in March 2024, i.e
While discussing the economic growth in Poland in the years to come, some Council members emphasised that GDP growth should gradually decrease in the next years, which would be easing the demand pressure
They assessed that investment growth could be faster than the central projection path due to more efficient absorption of EU funds than assumed in the projection
Thus, the Council judged that the current level of interest rates was conducive to keeping the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic stability
In this context, certain Council members judged that loose monetary conditions in major advanced economies had contributed to a strong rise in financial asset and real estate prices in previous years
In the euro area, economic growth declined in 2019 Q4, amid the ongoing downturn in industry
Moreover, some Council members argued that a more comprehensive assessment of the outlook for inflation and economic growth in Poland will be possible after considering the June inflation and GDP projection
However, attention was also drawn to a deceleration in annual industrial production growth as well as a fall in construction and assembly output in February
It was emphasized that all the available inflation forecasts anticipate its decline within one year
Certain Council members judged that the growth of loans to enterprises was only modest, and in the case of SMEs, low
The fall in inflation in annual terms in August was mainly due to the fall in the annual growth of prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages
This was suggested by the weaker wage growth and a further slight decrease in employment in month-on-month terms in the corporate sector as well as the lower number of job offers in the recent period
However, certain Council members expressed the opinion that in view of the still favourable economic conditions in Poland, the high price growth and the heightened inflation expectations, as well as due to the easing of fiscal policy, the hitherto scale of interest rate hikes was, in their view, insufficient to ensure the return of inflation to the target in the medium term
In addition, certain Council members expressed the opinion that embargo imposed by Russia on Polish food products had been conducive to lower food prices in Poland
They emphasized that it was necessary to accept the new reality, namely that in the years to come growth in the Western European countries would reach approx
However, some Council members pointed out that the pace of GDP growth did not ensure fast closure of the output gap and there were no signs of a marked pick-up in the economic activity in the following quarters
It was assessed that economic growth was still driven primarily by increasing consumer demand, supported by rising employment and wages, good consumer sentiment and disbursement of child and social benefits
The Council members expressed the view that the problems of the German economy might largely be of structural nature
At the same time, in the opinion of certain Council members, over the longer run investment growth might be additionally backed by the Housing Plus programme
At the meeting a motion to symmetrically narrow the corridor between the NBP deposit rate and the NBP lombard rate by a total of 50 basis points was put forward
According to the preliminary draft Budget Act, the government is planning the 2025 public finance sector deficit in ESA2010 terms at the level of 5.5 of GDP, considerably above the level announced by the government in April 2024
It was noted that although changes in this category seemed ambiguous, yet they probably resulted from companies activities aimed at stock replenishment in anticipation of high demand for their products in the quarters to come
A view was expressed that given the elevated inflation  including inflation net of food and energy prices  as well as the recovery in consumer demand and high wage growth, the current level of NBP interest rates, amid the current developments in inflation expectations, was too low to ensure the sustainable return of inflation to the target in the medium term
At the same time, those members emphasised that in case these problems aggravated, an outflow of foreign capital could occur that would be conducive to a weakening of the zloty
It was pointed out that according to the March projection, CPI inflation in subsequent years would exceed this years level while remaining moderate and close to 2.5
While analysing the outlook for economic growth, the Council members judged that GDP growth in 2019 might be slightly higher than expected in the March projection
They pointed out that amid the ongoing economic recovery, the observed rise in inflation above the NBP inflation target might lead to an increase in inflation expectations and the consolidation of inflation at a level above the NBP inflation target in the coming quarters
Yet, other Council members pointed to substantial uncertainty regarding the magnitude of the impact of the economic slowdown on inflation, as well as the fact that despite the downward revision of the economic growth forecasts many external forecasts continue to expect inflation to stay above 2.5 in 2013
It was observed that preliminary GDP estimates suggested a possible pick-up in investment growth in 2019 Q4
Other members of the Council argued that higher than expected rise in inflation in March 2009 indicated that even amidst strong economic slowdown, exchange rate depreciation translates significantly into a rise in consumer prices in Poland
The majority of the Council members assessed that in the coming quarters inflation would remain moderate
As deflation was primarily caused by supply-side factors, in the opinion of those members of the Council, it was boosting households purchasing power and reducing corporate costs, thus supporting domestic economic growth
In addition, it was assessed that economic conditions in the United States were strong
The growing role of domestic demand, including investment and private consumption, in Germanys economic growth means lower sensitivity of this economy to fluctuations in external demand
It was also indicated that in 2023 GDP growth was to be lower than expected in July, while in the next two years it was to be somewhat faster
However, other Council members were of the opinion that the increasing scale of child benefit payments along with the rising birth rate, the improvement in the financial situation of some consumers due to the lowering of the statutory retirement age, and in 2019 also the possible increase in social benefits and wages in the budget sector, could boost GDP growth
However, some Council members argued that the price dynamics of certain services could be a factor that would hamper the fall in inflation
It was pointed out that the process of lowering inflation in the major economies was slow as core inflation remained elevated, particularly due to the persistence of high service price growth amid fast wage growth
Meanwhile, the scale of the rise in oil prices was limited by both lower current demand and the deteriorating outlook for demand for oil related to weaker global economic conditions and tensions between the United States and China
These Council members pointed out that the decision would directly lead to a further reduction in instalments on loans with a variable interest rate taken out by enterprises and households
Similar trends may be observed in the monthly data on employment in the enterprise sector and unemployment as registered by the Labour Offices
It was underlined that industrial output was declining in year-on-year terms in almost all major world economies and global growth forecasts were lowered
Those members assessed that the dampening effect of low growth of unit labour costs on inflation may begin to wane, as evidenced by the first  since 2008 Q2  acceleration in unit labour cost growth in the economy in 2010 Q2
At the same time, disruptions in global supply chains persisted, and prices of international transport remained elevated
It was emphasised that a further tightening of the macroprudential policy at the beginning of this year would probably limit mortgage lending growth
Some members of the Council also addressed changes in the external environment of the Polish economy driven by the financial crisis, which were likely to impact the developments of the equilibrium interest rate in Poland
A motion to raise the required reserve rate by 50 basis points was put forward
Some Council members emphasized that given the likelihood of the Federal Reserve starting QE tapering, the sustainability of recovery in the US economy was not certain
On the other hand, some Council members emphasised that in certain developed economies the interest rate hiking cycle had already begun
A few Council members pointed out, however, that no declarations as to probable future course of monetary policy should be made
Certain Council members noted that in recent months there were more signs of a deterioration in global economic conditions
However, some Council members indicated that the survey data from both the Statistics Poland and the NBP signalled a gradual weakening of demand for labour in the Polish economy
During the meeting, the Council stated that global economic growth continued at relatively slow pace
It was pointed out that following a decline caused by weather conditions, shale oil extraction had rebounded at the beginning of October, while exports of this commodity from the United States had surged
It was assessed that  although the excessive deficit procedure had officially been initiated  the preliminary draft Budget Act for 2025 did not indicate fiscal policy tightening which would favour a reduction in inflationary pressure
Certain Council members underlined in addition that the negative impact of the fall in commodity prices should be fading out, which would be conducive to higher CPI inflation later in the projection horizon
Growth in consumption in the coming quarters should also be driven by emerging effects of an acceleration in disbursement of the child benefits
Moreover, few Council members pointed out that the expansionary monetary policy of the major central banks had resulted in an increased upward pressure on currencies of some countries with a significant interest rate differential to the major economies
In this context, certain Council members pointed out that  particularly in view of the need for increased public expenditure on the military and on energy transformation  the room for increasing the expansiveness of fiscal policy was limited and rather consolidation policies should be expected
Referring to monetary policy abroad, attention was drawn to a marked shift in the rhetoric of the main central banks in recent months
The Council devoted a lot of attention to the outlook for global economic growth, while at the same time pointing out the considerable uncertainty surrounding the activity in the world economy both in the near future and in the longer term
The European Central Bank was keeping its interest rates close to zero, including the deposit rate below zero, and was reinvesting maturing securities bought under the asset purchase programme
They pointed out that in January 2008 zloty exchange rate continued to be stronger than accounted for in the October inflation projection
Deteriorating fiscal situation increases uncertainty about the moment of zloty entering the ERM II
It was also underlined that in recent months the global prices of some agricultural commodities, in particular wheat, had also risen
In this regard, attention was drawn to a decline in inflation in the euro area, including in the euro areas major economies, significantly below the level consistent with the price stability definition of the European Central Bank
At the same time, it was pointed out that a reduction in some tax rates as part of the so called Anti-inflationary Shield would have a curbing effect on inflation, although it would be difficult to define its horizon at present
It was pointed out that the majority of financial market participants also judged the higher level of price growth to be temporary, as evidenced by the decline in long-term inflation expectations and bond yields in the largest developed economies
The discussion at the meeting focused on the zloty exchange rate developments, the outlook for economic growth in Poland and abroad and credit market conditions
Certain Council members stressed that the higher global energy commodity prices had a positive impact on the outlook for the Russian economy, although this might be limited by the reduction in imports of energy commodities from Russia announced by some European countries
It was pointed out that the rise in the annual inflation in February 2008 in relation to January 2008 was primarily driven by a strong growth in regulated prices
With regard to expected inflation developments in months ahead, Council members pointed out that according to several short-term forecasts, inflation was likely to remain below the March projection
As a result, along with the expected slowdown in economic growth, inflation would stay close to the target over the monetary policy transmission horizon
While analysing labour market conditions, sustained corporate employment growth was highlighted, as well as the declining seasonally adjusted unemployment rate
Those Council members also indicated that it was difficult to assess the likelihood of reductions in VAT rates in 2014
Considering the significant role of net exports in domestic GDP growth in the recent quarters, some Council members assessed that external economic developments in 2013 might have a stronger impact on economic activity in Poland than during the 2009 slowdown
At the same time, it was noted that growth in construction and assembly output in October 2022 had been close to the average for 2022 Q3, although some Council members judged that the sharp fall in newly granted housing loans would lead to a significant decline in housing construction in the coming period
They pointed out that domestic economic activity might be limited by potentially weakening growth in the external environment of the Polish economy
Moreover, these Council members emphasised that price growth in the coming years would continue to be contained by low inflation in the environment of the Polish economy and significantly weaker forecast growth of energy prices than in previous years
Some Council members drew attention to the lower than expected growth in output and retail sales in July as well as the fall in the PMI in August, which could signal weakening growth in activity
At the meeting, a motion to cut the basic NBP interest rates by 0.25 percentage points was submitted
Moreover, these Council members pointed out that the need to take into account monetary conditions in the immediate environment of the Polish economy, including the prospect of maintaining negative interest rates in the euro area next year, also spoke in favour of keeping the current level of interest rates
Some Council members pointed out that  following a previous marked decline  profitability ratios in the non-financial enterprise sector had improved in 2024 Q2
However, the Council members differed in their assessment of the magnitude of the impact this factor may have on inflationary pressure
Some Council members judged that interest rates in this region might remain low for longer than currently signalled by the ECB, should the expected economic slowdown in the euro area prove stronger than indicated by the current forecasts and the rise in inflation be driven mainly by increasing energy prices, with continuously moderate core inflation
Council members judged that the gradual recovery in investment financed with EU funds suggested that total investment growth would be higher in the second half of 2017
In particular, these central banks were keeping interest rates low, while conducting asset purchases and signalling the maintenance of loose monetary policy in the future
They drew attention to increase in risk of longer than previously expected period of inflation remaining below the target, as suggested by the revisions of inflation forecasts
With reference to the situation in the labour market, it was stressed that the further growth in employment and reduction in unemployment in 2017 Q2 was accompanied by a pick-up in wage growth in the corporate sector and the economy as a whole
It was also pointed out that fiscal stimulus packages in most countries were accompanied by monetary policy easing, which involved interest rate cuts and asset purchases
In this context, they stressed that the current real interest rates had become relatively high as compared with those in the recent years
Moreover, these Council members observed that the pace of the economic recovery in Poland might be reduced by the lack of a visible and more durable zloty exchange rate adjustment to the global pandemic shock and to the monetary policy easing introduced by NBP
Moreover, certain Council members noted that corporate lending had accelerated of late, driven by faster growth in current loans and stable increase in investment loans
Certain Council members were of the opinion that the rise in energy commodity prices was driven by both demand factors  such as the ongoing recovery in the global economy after the pandemic crisis  and supply constraints due to the oil production policy of OPEC and Russias gas export policy
Annual growth in prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages rose in June 2024, while annual growth in energy prices declined
Other members of the Council assessed that decline in GDP growth in the United States was in line with the expectations of lower potential output growth in major developed economies after the financial crisis
Other members of the Council argued that the pass through of exchange rate changes into inflation might be limited amidst economic slowdown, and raises in administered prices are beyond the direct impact of monetary policy
They also pointed out the near-zero growth in producer prices, and emphasised that slower price growth was accompanied by slightly lower inflation expectations, both among households and enterprises
It was emphasised that the sources of higher inflation would thus include supply shocks, which at the same time would adversely affect the profitability of companies and the situation of households
As regards the impact of the exchange rate on inflation, few Council members assessed that the likely appreciation of the equilibrium exchange rate would limit the anti-inflationary influence of the exchange rate appreciation at the beginning of 2012 on domestic prices
Those members were also of the opinion that low interest rates weakened the selection of economic agents and  consequently  inhibited productivity growth
In this context it was indicated that in July 2021 annual growth in retail sales and in industrial and construction output had declined which was only partially the result of base effects
Council members pointed out that NBPs measures taken so far had contributed to ease financing conditions in Poland
Those factors included high commodity prices in the global markets, being largely the result of both rising demand for energy and food in the rapidly growing emerging markets and strongly expansionary monetary policy in the main developed countries
At the same time, according to preliminary estimates, core inflation excluding food and energy prices declined to its lowest level for over a year
They emphasised that due to the absence of pro-inflationary macroeconomic factors, price growth in 2021 would run at a moderate level, even in the event of regulatory factors boosting it
The discussion at the meeting focused on the outlook for economic growth abroad and in Poland, fiscal policy, zloty exchange rate developments and the situation in the credit market and the banking sector
These members also emphasised the absence of cost pressure in the economy, as indicated by a further producer price decline resulting from the previous sharp fall in commodity prices and moderate wage growth
They also stressed that the low growth of corporate lending was connected with very good liquidity situation of enterprises and low level of investment activity
It was indicated that the application of uniform reserve requirement ratios for all funds raised for at least 2 years would bring the Polish reserve requirement system closer to the solutions applied by the Eurosystem
A few Council members, however, were of the opinion that  if the current pace of economic growth continued  a revival in demand pressure would be conducive to higher inflation
The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged the reference rate at 1.50, the lombard rate at 2.50, the deposit rate at 0.50, the rediscount rate at 1.75
It was emphasised that weaker economic conditions in Polands immediate environment would have a negative impact on domestic GDP growth
In this context, they pointed out that the level of real interest rates  taking into account the level of inflation expected next year by these economic agents as well as by professional forecasters  remained negative
At the same time, it was pointed out that there were signals that the scale of the external shocks which had boosted inflation around the world was gradually decreasing, which  besides the gradual easing of global supply chain disruptions  was evidenced by a slight fall in oil prices
When discussing inflation developments abroad, it was pointed out that the earlier significant increase in global energy commodity prices contributed to higher inflation in many countries
It was also suggested that a better assessment of the risk of inflation overshooting the inflation target in the monetary policy transmission horizon would require macroeconomic data that were to be released before the next meeting
In addition, some Council members pointed out that the output gap would most likely remain negative over the projection horizon
A few Council members argued that low credit to GDP ratio in Poland as compared to other EU Member States suggested that the role of lending in supporting consumer demand was limited
However, it was noted that this was accompanied by measures undertaken by the Chinese authorities aimed at mitigating the scale of the slowdown
With regard to inflationary processes at home, it was pointed out that the annual consumer price growth fell yet again in October and was running below the forecasts
At the same time, in the opinion of certain Council members, the likelihood of inflation running at a level consistent with the NBP inflation target at the end of the projection horizon was too low
In the opinion of certain Council members, in particular the lowering of the retirement age could adversely affect the labour supply
They also assessed that the output gap in the economy had been negative, which had been translating into very low or even  in most cases  negative core inflation measures
Some Council members believed, however, that NBP interest rates should remain unchanged
Some members of the Council expressed the opinion that easing of the monetary policy should be implemented gradually, inter alia, due to the high uncertainty about the outlook for the global and Polish economy and about the impact of cuts in the NBP interest rates on market interest rates and domestic demand
These Council members judged that the disinflation process would be hampered by the heightened inflation expectations of households and enterprises
Moreover, some members of the Council indicated that the slowdown in economic growth in the United States would affect the economic activity in the euro area, and consequently in Poland, after a certain time lag
It was pointed out that the weakening of economic conditions was related, among others, to the slowdown in global economic growth, but was also a result of the fall in real household income, especially since it was accompanied by weak economic agents sentiments, and took place following strong monetary policy tightening
While discussing the situation on the credit market, Council members considered that growth in credit for the private sector remained moderate
In the first months of 2024, the annual CPI growth is likely to fall significantly, while the decline in core inflation will be slower
Some members of the Council indicated that the growth rate of consumer prices in the first few months of 2009 exceeded the average from the last eight years, which, by means of a base effect, might be conducive to a decline in the year-on-year inflation rate at the beginning of 2010
Those Council members argued that particularly in the case of energy prices affected by global commodity prices, the decline might be a temporary phenomenon
Yet, other Council members believed that growth of wages in the coming quarters would be close to that of labour productivity, with wage pressure remaining limited
They emphasised that, in line with the central path of the February projection based on the ECMOD model, throughout the projection horizon domestic demand would be growing faster than GDP, and GDP would remain above its potential level, which should be conducive to increased inflationary pressure
Turning to inflation developments in Poland, it was observed that consumer price growth had increased in recent months
During the meeting it was pointed out that inflation in Poland  according to the Statistics Poland flash estimate  increased to 9.2 in January 2022
At the same time, certain Council members were of the opinion that the decrease in inflation in the coming quarters might be faster than current forecasts indicated
Consequently, Council members concluded that, in order to bring inflation down to the NBP inflation target in the medium term, the NBP interest rates should be raised again
Other members argued that the recent strong appreciation of the zloty exchange rate could be temporary and therefore changes in the exchange rate should be treated as a neutral factor while taking decisions on interest rate
GDP growth was supported by robust consumer demand, benefiting from a favourable situation in the labour market, which was reflected in a decline in unemployment and a substantial rise in average wages
The economic growth would continue to be supported by strong consumer demand and investment
Those members also pointed out that due to the limited array of monetary policy tools, corporate restructuring should be supported primarily by structural policy
It was further pointed out that the currencies of Polands other trading partners had depreciated much more than the zloty
Some Council members stressed that in the event of significant price growth that would jeopardise meeting the inflation target in the medium term, it might be justified to consider an increase in the NBP interest rates in the coming quarters
At the meeting a motion was submitted to lower NBP interest rates by 0.50 percentage points
Moreover, they pointed out that the recently observed wage demands in the public finance sector may be conducive to wage demands in the private sector of the economy
It was noted that economic growth would still be driven by consumption demand growth, supported by the sustained rise in household disposable income due to favourable labour market conditions combined with the increase in the minimum wage in 2020, as well as the disbursement of social benefits and the tax cuts
