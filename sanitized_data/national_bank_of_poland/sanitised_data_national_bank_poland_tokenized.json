    "2013": [
        "At its meeting, members of the Monetary Policy Council discussed the current and future monetary policy decisions in the context of macroeconomic developments in Poland and abroad.",
        "While referring to economic activity abroad, the members of the Council pointed to global economic growth remaining moderate (due to persistently modest recovery in developed economies and historically low rates of GDP growth in emerging countries).",
        "In particular, it was pointed out that economic conditions in the United States had improved, which was, however, partly driven by still highly expansionary monetary policy in that country.",
        "Some Council members emphasized that given the likelihood of the Federal Reserve starting QE tapering, the sustainability of recovery in the US economy was not certain.",
        "At the same time, these Council members were of the opinion that QE tapering might be accompanied by an easing of other parameters of the Fed’s monetary policy, including changes to parameters of forward guidance.",
        "A few Council members pointed to the fact that QE policy had changed financial markets’ response to macroeconomic data, and its withdrawal could trigger additional volatility in the financial markets.",
        "While referring to the euro area, it was emphasised that due to the persistently high unemployment, the ongoing deleveraging process and uncertainty over the outlook for the euro area economy, GDP growth in 2013 Q3 was only slightly above zero.",
        "In the opinion of the Council, one could hardly expect its tangible acceleration in subsequent quarters.",
        "Some Council members indicated, however, that fiscal tightening had been scaled back in many euro area countries, which should have a positive impact on their economic growth in the short run.",
        "It was also pointed out that the November ECB decision to lower the main interest rate and the possibility of further easing of monetary policy in the euro area may support demand growth in that economy.",
        "While analysing situation in the developing countries, some Council members indicated that growth outlook for major emerging economies had recently been revised downwards.",
        "In this context, a few Council members emphasised that the weakening GDP growth in those countries could be a long-lasting phenomenon, related the so called middle-income trap.",
        "Moreover, in the opinion of those Council members, cyclical factors (i.e.",
        "moderate scale of recovery in developed countries) also dimmed the prospects of a marked GDP acceleration in emerging economies (in particular in those that are commodity exporters).",
        "While discussing inflationary processes, it was indicated that global inflation remained low, which was supported by moderate economic activity and a fall in commodity prices.",
        "Some Council members pointed to the recently rising risk of deflation in some countries.",
        "In particular, it was probably the risk of inflation falling below zero that had made the ECB lower its main interest rate, and led the Czech National Bank to introduce an asymmetric exchange rate target.",
        "At the same time, a few Council members assessed that the unprecedented scale of quantitative easing carried out by major central banks might, in the long run, fuel concerns about a substantial rise in inflation across the world.",
        "Other Council members indicated that the additional liquidity provided to the financial system by major central banks had not, as yet, translated into increased money supply.",
        "Therefore, no inflationary pressures were observed in the consumer goods market.",
        "In turn, a marked increase in asset prices amidst persisting moderate global economic growth proves, in the opinion of these Council members, that additional liquidity had been used to invest in financial assets.",
        "While referring to domestic economic activity, Council members noted that GDP data had confirmed the continuation of a gradual recovery in 2013 Q3.",
        "At the same time, however, some Council members emphasized that although domestic demand had picked up – after a few quarters of a decline – its rise was small and net exports continued to be the main driver of growth.",
        "In this context, a few Council members pointed out that given the low growth in the external environment of the Polish economy and the persisting risk of deterioration in economic conditions abroad, the strength of further economic recovery in Poland was uncertain.",
        "At the same time, it was noted that there was some slowdown in industrial output and retail sales growth in October, which was however accompanied by further improvement in economic climate indicators (including PMI in manufacturing) and a smaller decline in construction and assembly output.",
        "Referring to the situation in the labour market, it was pointed out that wage growth had accelerated slightly, which could support further rebound in consumption.",
        "At the same time, the still elevated unemployment rate showed that no loosening of wage discipline should be expected.",
        "In this context, it was emphasized that the growth of unit labour cost in the economy had remained low for the last few years.",
        "While assessing the situation in the credit market, some Council members emphasized that easing of consumer loan policy of financial institutions, accompanied by an improvement in consumer sentiment, had contributed to a marked rise in these loans over the recent months (which supported recovery in consumer demand).",
        "The rise in consumer loans combined with a stable increase in mortgage loans, translated into gradual acceleration of lending to households.",
        "In turn, lending growth to enterprises remained low, in particular in the segment of investment loans.",
        "This may point to further sluggish growth in investment demand of corporations, above all under capacity underutilization in the economy.",
        "While discussing the developments in the banking sector, it was indicated that the growth in household deposits continued to weaken.",
        "Referring to inflation, Council members pointed out that in October 2013 CPI had decreased and inflation had remained markedly below the target.",
        "In addition, it was indicated that core inflation remained low, producer prices continued to decline, and inflation forecasts of financial sector analysts decreased.",
        "Some Council members emphasized that available forecasts pointed to a low risk of inflation exceeding the target in 2014.",
        "However, a few Council members noted the fact that core inflation ran at a level that in the past did not guarantee CPI inflation remaining within the tolerance band of deviations from the target.",
        "In the opinion of the Council, NBP interest rates should remain unchanged at the current meeting.",
        "It was emphasized that the reduction in interest rates in the first half of 2013 and their stabilisation in subsequent quarters supported the recovery of the domestic economy, a return of inflation to the target and stabilisation in the financial markets.",
        "The Council maintains its assessment that gradual economic recovery is likely to continue in the coming quarters, however, inflationary pressures will remain subdued.",
        "Therefore, the Council confirmed that it would be justified to maintain interest rates at current levels at least until the end of the first half of 2014.",
        "The Council kept NBP’s interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 2.50%, the lombard rate at 4.00%, the deposit rate at 1.00% and the rediscount rate at 2.75%.",
        "At its meeting, members of the Monetary Policy Council discussed the current and future monetary policy decisions in the context of macroeconomic developments in Poland and abroad.",
        "Referring to external conditions, it was noted that the global economic growth is moderate and there are no clear signals – neither from developed nor from developing economies – pointing to its significant acceleration in the coming quarters.",
        "Members of the Council discussed in particular the situation in the United States, where before the beginning of a fiscal year, the U.S. Congress did not adopt the budget law.",
        "According to some members of the Council this may negatively affect US economic activity, although other members of the Council assessed that the impact will probably be limited.",
        "Yet – according to the Council – difficulties with the adoption of the budget in the United States may have a negative impact on negotiations about increasing the US debt limit, and so on sentiments in the global financial markets.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that the fiscal situation can be a factor discouraging the Federal Reserve from QE tapering.",
        "While analyzing the situation in the euro area, some Council members pointed out that the situation in that economy is a bit better than before.",
        "They emphasized in particular that the slightly positive – for the first time in six quarters – euro area GDP growth in 2013 Q2 was supported by an increase in external demand (especially from the United States and Japan), a relatively stable situation on the financial markets of the euro area and an improved sentiment of both consumers and producers.",
        "It was noted that the high level of PMI and an increase of most of other economic indicators signal a high probability of euro area GDP growth remaining positive in 2013 Q3.",
        "At the same time, members of the Council pointed out that euro area GDP growth in 2013 Q2 was also related to one-off factors.",
        "Moreover, a few Council members argued that the lack of prospects for a considerable revival in economic growth in major emerging economies may have a negative impact on economic activity in Europe.",
        "Some Council members argued that, given moderate recovery in the global economic growth, pressure on commodity prices will probably remain low.",
        "A few Council members noted that also the end of a period of high prices in the long-term commodity cycle may contribute to lower commodity prices in the coming years.",
        "Other Council members, however, pointed to a recent rise in enterprises’ concerns about the future path of commodity prices.",
        "If these concerns prove to be justified, i.e., if commodity prices actually increase, the growth – due to its strong impact on domestic prices – may have significantly increased inflation in Poland.",
        "While analysing business conditions in Poland, some Council members noted that revival of economic growth is more gradual than in 2010.",
        "To a significant extent this is related to a persistently slower – as compared to the period prior to the global financial crisis – GDP growth abroad.",
        "According to a few Council members, economic activity might also be hampered by increased unemployment.",
        "In their view, unemployment – especially among young and low-skilled employees – is additionally raised by rising minimum wages in Poland, which exceeds average wage growth.",
        "Those Council member assessed, moreover, that both the persistently lower growth abroad and lower employment might negatively affect potential output growth in the medium term.",
        "Other Council members indicated, however, that the minimum wage in Poland was relatively low as compared to other EU countries and, in their opinion, it has no considerable impact on the levels of employment and unemployment in Poland.",
        "While discussing the current business conditions, it was noted that some data on domestic economic activity proved worse than anticipated.",
        "In particular, the growth of industrial output and of construction output in August 2013 showed some deceleration of positive tendencies observed in the previous period – i.e.",
        "recently seen acceleration of industrial output was slower and decelerating fall in construction output was again somewhat more negative.",
        "At the same time it was emphasized that annual GDP growth would most likely be higher in Q3 as compared to Q2.",
        "In particular, favourable data on retail sales and improvement in leading business indicators, including a relatively high PMI, signalled steadily accelerating growth.",
        "Attention was also drawn to the signs of gradual improvement in the labour market.",
        "August saw a slight decline in the registered unemployment rate (in seasonal adjusted terms) and a further growth in employment in the corporate sector (in monthly terms).",
        "Moreover, a few Council members noted that activity is reviving in numerous sectors of the economy, which, in their opinion, reflects a broad-based and most likely robust economic recovery.",
        "Some members of the Council argued, that despite gradually accelerating activity, output gap would continue to be negative in the subsequent quarters, hence, there was no substantial risk to price stability on the part of domestic factors.",
        "Those members – seeing also low risk of considerable increase in external inflationary pressures – expected that inflation would run below the target also in 2014.",
        "Members of the Council indicated that in line with forecast covering the next 4 quarters, inflation was expected to remain below the target.",
        "Also core inflation in a one year-horizon was about to run at a relatively low level, i.e.",
        "below the multi-year average.",
        "Other Council members, however, pointed out that currently the potential output growth might be lower than implied by the available estimates, and thus, the negative output gap may get closed already in the near future.",
        "Furthermore – they believe – given the risk of inflation rising due to factors linked to food and energy prices, core inflation should run well below the currently forecasted values in order to expect that CPI inflation would remain within the tolerance band of deviations from the inflation target.",
        "In this context those Council members noted that inflationary expectations of enterprises recently increased somewhat, which was related in particular to their concerns about renewed rise in global commodity prices.",
        "While analysing developments in monetary aggregates, a few Council members pointed to the change in term structure of households’ assets.",
        "Primarily they stressed rising value of cash in circulation.",
        "Council members agreed that interest rates should be kept unchanged at the present meeting, and the current and expected economic situation spoke in favour of keeping interest rates unchanged at least until the end of 2013.",
        "In the opinion of the Council, further ahead the level of interest rates would depend on the scale and structure of recovery and the resulting inflationary pressure.",
        "A few Council members indicated that the future monetary policy should also take account of the expected fiscal policy.",
        "The Council decided to keep NBP’s interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 2.50%, the lombard rate at 4.00%, the deposit rate at 1.00%, and the rediscount rate at 2.75%.",
        "During the meeting, members of the Monetary Policy Council discussed the current and future monetary policy decisions against the background of macroeconomic developments in Poland and abroad.",
        "While addressing the external conditions it was pointed out that in 2013 Q1 the euro area had probably remained in recession and the outlook for recovery in this economy continued to be highly uncertain.",
        "In this context, Council members emphasised that in the recent period GDP forecasts for the euro area in 2013 had been revised downward, and economic indicators, after a certain improvement at the beginning of the year, deteriorated.",
        "Against this background attention was also drawn to weak business climate indicators in France.",
        "Yet, it was argued that in Germany, Poland’s main trading partner, business conditions in 2013 Q1 were better than in the entire euro area.",
        "Moreover, it was indicated that Germany was expected to see a certain acceleration in economic activity growth in 2013 and 2014, which might be related to rising domestic demand supported by high employment and low unemployment.",
        "Attention was also drawn to a relatively favourable outlook for demand in the United States and in Japan.",
        "Yet, concerns were expressed that economic growth in some advanced economies in the subsequent years would remain relatively low – in the opinion of a few Council members also due to large share of government expenditure in GDP.",
        "The Council members emphasised that strongly expansionary monetary policy pursued by major central banks, including the announcement of considerable quantitative easing by the Bank of Japan, might lead to intensified inflow of portfolio capital to the emerging economies, including Poland.",
        "As a result, those factors support Treasury bonds price increases, yet, in the longer term, might increase volatility of those prices and of the zloty exchange rate, in particular amidst sudden shift in risk aversion in the global markets.",
        "Yet, a few Council members remarked that the inflow of portfolio capital observed in the recent period had not been accompanied by any significant appreciation of the zloty.",
        "In turn, other Council members pointed out that recurring intensification of banking sector problems in some euro area economies might be a risk factor for Poland’s financial sector.",
        "While discussing the economic developments in Poland, Council members indicated that in 2013 Q1 economic activity had remained weak without signs of recovery.",
        "In this context, it was emphasised that industrial output in February had declined following its merely slight increase in January, whereas construction output growth continued to be negative.",
        "The Council members also pointed out that consumer demand had remained low, despite a certain improvement in consumer sentiment observed in the recent period, which was reflected in negative annual growth in retail sales in February 2013.",
        "According to the Council members, weak economic activity in Poland in 2013 Q1 was also suggested by weak business climate indicators, despite a certain improvement in some of those indicators in the recent period.",
        "Attention was also drawn to financial results of corporations which had deteriorated in 2012 Q4.",
        "At the same time, it was emphasised that financial condition of corporations exporting their output continued to be better than that of companies selling their goods in the domestic market.",
        "While analysing the situation in the labour market, lack of wage pressure was emphasised.",
        "Acceleration in annual growth in enterprise sector wages observed in February was probably driven 0 0-919 War szawa u l Święto krzys ka 1 1 /2 1 phon e (+4 8) 2 2 653 2 8 88  (+4 8) 2 2 653 1 3 28 by the statistical base effect and was one-off in nature.",
        "Some Council members observed that low demand in the economy contributed to a further rise in the unemployment rate, which, in their opinion, might have an adverse effect on human capital, and, consequently, the economy’s potential product.",
        "Yet, a few Council members expressed an opinion that the observed rise in the unemployment rate was largely the result of growing labour supply and adjustments in employment in enterprises, following the previously observed excessive employment growth.",
        "Those members argued that the labour market situation should improve with a rebound in production.",
        "The Council members also pointed to the structural features of the labour market, including its elasticity as regards employment contracts.",
        "A few of them argued that this elasticity favoured low labour remuneration which, on the one hand, helped enterprises to maintain their competitive advantage, but, on the other hand, had a negative impact on household savings and consumption.",
        "Yet, other Council members emphasised that weak geographical mobility of working population, resulting from poorly developed home rental market, was a considerable problem affecting the labour market.",
        "Members of the Council emphasised that weak economic activity was accompanied by a decline in corporate lending growth both as regards current and investment loans and a low growth in lending to households.",
        "A few Council members also pointed to falling value of new household deposits in February.",
        "Other Council members indicated, however, that despite interest rate decrease in the recent period – the annual growth in household deposits observed in February exceeded the January growth.",
        "While assessing the outlook for demand growth in Poland, the majority of the Council members believed that in the coming quarters GDP growth should accelerate, albeit would remain moderate.",
        "Slightly higher GDP growth would be, in the opinion of some Council members, the result of somewhat accelerating export growth driven by improving conditions in the German economy in the subsequent quarters.",
        "A few Council members also pointed out that declining inflation would stimulate purchasing power of consumer income which would, in turn, support domestic demand.",
        "Yet, some Council members were of the opinion that recovery in the Polish economy might be delayed, and the moment and scale of GDP growth acceleration were subject to uncertainty, especially given the uncertainty about recovery in the euro area.",
        "Other Council members, however, argued that GDP growth acceleration in the subsequent quarters might be stronger than indicated by the March projection of the NBP.",
        "With reference to inflationary processes, Council members highlighted the fact that the CPI index had decreased below the lower limit for deviations from the target – as well as the level envisaged in the March projection.",
        "In this context they pointed to a decline in all core inflation measures, confirming low demand pressure prevailing in the economy.",
        "Yet, a few Council members were of the opinion that the recently observed decline in inflation had largely been the result of supply shocks.",
        "Most Council members believed that CPI inflation would continue to run below the lower limit for deviations from the NBP inflation target, whereas core inflation would remain low and stable.",
        "However, some Council members pointed to factors that might drive future inflation higher than forecasted.",
        "It was pointed out that amidst low tax revenues, there was a significant likelihood of the VAT rate being kept at the elevated level into 2014, which would shift up the CPI inflation path for 2014 indicated by the March NBP projection.",
        "Yet, other Council members argued that higher-than-assumed VAT rate would curtail the purchasing power of households' income, thus limiting demand pressures in the economy.",
        "In addition, some Council members indicated short-term upward risks to prices, relating to the prolonged winter, which could contribute to increase in the prices of food and municipal services.",
        "A few Council members also observed that the current and forecast core inflation was running at levels which in the past had allowed to keep CPI inflation within the symmetrical tolerance band of deviations from the target.",
        "While discussing the level of the NBP interest rates it was agreed that these should be kept unchanged at the present meeting, in particular amidst ambiguous signs of a possible economic recovery in the subsequent quarters.",
        "At the same time, while addressing future decisions, some Council members were of the opinion that another interest rate cut in the coming months might be justified should there be no clear signs of rebound in the Polish economy, and should the likelihood of inflation persisting below the NBP target in the medium term rise.",
        "In the opinion of these Council members, an argument in favour of a further rate cut would be that real interest rates remained relatively high due to sharper than forecast inflation decline combined with decreasing inflation expectations, and the absence of clear signs of recovery in the Polish economy.",
        "At the same time, some Council members emphasised the fact that the relatively large interest rate disparity vis-a-vis advanced economies might fuel the inflow of portfolio capital to Poland, particularly in the environment of high liquidity in the global markets which received an additional boost from a marked increase in monetary expansion by the Bank of Japan.",
        "Some Council members believed, however, that the NBP interest rates should not be lowered further, as GDP growth was anticipated to accelerate in the subsequent quarters and CPI inflation in 2014 was likely to run above the level envisaged by the projection.",
        "A few of those Council members argued that further interest rate cuts might limit the scale of restructuring of unprofitable enterprises, hampering reallocation of resources towards more productive enterprises.",
        "At the same time, in their opinion, further NBP interest rate cuts would not support demand in the economy, as the current downturn was mainly caused by weak sentiment of economic agents and low external demand growth.",
        "These members also believed that interest rate cuts might lead to an excessive rise in Treasury bond prices, which could increase the macroeconomic risk in the event of a sudden outflow of capital in the future.",
        "Other Council members argued that keeping real interest rates at a relatively high level would stimulate deposit growth, thus supporting the stability of the banking sector, in particular amidst the uncertainty about the stability of the banking sector persisting in some euro area countries.",
        "The Council decided to keep the basic interest rates unchanged at the following levels: reference rate at 3.25%, lombard rate at 4.75%, deposit rate at 1.75%, rediscount rate at 3.50%.",
        "At its meeting, members of the Monetary Policy Council discussed the current and future monetary policy decisions in the context of the macroeconomic developments in Poland and abroad, and the November projection of inflation and GDP.",
        "While referring to economic activity abroad, it was indicated that in 2013 Q3 global economic conditions had improved somewhat.",
        "It was also pointed out that economic developments were diversified globally.",
        "In the emerging markets, economic growth has stayed low as for these economies.",
        "At the same time, growth is gradually accelerating in some developed countries, although downside risks to economic activity in the coming quarters persist.",
        "While discussing developments in the United States, it was highlighted that the recovery was building up there, most notably in the manufacturing industry and in the labour market.",
        "At the same time, it was noted that economic data for September 2013 had been slightly weaker than expected.",
        "At the same time, risk of weakening economic activity prevailed due to uncertainty about future fiscal policy in the country and the temporary suspension of the activities of the federal government in October.",
        "While discussing the economic developments in the euro area, it was pointed out that quarterly GDP growth in 2013 Q3 had probably remained positive.",
        "However, a few Council members noted that the economic recovery might not be sustainable in some euro area countries due to the persistence of risks in the banking sector in these countries.",
        "During the discussion the opinion was also expressed that – amid declining inflation in the euro area – the likelihood of further monetary policy easing by the European Central Bank had risen.",
        "It was also noted that GDP growth in China had accelerated slightly in 2013 Q3.",
        "At the same time, it was highlighted that GDP growth had remained relatively low as for this country.",
        "A few Council members indicated that the persistently weak activity in major emerging market economies was due to both relatively weak economic growth in developed countries as well as relatively low domestic demand growth in emerging market economies.",
        "While analysing developments in financial markets, some Council members indicated that the increase in risk aversion in 2013 Q2 and Q3 contributed – as in the case of other emerging economies – to a decline in non-resident holdings of Polish sovereign bonds and a depreciation of the zloty.",
        "It was pointed out, however, that the Polish currency had depreciated less than many emerging market currencies.",
        "Furthermore, it was emphasized that since August the zloty had appreciated.",
        "It was observed that relative stability of the zloty might have been, in particular, due to a reduction in Poland’s external imbalance in recent quarters.",
        "At the same time, the gradual decline in the non-resident holdings of Polish sovereign bonds has been reducing the risks associated with debt financing by foreign capital.",
        "While discussing the current economic developments in Poland, Council members pointed out that the data on domestic economic activity released since the previous meeting had shown further recovery, particularly in the industrial sector.",
        "It was however highlighted that some of the data had turned out to be weaker than anticipated, and the acceleration in output growth had so far lagged behind the rise in leading indicators.",
        "It was also pointed out that the main factor behind increase in activity had been external demand growth, while domestic demand growth had stayed limited.",
        "Some Council members pointed to the ongoing stagnation in the labour market, including the persistently elevated unemployment.",
        "This has not, so far, been mitigated by the slight increase in employment observed in the corporate sector in recent months.",
        "Stagnation in the labour market leads to weak growth in wages, which reduces the cost and demand pressures in the economy.",
        "Referring to the economic outlook, Council members pointed out that – in the light of the November projection – GDP growth was likely to continue to accelerate.",
        "Nonetheless, economic recovery will be still moderate, and thus the output gap will stay negative in the entire projection horizon.",
        "Some Council members pointed out that acceleration in GDP growth in the coming quarters should be driven by a recovery in domestic demand, especially investment, which would be supported by the inflow of EU funds under the new budget perspective.",
        "A few Council members pointed out, however, that slow growth in corporate lending might curb private sector investment growth.",
        "Referring to the inflation projection, Council members emphasized that the projected inflation returned to the band for deviations from the inflation target in the projection horizon, but posed no threat to meeting inflation target in the medium term.",
        "Apart from weak demand pressure, low inflation – in light of the projection – should also be supported by weak pressure on global commodity prices.",
        "A few Council members pointed out that since the zloty might appreciate amid improvement in the domestic economic conditions, substitution of domestic goods with imported ones might prove to be another factor conducive to lower inflation.",
        "According to a few Council members, inflation may rise above the projection, should demand pressure prove stronger than assumed in the projection, or should negative shocks occur in the commodity markets.",
        "Moreover, according to these members, the temporary inflation increase anticipated in the projection in 2014 Q2 could – if translated into higher inflation expectations – result in some reduction in the real interest rate.",
        "It was also noted that an upside risk to global inflation continued to be posed by highly expansionary monetary policy of the major central banks.",
        "Council members agreed that interest rates should remain unchanged at the current meeting.",
        "It was pointed out that the reduction in interest rates in the first half of 2013 and their stabilization in the second half of the year supported the recovery of the domestic economy, return of inflation to the target and stabilisation in the financial markets.",
        "The Council assessed that in spite of the expected acceleration of economic growth, GDP growth in the coming years (i.e.",
        "in the projection horizon) would remain moderate, and the risk of a substantial increase in domestic inflationary pressure, which would pose a threat to meeting the inflation target in the medium term, was limited.",
        "This assessment was also supported by the November projection of inflation and GDP.",
        "Therefore, the Council decided that it would be justified to maintain interest rates at current levels at least until the end of the first half of 2014.",
        "The Council kept the NBP’s interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 2.50%, the lombard rate at 4.00%, the deposit rate at 1.00% and the rediscount rate to 2.75%.",
        "At its meeting, the Monetary Policy Council discussed the current and future monetary policy decisions against the background of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions.",
        "While analysing the external conditions, it was emphasised that the global economic activity remained weak as suggested, in particular, by lower GDP growth in the United States in 2012 Q4 and persisting recession in the euro area.",
        "At the same time, attention was paid to a slight improvement in some economic indicators in major developed economies.",
        "Some Council members stressed that factors contributing to volatility of sentiment in the financial markets as well as sentiment of households and corporations had not come to an end.",
        "While analysing the outlook for external business conditions, a few Council members pointed to a further downward revision in the outlook for GDP growth in 2013 in countries being Poland’s main trading partners, i.e.",
        "the euro area countries, including Germany.",
        "Other Council members pointed out that although the global economic activity would probably remain relatively low in the coming quarters, it was expected to show a gradual improvement in the second half of 2013.",
        "Considering the significant role of net exports in domestic GDP growth in the recent quarters, some Council members assessed that external economic developments in 2013 might have a stronger impact on economic activity in Poland than during the 2009 slowdown.",
        "While analysing the data on economic growth in Poland in 2012 Q4 (implied from the 2012 preliminary GDP estimate), Council members pointed to a further weakening of domestic demand, driven, in particular, by lower consumption demand and further decline in investment.",
        "At the same time, some Council members stressed that during the previously observed periods of economic downturn, consumption had always been a factor supporting economic growth and thus the currently observed weakening in consumption might signal stronger weakening in domestic demand in the coming quarters, especially considering the unfavourable outlook for corporate investment and poor prospects for public investment growth.",
        "Other Council members assessed that the fundamentals of the Polish economy are still sound which was suggested by the absence of any major macroeconomic imbalances.",
        "Moreover, a few Council members argued that according to the currently available short-term forecasts, some GDP growth acceleration could be expected in the coming quarters.",
        "When referring to consumption decline, some Council members pointed out that it was largely driven by worsening situation in the labour market, including low wage growth and intensified concerns about job loss amidst heightened unemployment.",
        "Declining consumption was also partly related to the deceleration in lending to households.",
        "A few Council members argued that low credit to GDP ratio in Poland as compared to other EU Member States suggested that the role of lending in supporting consumer demand was limited.",
        "At the same time, they pointed out that in the Central and Eastern European countries, where inflow of domestic savings to the banking system had been limited, diminished role of foreign capital as a source of lending had translated into deeper deceleration in credit growth.",
        "Those Council members indicated that in 2012 the growth in households’ bank deposits in Poland had run considerably below its 2011 level which might have affected banks’ lending policy.",
        "Some Council members assessed that supervisory measures and shrinking demand for lending from the private sector might have been of more importance for the lending volume.",
        "While discussing developments in households’ deposits in 2012, some Council members pointed out that although their lower growth had been, to certain extent, driven by larger inflows of capital to investment funds, this was also indicative of households’ lower propensity to save especially amidst cuts in interest rates on deposits at the end of 2012.",
        "Other Council members were of the opinion that households’ propensity to save was currently more determined by business conditions, with low propensity to save being typical of an economic slowdown, while interest rates on deposits had rather a limited impact.",
        "Referring to investment activity, some Council members assessed that there were no signs that could point to any considerable growth in corporate investment which, combined with falling public investment, might translate into continued decline in this component of domestic demand.",
        "Yet, a few Council members emphasised that the decline in investment observed in 2012 Q4 was slightly weaker than in 2012 Q3 and according to available short-term forecasts, also in 2013 investment growth, although likely to remain negative, would be on the rise.",
        "Council members also discussed the impact of fiscal policy on economic activity in 2013.",
        "Some Council members pointed out that further decline in public investment would dampen economic growth in the short term.",
        "Other Council members indicated, however, that the decline in public investment would be accompanied by growth in public consumption (also due to automatic stabilizers), and consequently, fiscal policy would not be a factor considerably dampening GDP growth.",
        "While analysing inflation developments, the Council members pointed to further decline in CPI inflation which went down to 2.4% in December 2012, i.e.",
        "to the level consistent with the NBP inflation target of 2.5%.",
        "Also core inflation measures continued on a downward trend and the producer price index remained negative which, in the Council’s opinion, was indicative of lack of wage and cost pressure in the economy.",
        "Decreasing inflation was accompanied by declining household inflation expectations.",
        "Some Council members pointed out that in the coming months inflation might decline to a level close to the lower limit of deviations from the inflation target and, considering that economic activity may continue to be weak in the coming quarters, there was a risk of inflation remaining below the target in the medium term.",
        "Other Council members stressed that the currently observed decline in inflation was largely the result of falling growth in energy and food prices which hit one of the lowest levels in years.",
        "Those Council members argued that particularly in the case of energy prices affected by global commodity prices, the decline might be a temporary phenomenon.",
        "While discussing the NBP interest rates, the majority of the Council members assessed, as at previous meetings, that at the current meeting the NBP interest rates should continue to be lowered, which should support economic activity and consequently reduce the risk of inflation remaining below the target in the medium term.",
        "Yet, those Council members differed in their opinions as to the scale of cuts in the NBP interest rates, both at the current meeting and during the entire current cycle.",
        "As at the January meeting, the majority of the Council members assessed that the incoming data – confirming the previously anticipated decline in inflation and significant economic slowdown – did not justify a greater scale of cuts in the NBP interest rates at the current meeting.",
        "In the opinion of a few Council members, concerns that too sharp decrease in interest rate could further undermine propensity to save in the banking sector speaks for maintaining the current scale of interest rate cuts.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members, as there was a risk of inflation running below the NBP inflation target already in the coming quarters, the NBP interest rates should be lowered more – or even far more – at the current meeting.",
        "Those members pointed out that in particular the length of lags in the transmission mechanism would justify a relatively prompt monetary policy easing.",
        "Those Council members stressed also the relatively high level of real interest rates in Poland in comparison with the major developed economies.",
        "Yet, a few Council members assessed that the current interest rate level was relatively low as compared to the previous periods of economic downturns and further monetary policy easing was not justified.",
        "Those members also argued that excessive interest rate cuts would be a factor lowering the incentives to strengthen supply side of the Polish economy, which considering the depth of the current adjustments in some EU countries, including adjustments related to unit labour costs, would have an adverse consequences for GDP growth in the longer run.",
        "While referring to future decisions, the majority of the Council members was of the opinion that the assessment whether it was justified to continue monetary policy easing would depend on the analysis of the incoming data on economic developments and inflationary pressure, including the results of the March macroeconomic projection of the NBP.",
        "A few Council members indicated that considering the already implemented monetary policy easing as well as expected gradual improvement in business conditions in the second half of 2013, the current cycle of NBP interest rate cuts might be approaching a pause or an end.",
        "At the meeting, a motion was submitted to lower the NBP basic interest rate by 1.0 percentage point.",
        "The motion did not pass.",
        "A motion was also submitted to lower the NBP basic interest rate by 0.5 percentage points.",
        "The motion did not pass.",
        "At the meeting, a motion was also submitted to lower the NBP basic interest rate by 0.25 percentage points.",
        "The Council decided to decrease the NBP basic interest rates by 0.25 percentage points to the following levels: reference rate to 3.75%, lombard rate to 5.25%, deposit rate to 2.25% and rediscount rate to 4.00%.",
        "At its meeting, the Monetary Policy Council discussed the current and future monetary policy decisions against the background of the domestic and external macroeconomic conditions.",
        "While analysing the external conditions, it was pointed out that the global economic conditions remained weak.",
        "Yet, the uncertainty about the short-term global economic outlook had abated, mainly due to a partial agreement on the scale of fiscal tightening in 2013 in the US, development of institutional reforms in the euro area and further monetary policy easing by main central banks.",
        "These factors had also contributed to an improvement in financial market sentiment.",
        "At the same time, attention was drawn to protracted recession and continued fiscal tightening in a majority of the euro area member states.",
        "It was also indicated that the attempts to reduce general government sector imbalances might curb GDP growth and trigger a further rise in the unemployment rate in some euro area countries in the short term.",
        "A few members of the Council argued, however, that in 2013 Germany, Poland’s main trading partner, was likely to experience higher GDP growth compared with other euro area countries.",
        "Yet, other Council members judged that although some improvement in the global economic conditions might be expected in the coming quarters, economic growth abroad would remain relatively weak.",
        "While addressing economic conditions in Poland, the Council members agreed that the incoming data confirmed further weakening in economic activity in 2012 Q4.",
        "It was emphasised that the slowdown was driven by both external and internal factors.",
        "It was pointed out that the economic growth in 2012 Q4 was most probably below the November projection.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members, the incoming data, including retail sales data, suggested that the consumption growth could be close to zero in 2012 Q4.",
        "While analysing factors behind a slowdown in consumption growth, the Council members pointed to a decline in real disposable income, driven, in particular, by deteriorating labour market conditions.",
        "It was emphasised that the slowdown in consumer spending growth was accompanied with a decline in the savings rate to its historical low.",
        "While addressing investment activity, the opinion was expressed that investment growth had probably remained negative in 2012 Q4.",
        "Attention was drawn to considerable cuts in public investment expenditure, in particular of local governments, at the end of 2012, related to the necessity of reduction in fiscal imbalances.",
        "As regards corporate investment, a few Council members pointed out that in the previous years, strong investment growth had been supported by excessively optimistic sentiment in corporate sector and EU funds inflow.",
        "While discussing the recent developments in the banking sector, a few Council members pointed to still tight lending conditions and slowing deposit growth.",
        "Against this background, they also indicated that, following interest rate cuts by the NBP at the previous Council meetings, the interest on deposits fell significantly stronger compared with the interest on loans.",
        "While addressing the Polish economic outlook, the Council members pointed out that GDP growth would stay low in the coming quarters.",
        "Consumption would be still adversely affected with slow growth in disposable income of households, driven by the deteriorating labour market conditions, and a higher effective personal income tax rate as of 2013.",
        "As regards the labour market conditions, some Council members expected further deterioration, which would be likely reflected in a further rise in the unemployment rate.",
        "A few Council members pointed out that the rise in the disability pension contribution in 2012 and a relatively high relation between the minimum and the average wage might dampen the labour demand.",
        "Moreover, consumption will be adversely affected with limited room for a further decline in savings rate.",
        "While analysing the investment outlook, the Council members assessed that, in particular, a further decline in the estimated value of newly launched investment projects suggested that the investment growth would stay negative in the coming quarters.",
        "It was pointed out that a decline in investments of central government and of local governments co-financed with the EU funds would also be conducive to a fall in investment expenditure.",
        "At the same time, it was assessed that economic growth would further be supported mainly by net exports.",
        "Therefore, demand prospects in the euro area posed a risk to Polish economic outlook.",
        "Some Council members were of the opinion that economic growth in Poland might increase along with the likely rebound in economic activity abroad in the second half of 2013.",
        "While addressing inflation developments in the Polish economy, the Council members pointed out that the CPI inflation had declined notably in recent months and had been close to the NBP target in November.",
        "It was emphasised that the decline in CPI inflation had been largely driven by slower growth in the commodity prices, including food and energy, which previously had contributed to faster price growth.",
        "Core inflation had also declined, indicating no demand pressure.",
        "Against this background, attention was paid to a downward revision in inflation expectations of both households and corporates.",
        "At the same time, the majority of the Council members believed that in the coming months inflation would decline further and then stabilize below the inflation target for at least one year.",
        "In the opinion of the Council members, the decline in inflation would be driven by both decreases in energy prices as of January 2013, negative output gap and lack of wage pressure in the economy.",
        "At the same time, some Council members pointed at uncertainty about inflation developments in the longer term.",
        "This uncertainty was driven, in particular, by possible considerable changes in commodity prices in the global markets as well as in utility prices.",
        "Moreover, a few Council members pointed out that although in 2013 a further decline in core inflation could be expected, it would probably stay elevated considering this business cycle stage.",
        "While discussing the NBP interest rates, as at previous meetings, it was assessed that at the current meeting the NBP interest rates should continue to be lowered, which should support economic activity and reduce the risk of inflation falling below the target in the medium term.",
        "Yet, the Council members differed in their opinion as to the scale of cuts in NBP interest rate, both at the present meeting and during the entire cycle.",
        "The majority of the Council members indicated that the incoming data – confirming the previously anticipated decline in inflation and protracted economic slowdown – did not justify a greater scale of cuts in the NBP interest rates at the current meeting.",
        "In the opinion of these Council members, also the risks related to growth in prices, in particular for commodities, advocated for maintaining the current scale of interest rate cuts.",
        "A few Council members also indicated that a sharp decrease in interest rates might lead to further decline in the propensity to save.",
        "On the other hand, in the opinion of a few Council members, as the inflation was likely to stay below the NBP inflation target in the coming quarters, the NBP interest rates should be lowered more – or even far more – at the current meeting.",
        "These members pointed out that in particular the length of lags in the transmission mechanism would justify a relatively prompt monetary policy easing.",
        "While referring to future decisions, the majority of the Council members did not rule out further monetary policy easing, should the incoming data, including the 2012 GDP data, confirm a protracted economic slowdown and should the risk of increase in inflationary pressure remain limited.",
        "In turn, other Council members declared that the already effected interest rate cuts were sufficient to limit the risk of inflation running significantly below the target in the medium term, and that the impact of potential further cuts in the NBP rates on economic activity would be small.",
        "At the same time, in the opinion of a few of these Council members, further monetary policy easing could, in the longer term, trigger a growth in imbalances in the Polish economy.",
        "At the meeting, a motion was submitted to lower the NBP basic interest rates by 1.25 percentage points.",
        "The motion did not pass.",
        "A motion was also submitted to lower the NBP basic interest rates by 0.50 percentage points.",
        "The motion did not pass.",
        "At the meeting, a motion was also submitted to lower the NBP basic interest rates by 0.25 percentage points.",
        "The Council decided to decrease the NBP basic interest rates by 0.25 percentage points to the following levels: reference rate to 4.00%, lombard rate to 5.50%, deposit rate to 2.50% and rediscount rate to 4.25%.",
        "At its meeting, members of the Monetary Policy Council discussed the current and future monetary policy decisions in the context of macroeconomic developments in Poland and abroad.",
        "While assessing the conditions in the external environment of the Polish economy it was noted that data on the euro area GDP in 2013 Q1 had proven to be weaker than expected and confirmed continuing recession in the euro area.",
        "Some members of the Council pointed to the fact that although business condition indicators for the euro area had improved somewhat, as observed in the recent period, they continued to suggest persisting recessionary trends in that economy, further delaying the prospects for economic recovery.",
        "Factor having an adverse effect on economic activity in the euro area – according to those members of the Council – was the on-going process of deleveraging in the private sector and tightening of the fiscal policy.",
        "This translated, in particular, into further deterioration of the labour market situation in many countries, which, combined with unresolved capital shortfall of some euro area banks, hampered growth of the euro area economy.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that GDP growth in the United States accelerated in 2013 Q1.",
        "An important factor supporting activity in the U.S. economy was revival of consumption, observed amidst gradually declining unemployment.",
        "Some members of the Council pointed out that, in the opinion of market participants, improving situation in the labour market and continued economic recovery might urge the Federal Reserve to limit the scale of asset purchases over the next few quarters.",
        "The signs of a possible reduction of monetary policy expansiveness by the Fed had strongly effected the sentiment in the global financial markets.",
        "Consequently, the emerging markets, including Poland, saw some outflow of its portfolio capital, which was reflected in the weakening of the zloty exchange rate and rising yields on Polish bonds.",
        "While addressing domestic economic activity in early 2013, it was indicated that GDP growth in the first quarter was significantly weaker than expected.",
        "It was also stressed that although investment decline had slowed down somewhat, domestic demand continued to decline amidst stagnation in consumption.",
        "Moreover, lower contribution of net exports to GDP growth confirmed that low activity abroad, in particular, the recession in the euro area, was adversely affecting the Polish economy.",
        "It was also emphasized that the monthly macroeconomic data (stagnation of industrial output and retail sales and further decline in construction output in April) signalled continued weak economic activity at the beginning of 2013 Q2.",
        "Some members of the Council assessed that also the coming quarters might be expected to see persistently low economic activity in Poland, and that recovery might start later than previously assumed.",
        "In their opinion, economic activity would continue to be negatively affected by deteriorating situation in the labour market, low credit growth and on-going fiscal tightening (including the decline in public investment).",
        "Economic growth would further be curbed – in the opinion of those Council members – by the lack of a significant recovery in the euro area.",
        "Other members of the Council assessed, however, that subsequent quarters might be expected to bring gradual recovery in economic growth.",
        "In this context, they pointed to positive signals from the national accounts data, i.e.",
        "a less steep investment decline in 2013 Q1 and acceleration in GDP growth, added value and exports in quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted terms.",
        "Moreover, in their  opinion, the approaching economic recovery might be suggested by the improvement in some business condition indicators, halting the decline in the number of new orders in industry and accelerating growth in monetary aggregates observed at the beginning of Q2.",
        "While analysing inflation developments it was pointed out that April 2013 saw another decline in inflation (to 0.8%), which remained markedly below the NBP inflation target.",
        "Some members of the Council emphasized that the fall in inflation in the past few months has been stronger than expected in the March projection, and that some of the latest short-term forecasts indicated possible further decline in inflation in subsequent months and its remaining below the lower limit for deviations from the NBP target over the coming year.",
        "When discussing inflationary processes, the steepening fall in producer prices (PPI) and continued lack of wage pressure were also noted.",
        "According to the majority of the Council members, when taking into account the lack of cost and wage pressures and weak growth prospects, the risk of inflation running below target in the medium term was still greater than the risk of inflation exceeding the target, despite the monetary policy easing implemented so far and some depreciation of zloty exchange rate observed recently.",
        "A few members of the Council emphasized, however, that inflation could return to the NBP target within a few quarters, as suggested by forecasts of financial analysts and Assumptions for 2014 budget law adopted by the Ministry of Finance.",
        "While addressing the situation in the labour market, a few members of the Council pointed out that although wage growth remained slow, the lowest wages were rising faster than the average ones, which was due to the currently implemented and planned increases of the minimum wage.",
        "This contributed to rising unemployment among the young and the low-skilled workers.",
        "A few members of the Council argued, however, that an excessively low minimum wage would discourage labour participation, and the current ratio of minimum wage to average wage did not seem high.",
        "While analysing the situation in the banking sector, a few members of the Council pointed out that the recently implemented monetary policy easing had so far not contributed to a revival in lending, which – in their opinion – showed that further interest rate cuts offered only limited potential to boost economic activity.",
        "At the same time, those Council members pointed out that falling interest on term deposits, driven by NBP interest rate cuts, discouraged households from this form of saving; whereas term deposits are a relatively stable source of bank financing.",
        "Yet, other members of the Council emphasized, that the NBP interest rate cuts had been vastly passed through into interest rates on bank loans and deposits.",
        "They also stressed that as monetary policy transmission mechanism was characterised by considerable time lags, interest rate cuts should not be expected to translate immediately into lending and economic growth.",
        "In turn, as regards reduced volume of term deposits, those Council members indicated that withdrawn funds were transferred to current and savings accounts, and therefore only maturity structure of banks’ liabilities changes.",
        "In assessing the current interest rate level, some members of the Council emphasized that the scale of the monetary policy easing implemented so far was significant, and the NBP interest rates were currently low.",
        "According to a few Council members, excessively low interest rates might bring negative effects, namely: undermine the incentives for corporate restructuring, change the structure of bank lending (increase role of mortgage loans, while limiting lending to corporates), spur unprofitable in the long-term investment projects, and lead to asset price bubbles.",
        "Those members of the Council also pointed out that some of those factors might translate into lower potential growth.",
        "Other members of the Council argued that corporate restructuring was hampered to a much larger extent by institutional and legal factors, and given banks’ current attitude to lending, the risk of financing unprofitable investment was not high enough to justify keeping interest rates at – what they assessed to be – an excessively high level.",
        "Moreover, in the opinion of those Council members, declining current and forecasted inflation was increasing real interest rates above the level adequate to the current macroeconomic conditions.",
        "At the same time, as regards the risk of decreasing potential output growth, a few Council members pointed out that it might also be driven by a prolonged economic downturn, which, causing heightened unemployment might have a lasting negative impact on human capital and increase the level of equilibrium unemployment.",
        "While discussing the level of the NBP interest rates, the majority of Council members assessed that they should be lowered at the current meeting.",
        "However, their opinions differed as to the scale of the decrease.",
        "In turn, other Council members were of the opinion that the interest rates should be kept unchanged.",
        "When discussing the NBP interest rate decision, the majority of the Council members pointed out that the incoming data confirmed stronger – than expected in March – economic slowdown in Poland and abroad, and a deeper than anticipated decline in inflation.",
        "Given the above and considering the uncertainty about the scale and timing of economic recovery in the euro area and the risk of prolonged period of weak economic activity in Poland, the scale of monetary policy easing should be expanded.",
        "Further interest rate cuts would support recovery in the Polish economy, and thus the return of inflation to the NBP target in the medium term.",
        "At the same time, some of those Council members assessed that the scale of interest rate cuts at the June meeting should be moderate in order to reduce their negative impact on households’ propensity to save in the banking sector.",
        "In the context of the decision about the scale of interest rate cuts, those Council members also pointed to the issue of interest rate differential between Poland and major developed economies, which may be important for portfolio capital flows.",
        "Some Council members argued, however, that due to time lags in the monetary transmission mechanism, the monetary policy easing should be more decisive and the scale of interest rate cuts in June larger.",
        "Other members of the Council assessed that the coming quarters should be expected to bring a gradual recovery in economic activity and a rise in inflation over the coming year (partly due to statistical base effect), which justified keeping the NBP interest rates unchanged.",
        "At the same time, expectations that the Federal Reserve would reduce the scale of quantitative easing could translate into the risk of increased capital outflows from the emerging markets, which – in the opinion of those Council members – also spoke in favour of keeping the NBP interest rates unchanged.",
        "At the same time, in the opinion of the majority of the Council members, given the significant scale of the already implemented cuts in the NBP interest rates, the current cycle of monetary easing was coming closer to an end.",
        "The Council members pointed out that a more comprehensive assessment of the medium-term outlook for economic growth and inflation – allowing the discussion on the monetary policy stance in the coming months – would be possible in July, after the Council had got acquainted with the new NBP projection and information about a possible amendment to the budget law.",
        "At the meeting, a motion was submitted to lower the NBP basic interest rates by 0.50 percentage points.",
        "The motion did not pass.",
        "A motion was also submitted to lower the NBP basic interest rates by 0.25 percentage points.",
        "The Council decided to lower the NBP basic interest rates by 0.25 percentage points to the following levels: reference rate to 2.75%, lombard rate to 4.25%, deposit rate to 1.25%, rediscount rate to 3.00%.",
        "At its meeting, members of the Monetary Policy Council discussed the current and future monetary policy decisions in the context of macroeconomic developments in Poland and abroad.",
        "While referring to economic conditions abroad, Council members drew attention, on the one hand, to a gradual economic recovery in the United States and in the euro area, and, on the other hand, to a certain weakening of economic activity in the major emerging markets.",
        "At the same time, according to a few Council members, looking ahead, global economic growth might be supported in particular by recovery in the developed economies, as without institutional reforms, a number of emerging economies would not be able to grow at the rate observed so far.",
        "Yet, other Council members argued that GDP growth in such countries as China would be driven by low – comparing to productivity – labour cost for still a long time to come.",
        "With reference to the United States it was emphasized that GDP growth had accelerated in that economy in 2013 Q2, as well as that the incoming monthly data for Q3 pointed to a further improvement in business sentiments and declining unemployment rate, which should support the recovery also in the second half of the year.",
        "It was emphasized that forecasts indicated a further slight increase in GDP growth in the American economy in 2014.",
        "Some Council members believed, however, that the anticipated phasing out of the Federal Reserve from the quantitative easing programmes might put the US recovery into question as the increase in interest on mortgage loans might curb the real estate market revival.",
        "While discussing economic climate in the euro area it was emphasized that whereas GDP growth in that economy remained negative in annual terms, it grew in quarterly terms in 2013 Q2.",
        "It was pointed out that economic growth accelerated in particular in Germany – Poland’s main trading partner – and the decline in GDP continued to slow down both in Italy and in Spain.",
        "Attention was also paid to the continuous improvement in business climate indicators in the euro area in Q3 signaling further recovery in the euro area economy.",
        "A few Council members also emphasized the decreasing external imbalances in some euro area countries as to a factor having a positive effect on the economic prospects of that economy.",
        "Some Council members assessed, however, that the subsequent quarters would most likely see a gradual recovery and GDP growth in the euro area would be markedly lower than in the United States.",
        "Those Council members viewed the persistently high debt in both public and private sector, low competitiveness of the economy, high unemployment rate and restrictive lending policies of commercial banks as inhibitors of economic growth in some euro area countries.",
        "Moreover, a few Council members assessed that the incomplete restructuring of the banking sector posed additional risk to recovery in some euro area countries.",
        "Some Council members pointed out that the recent hikes in global oil prices might contribute to higher inflation worldwide.",
        "Meanwhile, other members of the Council emphasized that recently observed hikes in oil prices reflected political tensions stemming form the civil war in Syria, whereas a slowdown in global demand growth, primarily attributed to lower growth in activity in major emerging economies, had a dampening effect on oil prices.",
        "In effect – as argued by those Council members – oil price hikes might prove to be a temporary phenomenon.",
        "At the same time, a few Council members pointed out that hikes in commodity prices might be supported by a certain recovery in the advanced economies.",
        "While assessing the global economic situation, Council members also pointed to the fact that the Federal Reserve had announced its intention to limit the scale of quantitative easing.",
        "As a result, in the recent months the capital had fled from the emerging economies and most of their currencies had suffered a marked depreciation.",
        "It was assessed that the Federal Reserve’s withdrawal would most likely remain the source of tensions in the global financial market also in the quarters to come.",
        "While examining the impact of tensions in the global financial markets on the Polish economy, the Council members noted a significant growth in yields on Polish bonds, following their previous considerable decline, as well as change in the share of nonresidents holdings.",
        "At the same time, a few Council members assessed that there was persistently high – in their opinion – risk of global economic shocks, likely to cause fluctuations in yields on Polish bonds.",
        "In that context it was also indicated that most of the government’s borrowing requirements for 2013 had already been met.",
        "This moderates the impact of higher secondary market bond yields on debt servicing costs.",
        "Some Council members also declared that the increase in yields in the secondary market did not have to translate, in its entirety, into a rise in yields in the primary market.",
        "At the same time, it was stressed that mounting tensions in the global financial markets had not contributed to a considerable – as compared to the exchange rates of other currencies of the emerging markets – depreciation of the zloty.",
        "In the opinion of the Council members this primarily reflected the lack of significant imbalances in the Polish economy and a positive current account balance.",
        "While addressing the situation in the real sphere of the Polish economy, the Council members pointed out that 2013 Q2 had seen a certain acceleration in GDP growth, this resulting however from higher contribution of net exports to GDP growth, coupled with steeper decline in domestic demand.",
        "It was noticed that the recently incoming monthly data indicated the continuation of economic recovery in 2013 Q3.",
        "While discussing the economic outlook for Poland, Council members agreed that the subsequent quarters would see further improvement in business conditions, yet they differed as to scale of the anticipated economic recovery.",
        "Some Council members believed that economic activity would be accelerating slowly, and that the nearest quarters would see GDP growth below its potential level.",
        "At the same time, a few Council members anticipated that the economic recovery would be relatively rapid, and, in effect, the negative output gap would start to close gradually.",
        "The scale of further fiscal tightening was also indicated as a factor increasing uncertainty about GDP growth in 2014.",
        "Members of the Council who expect moderate recovery in the economy, pointed to the deepening decline in investment and stagnation in private consumption in 2013 Q2.",
        "Some Council members underlined, however, that decline in investment is typical of the current phase of the business cycle.",
        "A few Council members also noted that GDP growth in the coming quarters might be negatively affected by the situation in the banking sector, which, on the one hand, had posted a weaker growth in household deposits, and, on the other hand, rising share of non-performing loans.",
        "They also drew attention to decrease in loans to enterprises growth.",
        "Members of the Council expecting somewhat faster GDP growth in the coming quarters, however, pointed to rising retail sales and industrial production and weakening decline in construction in the recent months, as well as signs of a possible rebound in investment over the subsequent quarters (rise in the estimated cost and number of newly started investment).",
        "According to those Council members, further economic recovery will be driven by a growth in disposable income of households and improved performance of corporates, including a rise in their liquidity.",
        "During the discussion attention was paid to the signs of labour market stabilization.",
        "In particular, it was noted that although employment in the economy in 2013 Q2, was falling in annual terms, the incoming data from the corporate sector showed slight increases in month-over-month employment.",
        "A few Council members argued, however, that despite the economic recovery no significant increase in employment should be expected as during the slowdown enterprises strove to limit layoffs.",
        "Council members also pointed out that despite a certain wage growth recorded in 2013 Q2, growth in unit labour costs remained stable due to a concurrent growth in labour productivity.",
        "Council members emphasized that persistently heightened unemployment rate was a factor limiting wage growth.",
        "A few Council members argued, however, that the strikes announced for the coming months might put further upward pressure on wages in the economy.",
        "While discussing inflation developments, Council members emphasized that despite a significant rise in July, inflation continued to run below the lower limit for deviations from the target.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that the rise in inflation recorded in July resulted from increased waste disposal fees, changes in the seasonal pattern of potato prices as well as higher fuel prices, and therefore did not signal the emergence of demand pressures.",
        "Most of the Council members assessed that inflation was likely to remain below the target in the coming quarters due to the lack of demand pressure.",
        "Some Council members pointed to the fact that base effect related to a significant rise in inflation in July 2013 would exert a downward pressure on inflation in the second half of 2014.",
        "Other members believed that even though inflation was likely to remain below the target, the increase in oil prices posted in the recent period and the previously observed moderate depreciation of the zloty could be driving inflation up.",
        "A few Council members in turn were of the opinion that as it was possible for GDP growth to rebound faster (above potential output growth) the subsequent quarters might see demand pressure, which would be an additional factor contributing to inflation acceleration.",
        "In the context of the expected rise in inflation, a few Council members emphasized that higher inflation supported lower real interest rates.",
        "Other Council members, however, pointed out that the medium-term inflation forecasts of economists and bank analysts – despite fluctuations in inflation – remained relatively stable, which currently stabilized the ex-ante real interest rate.",
        "Council members agreed that interest rates should be kept unchanged at the present meeting, and the current and expected economic situation spoke in favour of keeping interest rates unchanged until the end of 2013.",
        "In the opinion of the Council, further ahead the level of interest rates would depend on the scale and structure of recovery and the resulting inflationary pressure.",
        "The Council decided to keep NBP’s interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 2.50%, the lombard rate at 4.00%, the deposit rate at 1.00% and the rediscount rate at 2.75%.",
        "At its meeting, members of the Monetary Policy Council discussed the current and future monetary policy decisions in the context of the macroeconomic situation in Poland and abroad.",
        "Referring to external conditions, it was emphasized that signs of renewed weakening in the global economic conditions had appeared in recent months.",
        "It was indicated that in Q1 GDP growth in the United States had been lower than expected by market participants and the sentiment of the local economic agents had deteriorated.",
        "It was further argued that continued measures to reduce the general government sector imbalances in the United States might contain the economic growth in the coming quarters.",
        "Meanwhile, the euro area is likely to have remained in recession and a renewed deterioration in leading indicators in most of its member states, including Germany, may imply that the economic recovery may be delayed.",
        "A few Council members indicated at the same time that, according to external forecasts, economic conditions in Germany, the main trading partner of Poland, were set to improve gradually in the second half of the year.",
        "Referring to the recent data on economic activity abroad, it was also pointed out that the deteriorating economic conditions in developed countries translated into weaker growth in major emerging market economies.",
        "While discussing price developments abroad, it was noted that inflation had declined in many economies, including the euro area.",
        "A few Council members emphasized, however, that core inflation in the euro area had remained stable, whereas lower price growth in the region, as in other economies, had largely resulted from a decrease in commodity prices, including food and energy, observed in recent months.",
        "While referring to the monetary policy of the major central banks, it was highlighted that the European Central Bank had decreased interest rates in May, which had led to an increase in the spread between the interest rates in Poland and the euro area.",
        "Council members emphasized that highly expansionary monetary policy of major central banks may continue to contribute to stronger portfolio capital inflows to emerging economies, including Poland.",
        "This contributes to a rise in sovereign bond prices.",
        "However, this can lead to an increase in the volatility of sovereign bond prices over time, in particular amid rapid changes in risk aversion in global markets.",
        "While discussing the recent data on the Polish economy, Council members pointed out that estimate of GDP in 2012 Q4, including investment expenditure, had been revised down.",
        "It was assessed that in 2013 Q1 economic growth had probably remained low, as indicated by a decline in industrial and construction output and real retail sales growth, which had been close to zero.",
        "Council members also emphasized that economic indicators in April – after a temporary improvement in previous months – had weakened again.",
        "Council members expressed a view that the labour market conditions were not conducive to accelerating consumer demand growth.",
        "In particular, the employment in the corporate sector continues to decline, while the seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate increases, which translates into a weak wage growth.",
        "In this context, it was pointed out that the wage growth in the enterprise sector had been low and the real wage fund had declined.",
        "A few Council members noted, however, that the decline in inflation, in particular resulting from lower energy price growth, was conducive to strengthening the purchasing power of household incomes and to improving the financial position of enterprises.",
        "While discussing the monetary developments, some Council members pointed out that the household and corporate loan growth had weakened further.",
        "At the same time, it was indicated that household and corporate deposits had increased in March.",
        "According to some Council members, the growth in household deposits could have been caused by an increase in the propensity to save amid economic slowdown and deterioration of the labour market.",
        "Against this backdrop, falling deposit interest rates do not contain the propensity to save.",
        "In this context, it was also noted that the decreases of NBP interest rates to date had been passed on into deposit rates to a greater extent than rates on loans, including in particular consumer loans.",
        "While assessing the outlook for the economic activity in Poland, some Council members recognized that the uncertainty over the pace and timing of economic recovery had recently increased.",
        "This results in particular from deteriorating economic outlook abroad, which may translate into a lower contribution of net exports, the key demand factor of economic growth in the previous quarters, to GDP growth.",
        "Furthermore, some Council members emphasized no signals of a possible significant increase in domestic demand in the coming quarters.",
        "Some Council members also indicated that – due to higher than scheduled general government deficit in relation to GDP in 2012 and the likely upholding by the EU of excessive deficit procedure imposed on Poland – further fiscal tightening should be expected in the coming years, which would continue to contain demand growth.",
        "A temporary reduction in the investment co-financed with EU funds may be also conducive to lower economic activity.",
        "However, other Council members were of the opinion that the expected improvement in economic activity in Germany in the second half of 2013 should translate into a recovery in the Polish export sector.",
        "It was also noted that capacity utilization in the economy had grown in 2013 Q1, and that – in line with available forecasts – GDP growth should not decrease further and it is expected to accelerate gradually over coming quarters.",
        "With reference to price developments, the majority of the Council members highlighted a further decrease of the CPI annual index, which has been running below the lower limit for deviations from the NBP inflation target since February 2013.",
        "Hence, the CPI inflation declined below the March projection.",
        "It was also stressed that core inflation had continued to decline, which confirms low demand pressure in the economy.",
        "At the same time it was indicated that a decline in food and energy price growth had significantly contributed to a decrease in inflation over recent months.",
        "While assessing the outlook for inflation, the majority of Council members were of the opinion that in the coming quarters the CPI inflation was likely to stay below the March projection, which – along with the uncertainty over the pace of economic recovery in Poland – increases the risk of inflation running below the target in the medium term.",
        "Low inflation will also result from a decline in commodity prices in the global markets.",
        "Low inflation expectations of economic agents also point to no risk of a significant acceleration in the price growth.",
        "However, some Council members pointed out that given an expected global recovery in the second half of 2013, commodity prices in global markets may increase back in one-year time horizon.",
        "These members also emphasized that the March projection did not account for the impact of the maintaining heightened VAT rate on the level of inflation in 2014.",
        "However, other Council members noted that, even if no decrease in VAT rate was taken into account, inflation should remain below the March projection.",
        "While discussing the level of the NBP interest rates, the majority of Council members assessed that they should be lowered at the current meeting.",
        "However, their opinions differed as to the scale of the decrease.",
        "In turn, other Council members were of the opinion that the interest rates should be kept unchanged.",
        "The majority of Council members were of the opinion that an adjustment of monetary policy easing cycle was justified, as the incoming data did not indicate any clear signs of economic recovery in the Polish economy and its environment, while the decline in inflation was stronger than in the projection, which raised the risk of inflation staying below the target in the medium term.",
        "Moreover – despite the lowering of interest rates to date – faster than previously forecasted decline in inflation and inflation expectations had translated into an increase in real interest rates.",
        "At the same time, some Council members pointed out that – amid ample liquidity in global markets – a relatively high interest rate spread between Poland and developed economies might excessively intensify the portfolio capital inflows into Poland.",
        "According to a few Council members, the NBP interest rates should be adjusted as fast as possible, which supports the greater scale of their reduction at the current meeting.",
        "However, other Council members believed that due to expected acceleration in the GDP growth in the coming quarters and upside risks to inflation, the NBP interest rates should not be lowered at the current meeting, and furthermore, a few of those Council members argued that the cycle of the monetary policy easing should be terminated.",
        "In their opinion, the NBP interest rates were already at their historical lows and further decreases in the NBP interest rates would not support demand in the economy to a significant extent.",
        "In their opinion, the current slowdown was attributable mainly to weak sentiment of economic agents and a low external demand growth.",
        "Moreover, a few Council members were of the opinion that further lowering of interest rates could also adversely affect the restructuring in the Polish corporate sector, which influences economic growth over longer run.",
        "Low interest rates might also boost excessively risky investment projects.",
        "With reference to future decisions, some Council members reckoned that further interest rate decreases could be justified in the coming months if the probability of inflation running below the NBP target over the medium term rose.",
        "In the opinion of a few Council members, the results of the next inflation projection should be considered when assessing whether it could be justified to decrease the interest rates.",
        "At the meeting, a motion was submitted to lower the NBP basic interest rates by 0.50 percentage points.",
        "The motion did not pass.",
        "A motion was also submitted to lower the NBP basic interest rates by 0.25 percentage points.",
        "The Council decided to lower the NBP basic interest rates by 0.25 percentage points to the following levels: reference rate to 3.00%, lombard rate to 4.50%, deposit rate 1.50%, rediscount rate to 3.25%.",
        "At its meeting, members of the Monetary Policy Council discussed the current and future monetary policy decisions in the context of macroeconomic developments in Poland and abroad.",
        "While assessing economic conditions abroad, some members of the Council emphasised that although the situation in the United States was improving steadily, even though slowly, (as evidenced, in particular, by growing employment), global economic growth remained weak.",
        "In this context, it was pointed out that the euro area recession – which probably persisted in the first half of 2013 – had been accompanied by further downward revision of GDP growth forecasts for this economy and postponement of its recovery.",
        "Moreover, some members of the Council pointed to the signs of deteriorating economic climate in some major developing countries, including China, which negatively affected activity in the euro area, and, indirectly, also in Poland.",
        "At the same time, members of the Council observed that the second half of 2013 was expected to bring a gradual improvement in the global economic conditions and, in particular, an end to the euro area recession.",
        "A few members of the Council assessed that even amidst low GDP growth in the euro area, a relatively fast growth in Polish exports to that economy was possible, especially if economic activity in Germany remained considerably higher than in other euro area countries.",
        "It was pointed out that the recent signals from the Federal Reserve that it might start QE tapering caused a deterioration of the financial market sentiment.",
        "The deterioration of the global financial sentiment resulted in some outflow of capital from the emerging markets and a depreciation of their currencies.",
        "When assessing the impact of the situation in the international markets on the domestic financial market, some members of the Council emphasized that, as compared to other emerging economies, the change in prices of Polish assets (including an increase of yields on Treasury bonds and zloty depreciation) was limited.",
        "In the opinion of those Council members, this might be a sign of favourable perception by investors of the Polish economy fundamentals.",
        "Yet, a few Council members assessed that the risk of renewed rise in financial market uncertainty in emerging markets, including Poland, should be taken into account.",
        "They also pointed to the recent outflow of portfolio capital from Poland, related to lower relative attractiveness of investing in Polish Treasury bonds.",
        "Referring to the July NBP projection, some members of the Council emphasized that the central paths of GDP and inflation in Poland were slightly lower than those in the March projection; yet, this was mainly visible for the coming quarters.",
        "In the medium term, both projections were very similar and pointed to a gradual recovery in economic growth and a slow rise in inflation.",
        "When analysing the current economic situation in Poland, some Council members pointed to the signs of persistently weak domestic conditions, including further fall in industrial output in May 2013 and deepening decline in construction output, as well as continued slow growth in retail sales.",
        "Those members of the Council stressed that economic climate indicators did not clearly signal trends in economic activity, and the continued low level of lending to the private sector suggested that the possible strengthening of GDP growth in the coming quarters was likely to be gradual and moderate.",
        "0\nSome members of the Council argued that the significant decrease in the NBP interest rates implemented since November 2012 supported economic recovery, although it cannot completely offset the negative impact of external conditions, fiscal tightening and deteriorating corporate sentiment on domestic GDP growth.",
        "According to those members of the Council, economic growth is negatively influenced, in particular, by concerns about a prolonged recession or stagnation in the euro area, discouraging enterprises from investing.",
        "In such a situation, if the outlook for demand cease to deteriorate and if enterprises start to expect economic recovery in the coming quarters, lower cost of financing could become a significant factor supporting investment.",
        "In the opinion of a few Council members, increasing production capacity utilization and some rise in the total cost estimate value of newly launched investment were among signs of a possible recovery in investment activity in the near future.",
        "Low interest rates also encourage consumption, in particular by reducing households' loan repayment burden of zloty denominated loans.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members, in the longer term, domestic demand might also be supported by the launch of the new EU Financial Perspective for 2014-2020.",
        "At the same time, the expected recovery in consumption would reduce the contribution of net exports to GDP growth.",
        "A few Council members also pointed to the uncertainty about the scale of further fiscal tightening, which might be significantly smaller than currently declared.",
        "When addressing the situation in the labour market, attention was paid to slower decline in employment in the enterprise sector in May 2013, as expressed in annual terms.",
        "Yet, it was emphasised that, at that moment, it was difficult to assess the sustainability of the observed changes.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that unemployment continued at a relatively high level, further supporting low wage growth.",
        "While discussing inflation developments in Poland, attention was drawn to a further decline in inflation in May 2013, down to 0.5%, i.e.",
        "a level significantly below the NBP’s inflation target of 2.5%.",
        "Some members of the Council emphasized that the available forecasts pointed to the possibility of inflation running at a very low level in the coming months.",
        "Those Council members argued that also in the coming quarters inflation was likely to continue well below the NBP target.",
        "In their opinion, this was evidenced by the deepening decline in producer prices and low wage growth, indicating the absence of cost pressure in the economy, as well as stagnation in consumption in the 2013 Q1 and only a minor increase in retail sales in 2013 Q2, signalling the lack of demand pressure.",
        "When analysing the July inflation projection, some members of the Council emphasized that such factors as the gradual acceleration of economic growth and the probable persistently negative output gap until the end of the projection horizon would curb price growth in the coming quarters.",
        "Similarly, slow growth in unit labour costs and the expected – amidst low global demand – stabilization of commodity prices in the world markets should be conducive to low inflation.",
        "That meant, in the opinion of those Council members, that the return of inflation to the target would be gradual.",
        "Yet, other members of the Council pointed out that according to the July projection growth in food and energy prices, including oil prices, as well as growth in wages would remain below the level recorded in past, while zloty exchange rate was anticipated to be slightly stronger than currently observed.",
        "According to those Council members, should these variables develop more in line with previously observed values, it is likely that the rise in inflation will be faster than indicated by the July projection.",
        "In this context, a few members of the Council emphasized that some of the available forecasts, including forecasts by financial analysts, indicate the possibility of inflation returning to the target already in 2014.",
        "Those Council members also emphasized that the estimates of the current output gap, as being a non-observable variable, were always uncertain.",
        "According to the opinion of those Council members output gap may be less negative than indicated in the July projection.",
        "While discussing monetary policy decisions, some members of the Council assessed that interest rates were at very low levels, and their further reduction might discourage households from holding funds on bank accounts.",
        "A few Council members also emphasized that excessive interest rates cuts would create an incentive to accept greater risks, e.g.",
        "by undertaking low-productivity projects that eventually may prove unprofitable, and would lead to changes in the structure of bank lending (rising role of mortgage lending amidst reduced lending to companies).",
        "According to those Council members, for the above reasons it would be justified to keep the interest rates unchanged.",
        "Most of the Council members assessed, however, that the prolonged economic slowdown and the lack of inflationary pressure, together with the medium term outlook for the economy, as indicated, among others, by the July projection of inflation and GDP – spoke in favour of lowering interest rates at the current meeting.",
        "Further monetary policy easing was expected to support economic recovery and the return of inflation to the target.",
        "Most of the Council members agreed that the decision to cut interest rate taken in July should mark the end of the loosening cycle of monetary policy started in November 2012.",
        "Members of the Council pointed out that the gradual recovery in demand expected in the second half of the year should translate into a slightly stronger economic growth.",
        "However, in their opinion, in view of the persistently negative output gap, inflation was likely to remain at very low levels for several quarters ahead.",
        "Yet, according to those members of the Council, economic activity should steadily improve, which – combined with the effects of a significant monetary policy easing – would encourage the return of inflation to the target in the medium term.",
        "In the opinion of the majority of the Council members, the current level of interest rates, including the July cut, would support economic recovery and the return of inflation to the target, while, at the same time, it would reduce the risk of adverse effects of excessive interest rates cuts for the financial system and the economy.",
        "In addition, those Council members pointed out that signalling the end of the loosening cycle would contribute to reducing the uncertainty about monetary policy in the future.",
        "A few Council members pointed out, however, that no declarations as to probable future course of monetary policy should be made.",
        "They claimed that at present it was difficult to assess the impact of the government’s planned changes in public expenditure and revenue on economic activity and inflation in Poland.",
        "In the opinion of those Council members, another reason against declaring probable future course of monetary policy was the persistent uncertainty about financial markets' response to the signals of limiting monetary expansion in the United States and to the assessment of the economic and institutional reforms in the euro area.",
        "At the meeting, a motion was submitted to lower the NBP basic interest rates by 0.25 percentage points.",
        "The Council decided to lower the NBP basic interest rates by 0.25 percentage points to the following levels: reference rate to 2.50%, lombard rate to 4.00%, deposit rate to 1.00%, rediscount rate to 2.75%.",
        "At its meeting, the Monetary Policy Council discussed the current and future monetary policy decisions against the background of macroeconomic data and the March projection of inflation and GDP.",
        "While analysing the external conditions, it was pointed out that in 2012 Q4 economic growth in the United States had come to a halt and economic activity in the euro area had remained weak.",
        "It was emphasised that GDP in most euro area countries, including its largest economies, i.e.",
        "France and Germany being Poland’s main trading partner, had declined in that period.",
        "At the same time, attention was drawn to signs of some improvement in economic indicators in several euro area countries in the first months of 2013.",
        "However, there were doubts expressed whether this already indicated a recovery in these countries.",
        "Some Council members expected the recession in the euro area to abate at a slow pace.",
        "In this context, attention was drawn to an increase in political uncertainty in Italy, which could dampen the business sentiment in the euro area and in the financial markets.",
        "While analysing the economic developments in Poland, the Council members emphasised that the GDP data on 2012 Q4 had confirmed a pronounced slowdown in the economy in that period.",
        "Attention was drawn to continued weakening in domestic demand, which was driven by both further investment decline and decreasing consumer demand.",
        "It was indicated that the monthly data, released since the previous meeting, implied that also in early 2013 the economic activity had remained weak.",
        "At the same time, it was noted that the monthly data on industrial output and retail sales were somewhat better than had been expected and some economic indicators had improved of late, which might suggest an increase in economic activity in the coming quarters.",
        "The majority of the Council members were of the opinion that an on-going deterioration in labour market conditions and slow household lending growth were containing demand growth in Poland, in particular with respect to consumer demand.",
        "Against this backdrop, some Council members pointed to a continued gradual rise in the unemployment rate observed in recent years.",
        "This limits wage pressure in the economy and adversely affects consumption growth.",
        "However, a few Council members noted that rising unemployment rate in the past few years had been driven to a large extent by growing labour supply rather than falling employment.",
        "While discussing lending developments, an opinion was voiced that credit policy tightening of banks was an important factor behind weaker lending growth.",
        "Against this background, a few Council members pointed out that even if standards for household lending were eased, this would not translate into any marked rebound in household lending due to declining household credit demand.",
        "It was pointed out that cuts in the NBP interest rates would contribute to faster lending growth.",
        "At the same time, a few Council members emphasised that the recent NBP interest rate cuts had translated into greater decreases in interest rates for bank deposits than for bank loans, while household and corporate lending growth remained low despite monetary policy easing, which was due to lower credit demand.",
        "A few Council members pointed out that lower interest rates on bank deposits might weaken household propensity to save.",
        "While discussing the outlook for economic growth against the background of the March projection, the majority of the Council members stressed that, according to the projection, even though the 0 0-919 Wars zawa u l Święto krzys ka 1 1 /2 1 phon e (+4 8) 2 2 653 2 8 88  +4 8  3  GDP growth would probably accelerate gradually in the coming quarters, it would remain low.",
        "It was also pointed out that in line with the projection, domestic demand growth would continue to be very slow in 2013, with the output gap remaining negative over the projection horizon.",
        "This suggests a limited risk of mounting wage pressure in the coming years.",
        "Yet, a few Council members were of the opinion that GDP growth might run slightly higher than projected.",
        "These members argued specifically that improvement in the economic situation abroad, as assumed in the projection, should translate into faster GDP growth in Poland.",
        "In addition, referring to the data on restructuring in the Polish enterprise sector, these members expressed their doubts on the total factor productivity growth assumed in the projection.",
        "In their opinion, this growth could be lower compared to the projection, which would result in potential output growing slower and output gap closing faster than in the projection.",
        "While analysing CPI inflation developments, attention was drawn to its decline in January 2013 close to the lower limit for deviations from the NBP inflation target.",
        "It was stressed that in line with the March projection – under the assumption of unchanged interest rates –inflation would remain close to the lower limit for deviations from the inflation target over the projection horizon.",
        "In the light of the projection, such CPI inflation developments are to result from low energy price growth in the coming years and a decline in core inflation.",
        "The expected decrease in core inflation and unit labour costs growth indicate still low demand and cost pressure in the years to come.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members, inflation might run above the projection path.",
        "Those members indicated that the global geopolitical situation remained an important upside risk for energy prices.",
        "They also argued that – under the assumption of faster growth in energy prices – inflation might run close to the inflation target in the coming quarters, hence above the projection.",
        "A few Council members were of the opinion that, given an acceleration in labour productivity growth as shown in the projection, wage growth should not run close to historical lows.",
        "As a result, unit labour costs might, in their opinion, grow faster than in the projection, which would contribute to higher inflation.",
        "Also faster than projected growth in private consumption might spark faster price growth.",
        "Moreover, it was pointed out that another factor increasing CPI inflation compared to projection path was that VAT rate hike could remain in force in the coming years, should the impact of economic downturn on the public finance sector prove to be stronger than currently assumed.",
        "While discussing the NBP interest rates, the majority of the Council members decided that they should be lowered at the March meeting.",
        "However, their opinions differed as to the scale of the NBP interest rate cuts.",
        "Some members of the Council assessed, though, that the interest rates should be kept unchanged at the current meeting.",
        "The majority of the Council members assessed that – as the March projection assumed inflation to stay markedly below the NBP inflation target and the output gap to remain negative in the coming years – it was justified to continue to lower the NBP interest rates.",
        "In this context, these members argued that, even after interest rate cuts, real interest rates would remain markedly positive at levels ensuring that the risk of a build-up of imbalances in the economy would be contained.",
        "The majority of the Council members were of the opinion that the incoming data and the outlook for the economy as shown in the projection justified stronger interest rate cuts than at previous meetings.",
        "However, a few Council members reckoned that the scale of the interest rate cuts at the March meeting should not be larger than at the previous meetings.",
        "In the opinion of these Council members, concerns of excessive interest rate cuts leading to a further decline in propensity to save in the banking sector, suggest maintaining the previous pace of monetary policy easing.",
        "On the other hand, a few Council members assessed that the current interest rate level was low as compared to previous periods of the economic slowdown, and that further monetary policy easing was unjustified.",
        "Therefore, in their opinion, as the risk of inflation running above the projection was high in the medium term, the current interest rate level was appropriate for inflation to return to the target over this period.",
        "They assessed that excessive interest rate cuts would undermine the supply side of the economy, including the restructuring intensity in the enterprise sector, and as a result might have an adverse effect on GDP growth in the longer run.",
        "In the opinion of the majority of the Council members, the interest rate cuts both at the current and at the previous meetings, will help to ease monetary conditions and support higher economic growth, and consequently, help to bring inflation close to the target in the medium term.",
        "The majority of the Council members recognised that the decision to lower interest rates at the current meeting complemented the interest rate cut cycle.",
        "However, a few Council members did not rule out the possibility of a further interest rate adjustment, should the incoming data point to weaker economic activity or lower inflation than in the March projection.",
        "At the meeting, a motion was submitted to lower the NBP basic interest rates by 0.50 percentage points.",
        "A motion was also submitted to lower the NBP basic interest rates by 0.25 percentage points.",
        "As the motion to lower the NBP basic interest rates by 0.50 percentage points had passed, this motion was not voted on.",
        "The Council decided to lower the NBP basic interest rates by 0.50 percentage points to the following levels: reference rate to 3.25%, lombard rate to 4.75%, deposit rate to 1.75% and rediscount rate to 3.50%."

    "2014": [
        "At its meeting, members of the Monetary Policy Council discussed the current and future monetary policy decisions in the context of macroeconomic developments in Poland and abroad.",
        "While discussing economic activity abroad, it was indicated that the global recovery is still moderate.",
        "Data on euro area point to a slowly improving economic conditions.",
        "In turn, activity growth in the United States – which is visibly stronger than in the euro area – recorded signs of weakening in comparison to previous expectations.",
        "At the same time, in China and in other emerging economies, where growth has slowed down to a low level (considering their past performance), there is persisting uncertainty about future developments in GDP.",
        "A few members of the Council also highlighted that, taking into consideration the significant scale and limited effectiveness of the stimulus provided so far to the emerging economies, there is little scope for revival of economic activity through additional actions of these countries’ authorities.",
        "While analysing the external environment of the Polish economy, the Council also discussed reaction of the financial markets to the QE tapering of the Federal Reserve and to the increased risk of Argentina suspending its debt servicing.",
        "These events have had a negative effect on the sentiment of market participants.",
        "The deterioration in investor sentiment, in particular in relation to certain emerging economies, resulted in an outflow of capital from some of these countries and a weakening of their currencies.",
        "In order to limit the scale of the depreciation, some of the central banks intervened on the currency market or raised their interest rates.",
        "Some of the Council members pointed to the fact that monetary policy tightening was conducted in economies characterised by heightened inflation and substantial external imbalances.",
        "Therefore, the increase in interest rates in these countries was supporting the restoring of their macroeconomic equilibrium – both internal and external.",
        "In Poland the exchange rate of the zloty – i.e.",
        "the currency of a country usually included in the group of emerging markets – has weakened relatively slightly.",
        "According to the Council members, the resilience of the zloty to changes in the sentiment of the financial markets is supported by the relatively favourable economic situation in Poland, including the lack of any significant imbalances.",
        "Referring to domestic economic growth, it was stressed that preliminary GDP data for 2013, as well as monthly data on economic activity and indicators of economic conditions point to a continued gradual recovery of growth.",
        "The Council members drew attention to the fact that the implied GDP data for 2013 Q4 confirm that net exports are still contributing substantially to GDP growth, while domestic demand remained weak (this relates in particular to investment demand).",
        "Some of the Council members argued that the current structure of GDP growth – based to a large degree on exports, with only a gradual recovery of domestic demand – supports the maintenance of low inflationary pressure and, at the same time, contributes to the Polish economy remaining balanced.",
        "According to some members of the Council, in successive quarters – together with further improvement in growth prospects – investment activity should increase significantly.",
        "Some of the Council members argued that taking into account good financial situation of companies and low credit costs, relatively high capacity utilization should be a factor encouraging firms to invest.",
        "These Council members emphasised that favourable prospects for corporate investment growth are indicated by the NBP business tendency surveys, which show an increase in investment outlays planned for 2014, as well as an increase in the percentage of companies intending to begin new projects.",
        "A few of the Council members pointed out that the revival of outlays on fixed assets should also be supported by a rebound of investments related to further inflow of EU funds, in particular to the local government sector.",
        "While analysing the prospects for further recovery in consumption, the Council members indicated that growth of disposable income is still low, limiting the increase in household expenditure.",
        "At the same time, a few Council members assessed that low inflation and a gradual improvement in the situation on the labour market will be conducive to the revival in individual consumption in the coming quarters.",
        "While discussing the outlook for external trade, some members of the Council pointed out that low labour costs in Poland continue to support high price competitiveness of Polish goods abroad, and hence – exports growth.",
        "The favourable outlook for exports performance is also related to the anticipated acceleration of growth in Poland's main trading partner countries, as signalled by the upward revisions of their GDP growth forecasts.",
        "At the same time, a few Council members assessed that stronger import growth resulting from the expected investment revival will dampen the contribution of net exports to GDP growth.",
        "While analysing trends in lending, some of the Council members pointed to the still weak credit growth.",
        "In particular, corporate lending for financing investment continues to rise only slowly, which – in the opinion of those Council members – indicates persistently high risk aversion on the part of both banks and enterprises.",
        "Yet, a few Council members stressed that growth in credit to the private sector has accelerated.",
        "They highlighted, in particular, the increasing availability of corporate credit, evidenced by the rising percentage of loan applications being approved.",
        "With corporate investment expected to accelerate in the subsequent quarters, this will facilitate a revival in lending to that sector, especially amidst banks’ declarations of looser lending criteria for some types of loans.",
        "Addressing labour market conditions, some members of the Council pointed out that so far they have been improving very slowly.",
        "In particular, employment growth is insufficient to bring down the unemployment rate.",
        "In effect, as at the end of 2013, the unemployment rate was still relatively high.",
        "A few Council members were of the opinion that since the probability of finding a job has risen – as has the ratio of nonsubsidised vacancies to the number of the jobless – the outlook for labour market developments is favourable.",
        "In the opinion of those Council members, positive signs in this respect include also some improvement in willingness of increasing employment declared by enterprises and a decline in fears of losing a job reported by private individuals.",
        "In the context of labour market impact on inflation, some of the Council members observed that the persistently high unemployment rate has a mitigating effect on both cost and demand pressures (on the former, by restricting wage pressure, on the latter, by reducing disposable income).",
        "Those Council members noted that in the past few years wage and unit labour cost (ULC) growth has been slow.",
        "A few Council members assessed that, also over the next few quarters, ULC growth should remain slow.",
        "Yet other members of the Council argued that in response to the improving economic conditions, wage pressure may materialise fairly promptly, hence the pace of ULC growth may pick up substantially within a short span of time.",
        "While analysing inflation developments, the Council members highlighted that inflation – including core inflation – continued to be very low, and the available forecasts point to it likely remaining low also in the subsequent quarters.",
        "Low core inflation is supported by a further decline in producer prices and sustained low inflation in Poland's main trading partners.",
        "In turn, the risk of substantial rise in energy or food prices is constrained by the conditions in international commodity markets, where the moderate scale of global economic recovery is conducive to price stabilisation.",
        "Therefore there is no significant risk of inflationary pressure rising markedly in Poland in the nearest future.",
        "At the same time, a few Council members argued that in its monetary policy decisions the central bank should take into account the fact that the current low inflation is partly related to temporary factors remaining beyond the influence of domestic monetary policy.",
        "The Council decided that the NBP interest rates should remain unchanged at the current meeting.",
        "Furthermore, the Council maintained its assessment that the gradual improvement in economic conditions was likely to continue over the coming quarters, while inflation pressure would remain limited.",
        "In this context, the Council confirmed that it would be justified to maintain the interest rates at the current level at least until the end of the first half of 2014.",
        "At the same time, Council members recognized that the findings of the March NBP projection would enable a more comprehensive assessment of medium-term outlook for inflation and economic growth.",
        "The Council left the basic interest rates unchanged at the following levels: reference rate at 2.50%, lombard rate at 4.00%, deposit rate at 1.00%, rediscount rate at 2.75%.",
        "at least two years, and the interest rates in the euro area might stay close to zero even over a longer term.",
        "Attention was also drawn to interest rate decreases in countries strongly linked to the euro area, including economies which were still growing at a relatively fast pace.",
        "Moreover, few Council members pointed out that the expansionary monetary policy of the major central banks had resulted in an increased upward pressure on currencies of some countries with a significant interest rate differential to the major economies.",
        "While discussing economic conditions in Poland, the Council members emphasized that in 2014 Q3 the economic growth had probably continued to decelerate.",
        "Some Council members indicated the slowdown in economic growth could be shallow.",
        "It was noted that the slowdown had been caused mainly by weaker external demand, which was translating into slower export growth, and declining sentiment of economic agents, which resulted in a deceleration in private investment outlays.",
        "These factors of economic slowdown are reflected in the incoming data, which show that export growth has almost come to a halt and export orders have decreased, while industrial production in 2014 Q3 grew slower than a quarter before, on average.",
        "However, some Council members pointed out that recent data readings might indicate recovery in economic activity in the coming quarters.",
        "In particular, in September both industrial production and construction output increased, while sentiment improved after several months of decline.",
        "Moreover, a gradual acceleration of corporate lending and stable growth of housing loans suggest that growth in investment demand in 2014 Q3 might remain moderate.",
        "Some Council members also pointed to still favourable consumer confidence, stable retail sales growth and a steady increase in employment.",
        "They indicated that the probability of finding a job had increased, while the probability of losing a job remained stable.",
        "While discussing the economic outlook for Poland, Council members highlighted that the November projection pointed to lower GDP growth than in the previous round.",
        "However, some Council members emphasized that in accordance with the central projection path, i.e.",
        "the most likely outcome, the annual GDP growth would start to slightly accelerate in 2015 Q2.",
        "Economic growth should then stabilise above 3%, i.e.",
        "will grow at a pace close to potential output growth.",
        "This underpins the view expressed by these Council members that – notwithstanding the adverse external conditions – economic outlook for Poland remains favourable.",
        "Furthermore, these members cited external forecasts, which also suggested that moderate recovery of the Polish economy could resume in the following quarters.",
        "At the same time, some Council members stressed that the probability of economic growth being weaker than indicated by the central projection path was significant.",
        "This is demonstrated in strong asymmetry of the probability distribution in GDP projection, associated mainly with the risk of prolonged weak economic growth in the euro area.",
        "These members also highlighted that several external institutions had revised their forecasts for economic growth in Poland downwards and that the uncertainty related to global economic conditions continued.",
        "Referring to inflation developments in Poland, Council members noted that in September the annual growth of consumer price index was still negative.",
        "It was emphasized that although deflation in Poland had been caused largely by external factors (reflected, in particular, in a decline in food and energy prices), the price growth in Poland had been also dampened by no demand pressure, as most core inflation indicators were at zero.",
        "In this context, it was highlighted that wage and cost pressures in the economy were still low, as shown by the weak growth of unit labour costs and the continued decline in producer prices on an annual basis.",
        "With regard to the outlook for inflation, it was emphasized that in the November projection the inflation path was below the July projection, and stayed below the NBP inflation target throughout the projection horizon.",
        "At the same time, some Council members highlighted that, like for the GDP projection, the asymmetry in the balance of risks for the inflation forecast was significant.",
        "This points to a relatively high probability of inflation staying below the central path.",
        "These members pointed out that, in contrast with the July projection, the output gap would remain negative throughout the November projection horizon.",
        "Therefore, the period of low demand pressure will be longer than envisaged in the previous projection.",
        "They also argued that external forecasts supported the view that inflation in Poland would remain low.",
        "On the other hand, other Council members emphasized that, in line with the central projection path from November, inflation should rise gradually, to return to the band for deviations from the target by the end of the projection period.",
        "According to these Council members, inflation might be slightly higher than in the November projection, returning close to target within the monetary policy horizon, as indicated by several forecasts.",
        "While discussing the interest rate decision, some Council members assessed that the monetary policy adjustment should be continued at the November meeting.",
        "In their opinion, factors in favour of further interest rate adjustment included ongoing deflation, very low inflation expectations and the forecasts indicating that inflation would remain below the target in the following years.",
        "Further monetary policy adjustment was also justified by a deceleration in domestic economic growth and a risk of further slowdown due to the weakening economic growth outlook in the external environment of the Polish economy.",
        "In the opinion of these Council members, further decrease in interest rates would cushion the adverse impact of weakening external demand on domestic economic activity growth.",
        "Moreover, they emphasized that the persistence of the significant interest rate differential between Poland and its external environment might result in later return of inflation to its target through upward pressure on the zloty.",
        "Few Council members noted that interest rate decreases would reduce the public debt servicing costs and therefore support the economic policy of the Government.",
        "Nonetheless, the majority of Council members were of the opinion that the interest rates should remain unchanged at the November meeting.",
        "These members argued that the slowdown in GDP growth could be temporary and shallow.",
        "They also emphasized that the decrease in inflation and the weakening in economic activity were mainly driven by factors beyond the impact of domestic monetary policy, including significant uncertainty undermining the growth of spending by private agents.",
        "Few Council members stressed that after the NBP reference rate had been decreased in October, another large cut would imply that the real interest rates deflated by inflation expected over the monetary policy horizon would be near zero or even negative, which could result in emergence of economic imbalances.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members, further interest rate decreases could stimulate excessive credit growth in the economy and weaken the incentives to restructure enterprises.",
        "In the assessment of the Council members who were in favour of keeping interest rates unchanged, given the current level of interest rates there is still space for monetary policy easing, should it become necessary in case of significant turbulence in global financial markets.",
        "Some of the Council members who supported keeping interest rates unchanged assessed that the October adjustment of interest rates provided sufficient monetary policy impulse to support the return of inflation to close to the target within the monetary policy horizon, in the light of the current data and the November projection results.",
        "Few of them also emphasized a need for an assessment period to analyse the impact of the October interest rate cut.",
        "They also highlighted that prudent monetary policy was a value which should be preserved in order to maintain macroeconomic and financial stability.",
        "However, these members indicated that uncertainty over economic conditions in the future had recently increased.",
        "Hence, they did not exclude a possibility of further monetary policy adjustment if economic conditions deteriorate in Poland and abroad, particularly in the euro area.",
        "At the meeting a motion was submitted to lower NBP interest rates by 1.00 percentage point.",
        "The motion did not pass.",
        "A motion was also submitted to lower NBP interest rates by 0.50 percentage points.",
        "The motion did not pass.",
        "A motion was also submitted to lower NBP interest rates by 0.25 percentage points.",
        "The motion did not pass.",
        "The Council decided to keep NBP interest rates at the following levels: the reference rate at 2.00%, the lombard rate at 3.00%, the deposit rate at 1.00%, the rediscount rate at 2.25%.",
        "At its meeting, members of the Monetary Policy Council discussed the current and future monetary policy decisions in the context of macroeconomic developments in Poland and abroad.",
        "While discussing external developments, it was pointed out that activity growth in the global economy is still moderate.",
        "The Council members noted that – after a temporary slowdown – the latest data point to improved economic conditions in the United States, while recovery in the euro area continues to be slow.",
        "At the same time, the Chinese economy is most likely slowing down further.",
        "The Council members emphasised that inflation is low in many countries, which – if continues – may impede the deleveraging process in the largest economies.",
        "A few Council members referred to the factors which in their opinion may translate into a permanent decrease of global inflation.",
        "These factors include: a slower economic growth of the world economy and a downturn in the long-term commodity price cycle.",
        "Some of the Council members argued that for the next few years economic growth in the largest emerging economies will have a positive impact on the growth of global economic activity, which should be conducive to higher inflation around the world.",
        "While analysing the external environment, it was pointed out that inflation in the euro area decreased to a very low level, which convinced the ECB to signal a possibility of further monetary policy easing.",
        "At the same time, however, a few members of the Council pointed out that low inflation in the euro area is mainly the result of strongly negative growth in energy prices – a favourable supply shock, which supports revival of the demand in this economy.",
        "Falling unit labour costs in member states most severely affected by the debt crisis is also a factor lowering inflation in the euro area.",
        "Decreasing unit labour costs help those countries overcome the recession, while preserving the competitiveness of German exports against countries outside the euro area.",
        "Those Council members also argued that a possible deflation in the euro area would not be significant enough to discourage agents from purchases, so the risk of second-round effects of price decreases is not significant.",
        "At the same time, in the opinion of those members of the Council, the continuation of highly expansionary monetary policy by the ECB – by increasing the risk of bubbles arising in the asset market – may even contribute to decreasing inflation.",
        "Other Council members assessed that possible emergence of expectations on falling prices may strengthen deflation tendencies in the euro area, and therefore the ECB will probably attempt to counteract this situation.",
        "While analysing the outlook for economic conditions, it was pointed out that increasing importance of domestic demand in economic growth in Germany is a positive development.",
        "At the same time, some Council members stressed that the slowdown in economic growth in China may be a factor of risk for the improvement of economic conditions in Germany, and thus also in Poland.",
        "A few Council members assessed that due to a sharp rise in Chinese internal debt after the global financial crisis, currently it is difficult to expect a stimulus to the Chinese economy.",
        "The Council members pointed out another source of uncertainty surrounding the outlook for economic growth in Poland is the situation in Ukraine – including the scale of the expected recession in the Ukrainian economy and the risk related to disturbances in economic relations between Ukraine and Russia.",
        "It was indicated that possible escalation of the conflict between Ukraine and Russia may undermine Poland's trade with the Eastern markets.",
        "In the view of currently available information, it was judged that although the potential weakening in Poland's exports to the Eastern markets may negatively affect some companies, it will not be a factor significantly reducing economic activity growth in the whole economy.",
        "While discussing the financial markets’ response to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, it was emphasised that the zloty exchange rate has remained relatively stable, the yields on Polish sovereign bonds have not changed significantly and the impact on stock valuations was temporary.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members, favourable foreign investor sentiment towards the Polish economy is supported by its strong fundamentals and the lack of macroeconomic imbalances.",
        "While analysing current data, it was highlighted that the accelerating growth of industrial output and retail sales together with the rebound in construction activity confirm a continued gradual economic recovery.",
        "At the same time, strong readings of most business climate indicators suggest probable activity growth continuing also in the subsequent quarters.",
        "Some of the Council members assessed that the rise in GDP growth may be quite substantial due to the possible acceleration in corporate investment spending in the nearest future.",
        "However, at the same time, some Council members pointed to the weakening of firms' expectations regarding their export orders, which may signal slower external demand, stemming firms' propensity to invest.",
        "Furthermore, a few Council members argued that, as slower economic growth abroad is probably a more durable phenomenon, GDP growth in Poland may remain moderate.",
        "In their opinion, a factor which may hamper consumer demand growth is substantial long-term indebtedness of some households.",
        "Council members emphasised that the recovery of the Polish economy is starting to translate into labour market conditions.",
        "Employment in the corporate sector is gradually rising, with a concurrent decline in unemployment.",
        "Yet it was stressed that the unemployment rate persists at an elevated level, which constrains wage pressure.",
        "At the same time, a few Council members argued that while wage growth continued to be moderate, yet – considering low inflation – households’ real disposable income growth is rising, which supports higher consumption growth.",
        "Some Council members emphasised that lending growth, while somewhat stronger, remains slow.",
        "It was observed that firms' higher propensity to invest – observed against the background of low interest rates and improving business climate – is accompanied by higher corporate credit growth.",
        "At the same time, a few Council members observed that low interest rates on deposits continue to limit the incentives to save in the banking system.",
        "While discussing inflationary processes, Council members pointed to inflation remaining markedly below the NBP inflation target, core inflation continuing at low levels, further decline in producer prices and low inflation expectations.",
        "Some Council members emphasised that the available forecasts pointed to a very slow increase in inflation and the absence of risks to price stability in the medium term.",
        "The Council decided that the NBP interest rates should remain unchanged at the current meeting.",
        "Furthermore, the Council maintained its assessment that the NBP interest rates should be kept unchanged for a longer period of time, i.e.",
        "at least until the end of the third quarter of 2014.",
        "The Council members observed that a more comprehensive assessment of a need to change the horizon of keeping the interest rates at the current level will probably be possible during the July meeting of the Council, when a new NBP projection is to be presented.",
        "The Council left the NBP interest rates unchanged at the following levels: the reference rate at 2.50%, the lombard rate at 4.00%, the deposit rate at 1.00% and the rediscount rate at 2.75%.",
        "at a historically low level, while simultaneously running an asset purchase programme; the European Central Bank does not exclude the possibility that the programme might be expanded to include more instruments.",
        "According to few Council members this could limit the risk of deflation in the euro area.",
        "While discussing economic situation in Poland, Council members observed that GDP growth in 2014 Q3 had weakened only slightly and was higher than expected.",
        "Some Council members also highlighted the favourable structure of GDP growth.",
        "They pointed to flagging external demand as the principal source of weaker economic growth.",
        "Domestic demand, in turn, remained relatively robust, supported by a stable expansion in consumer demand and steeper growth in investment spending.",
        "Some Council members also pointed to rising business climate indicators, faster than a year ago credit growth and a further improvement in labour market conditions.",
        "Other Council members emphasized that retail sales growth and industrial output growth had remained low in October, while construction and assembly output had declined, which might signal further growth weakening in 2014 Q4.",
        "Few Council members believed that this enhanced the risk of slower growth in investment expenditures in the Polish economy.",
        "Some Council members also drew attention to the fact that nominal GDP growth – due to GDP deflator having sunk almost to zero – was running at one of the lowest levels in the past decade.",
        "Slow nominal growth hampers the process of reducing the debt in relation to GDP – both public and private.",
        "In the opinion of those Council members, moderate real GDP growth coupled with core inflation running close to zero, corroborate the existence of negative output gap in Poland.",
        "Yet, other Council members believed that despite a slight slowdown, GDP growth was running close to that of the potential output, with domestic demand growing even faster.",
        "According to those Council members, should robust expansion in domestic demand be sustained, it might boost the current account deficit, currently being contained by the declining commodity prices.",
        "While discussing the prospects for economic growth in Poland, some Council members stressed that both the baseline scenario of the November projection and internal short-term forecasts pointed to only slight weakening of GDP growth in the coming quarters, with a subsequent return of moderate recovery.",
        "Council members pointed out that since the current weakening of GDP growth had mainly been driven by external factors, future economic growth in the euro area would be of particular significance to economic activity trends in Poland.",
        "Few Council members argued that a slight rise in economic growth expected in the euro area over the next few quarters would support GDP growth in Poland.",
        "Yet, other Council members highlighted the continued risk of prolonged low economic growth in the euro area, which might adversely affect GDP growth in Poland in the longer term.",
        "With regard to inflationary processes at home, it was pointed out that the annual consumer price growth fell yet again in October and was running below the forecasts.",
        "Consumer prices deflation was accompanied by a further decline in producer prices in industry.",
        "Some Council members emphasized that inflation in Poland was currently driven mainly by external factors bringing about, above all, a decrease in energy and food prices.",
        "Few of the Council members were of the opinion that such sources of negative price growth were indicated by sound – despite a rapid rise in the corporate wage bill – financial performance of enterprises, as well as a decline in corporate operating costs, in particular costs of materials.",
        "Some Council members, in turn, emphasized the absence of demand pressure as a factor, which, along with external factors, contributed to lower inflation.",
        "In the opinion of those Council members this was indicated by a further decline in core inflation indices, whose average – for the first time on record – sank below zero.",
        "Some Council members also pointed to very low inflation expectations of households and businesses, and declining inflation expectations of professional forecasters.",
        "At the same time, it was emphasized that inflation forecasts had been once again revised downwards, indicating that deflation was likely to persist somewhat beyond the end of 2014.",
        "In the opinion of few Council members, CPI growth in Poland might remain relatively low in the longer term, due to the persistent downward trend in commodity prices in the global markets.",
        "Yet, other members of the Council argued that the impact of lower commodity prices on inflation should be short-lived.",
        "While discussing the outlook for inflation, attention was also drawn to a significant impact of future exchange rate of the zloty on price developments.",
        "While referring to the possible effects of deflation in Poland, it was emphasized that considerable uncertainty remained as to its impact on decisions of economic agents, in particular enterprises.",
        "In addition, it was noted that economic consequences of deflation would depend on its level, sources and duration.",
        "Some Council members pointed out that extended period of negative price growth increased the risk of inflation expectations remaining at low levels and – as a consequence – adverse effects of deflation on the economy.",
        "Other Council members argued, however, that no negative effects of deflation on decisions of businesses and households had been observed so far.",
        "They pointed out that 2014 Q3 brought an acceleration in growth of consumption and investment, and enterprises continued to post good financial results.",
        "Financial results of enterprises were supported by declining production costs driven by falling commodity prices.",
        "In the opinion of few members of the Council, deflation in the coming months would not adversely affect economic growth; on the contrary, it could rather support consumption and investment, as its main driving force was the decline in agricultural and energy commodity prices.",
        "While discussing the interest rate decision, most members of the Council believed that at the current meeting interest rates should remain unchanged.",
        "Some Council members indicated that the decline in GDP growth was slight, and its growth prospects in the coming quarters remained relatively favourable.",
        "According to those Council members, the weakening of GDP growth and deflation were mainly driven by external factors and therefore the impact of domestic monetary policy on economic processes was limited.",
        "Few members of the Council pointed out that – considering current inflation forecasts – the level of real interest rates ex ante was at present relatively low, while other Council members stressed that the real interest rates deflated with current CPI were higher than the nominal interest rates.",
        "According to few members of the Council, further interest rate cuts could lead to external imbalances and excessively boost credit growth in the economy, including lending to households, which did not finance investments supporting growth of potential output.",
        "Those members were also of the opinion that low interest rates weakened the selection of economic agents and – consequently – inhibited productivity growth.",
        "In this context, they pointed to the recent years’ very low contribution of the movement of production factors between sectors to productivity growth.",
        "Other Council members indicated that without growing consumption and with flagging external demand also private investment would decelerate.",
        "Few Council members also argued that interest rates if kept unchanged at the current meeting would leave room for possible easing of monetary policy in the event of a significant economic downturn or disturbances in the financial system.",
        "Some Council members who were in favour of keeping interest rates unchanged at the current meeting emphasized that they did not rule out the possibility of a further adjustment of interest rates.",
        "In the opinion of those members, lowering of interest rates could be justified by longer periods of price declines, increasing the risk of adverse effects of deflation on the economy.",
        "Interest rate adjustment would also be justified if the incoming data confirm that the slowdown in domestic economic activity would prevail and that weak growth in the environment of the Polish economy was likely to continue.",
        "Some Council members also pointed out that persisting significant spread in interest rates between Poland and its environment would increase the risk of appreciation of the zloty, which, in turn, could delay the return of inflation to the target.",
        "Few members argued that interest rate cuts would reduce the spread between the deposit rate and the expected rates of return on investment, which would, in turn, support growth in investment outlays and limit the negative impact of deflation on businesses’ propensity to invest.",
        "Few Council members were of the opinion that amidst persistently negative price growth and moderate GDP growth, as well as the high likelihood of inflation remaining below the target in the event of low probability of significant acceleration of economic growth in the coming quarters, it was justified to lower interest rates considerably already at the current meeting.",
        "According to those members of the Council, such decision was also supported by the fact that interest rate cuts in the absence of inflation risk would reduce the public debt servicing costs and thus support the government's economic policy.",
        "These members also believed that interest rate cuts – reducing their spread between interest rates in the environment of the Polish economy – would minimize the risk to the country’s financial stability related to the potential inflow of speculative capital and its subsequent outflow.",
        "At the meeting a motion was submitted to lower the NBP interest rates by 1.00 percentage point.",
        "The motion did not pass.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates at the following levels: the reference rate at 2.00%, the lombard rate at 3.00%, the deposit rate at 1.00%, the rediscount rate at 2.25%.",
        "While discussing business conditions in Poland's external environment, Council members pointed out that global activity growth remained moderate and varied considerably across the regions.",
        "They emphasised that recovery continued in the United States, although its pace remained slower than in the previous business cycles.",
        "Council members observed that GDP growth in the euro area had been weak and that business climate indicators had deteriorated recently.",
        "Some Council members also drew attention to the downward revisions of growth forecasts for the euro area by international institutions.",
        "Council members also pointed to deteriorating business conditions in Germany, Poland's main trading partner, reflected in the declining levels of the PMI and IFO indices in the past few months, and in the sharp fall in industrial output and new orders in August.",
        "Council members indicated that in other large euro area economies, including Italy and France, economic activity growth remained slow and hampered by structural problems of these countries.",
        "While discussing economic situation in the largest emerging economies, it was observed that the Russian economy might be in recession in 2014 Q3, while growth in China had probably slowed down.",
        "It was argued that the deteriorating economic situation of these countries would adversely impact Germany's exports, which in turn might subsequently weigh on the growth of Polish exports.",
        "Council members highlighted a significant decline in the prices of commodities over the recent months, which supported a decrease in inflation in Poland and in its environment, including the euro area.",
        "It was observed that the euro area inflation had been gradually trending down towards zero.",
        "While discussing monetary policy abroad, Council members underlined that the tapering of quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve was occurring against the background of the ECB stepping up its monetary expansion.",
        "It was pointed out that due to the divergence between monetary policy of the Federal Reserve and the ECB, the euro has recently weakened against the dollar, which would boost the euro area's price competitiveness vis-a-vis the US economy.",
        "The euro weakening was also accompanied by the złoty depreciation against the dollar.",
        "It was indicated that the ECB launched the first conditional liquidity provision operations to banks in September and announced the start of asset purchases in 2014 Q4.",
        "Some Council members assessed that the ECB's strongly expansionary monetary policy – given the structural nature of weak economic growth and sluggish demand for credit – would prove ineffective in boosting economic growth in the euro area.",
        "Other Council members highlighted that although the scale of further quantitative easing by the ECB was unknown, it would last – according to the announcements of the ECB – for at least 2 years.",
        "Thus – they argued – the monetary policy in Poland's environment would remain highly expansionary for an extended period, which, assuming unchanged NBP interest rates, might be conducive to the inflow of short-term capital to Poland.",
        "However, a few Council members judged that the anticipated monetary policy tightening by the Federal Reserve could have more significant impact on financial markets – including the prices of Polish assets – than the monetary policy loosening by the ECB.",
        "Those members also underscored that in some emerging economies and developed economies which had been only slightly affected by the financial crisis, interest rates remained higher than in Poland.",
        "While discussing economic situation in Poland, Council members pointed out that economic growth had slowed down in recent months.",
        "Some Council members emphasised that economic activity had proved weaker than forecasted in the July projection of NPB.",
        "At the same time, those members pointed to the flagging industrial output growth, stagnant construction and assembly output as well as the PMI index running below 50 points.",
        "They also observed that economic activity growth in Poland had been dragged down by a strong fall in exports to the former Soviet Union countries and a marked weakening in exports growth to the euro area.",
        "They argued that while retail sales continued to rise, the pace of this growth was below that observed in the first half of 2014.",
        "They also expressed the opinion that the weakening of GDP growth might not be temporary, and a few of them believed that there was a risk of further decrease in GDP growth in subsequent quarters.",
        "In contrast, some Council members argued that economic growth had decelerated only slightly and its pace was currently close to potential output growth.",
        "They pointed to the gradually improving situation in the labour market, including a decline in the unemployment rate and further steady wage growth, which supported retail sales growth.",
        "They also argued that relatively robust economic activity was accompanied with sound financial situation of enterprises.",
        "A few of those Council members observed that both economic growth and domestic demand growth in Poland remained higher than forecasted a few quarters ago, when the Council had decided about the last interest rates cut.",
        "They also underlined that – according to the forecasts – GDP growth next year might be higher than this year.",
        "Some members of the Council pointed out that GDP growth in the coming year would be affected by fiscal policy.",
        "A few members of the Council were of the opinion that the increase in social spending announced by the government suggested that the coming year might bring greater than previously planned rise in public expenditures.",
        "A few Council members pointed also to a possible increase in expenditures co-financed with the European Union funds.",
        "Some Council members believed, however, that the government-announced increase in social spending would be small (about 0.2% of GDP), and the deficit in 2015 would remain close to its 2014 level.",
        "Moreover, part of the public expenditures would be related to a repayment of liabilities incurred a few years ago.",
        "They also argued that the possibility of fiscal policy easing was limited due to the excessive deficit procedure being in force.",
        "A few Council members assessed, however, that budget deficit in 2014 will be probably markedly lower than it was planned in the budget act, which will mean easing of fiscal policy in the next year.",
        "While analyzing the inflationary developments, members of the Council highlighted the fact that CPI inflation continued to run below zero.",
        "The majority of the Council members emphasized that no cost pressure had been seen in the economy, as evidenced by the negative growth in producer prices and persistently low wage growth.",
        "They also argued that there were no signs of demand pressure, as indicated by the negative retail sales deflator and core inflation persisting close to zero.",
        "They also pointed to continuing decline in inflation expectations.",
        "They drew attention to increase in risk of longer than previously expected period of inflation remaining below the target, as suggested by the revisions of inflation forecasts.",
        "According to some members of the Council, such a sharp decline in CPI inflation is largely supply driven, as evidenced by the deepening decline in food prices.",
        "They argued that the observed positive supply shocks improved the financial situation of enterprises and enhanced debt service capacity of economic agents.",
        "A few of them also pointed out that August brought a slight increase in one of the core inflation measures.",
        "While discussing NBP interest rates level, the majority of Council members believed that due to the sluggish economic activity, the risk of further weakening of economic growth, the deepening of the negative output gap and, consequently, higher risk of inflation remaining below target in the medium term, it was justified to cut interest rates significantly.",
        "They pointed to the signs of economic slowdown in Poland and its environment, further decline in prices and inflation expectations and the absence of wage pressure.",
        "At the same time, they emphasized that interest rate adjustment was necessary due to the increase in real interest rates resulting from the decline in inflation and inflation expectations observed in the past few quarters.",
        "In this context, they stressed that the current real interest rates had become relatively high as compared with those in the recent years.",
        "They also pointed out the lack of inflationary risks in the Poland's environment and the growing scale of monetary expansion in the euro area, leading to an increase in the disparity of interest rates in Poland as compared with its environment.",
        "Those members also emphasized that a moderate level of credit growth in the economy and the absence of signs of imbalance in the housing market limited risks to financial stability.",
        "These members also believed that due to lags in the transmission mechanism of monetary policy, the adjustment of NBP interest rates should be rather quick and significant.",
        "In this context, a few Council members assessed, that a significant interest rates cut would be justified if it was accompanied with the statement, that this decision denoted the one-off adjustment in the interest rates to the current economic forecasts.",
        "Some Council members believed, however, that NBP interest rates should remain unchanged.",
        "They pointed out that the slowdown in economic activity in the recent period was driven by factors beyond the impact of domestic monetary policy, namely external shocks and persistent uncertainty.",
        "Accordingly, in the current situation, monetary policy instruments might prove ineffective in stimulating economic activity.",
        "They argued that low inflation resulted mainly from supply shocks, which boosted real incomes of households and enterprises, and thus should not be offset by monetary policy.",
        "A few of those Council members also believed that lower interest rates were likely to slow down the process of corporate restructuring.",
        "Other Council members assessed, that interest rates cut would be justified only in the case of a considerable slowdown in economic growth.",
        "A few members of the Council additionally argued that interest rates cuts, through stimulating domestic demand, amidst weak demand abroad, could bring deterioration of the current account balance.",
        "Other members of the Council pointed out, however, that in the recent quarters Poland had experienced a trade surplus, and the current account deficit had been so far financed by foreign direct investment and the inflow of EU funds.",
        "A few Council members also underlined that interest rate cuts may contribute to the fall in deposits in the banking sector.",
        "Other Council members pointed out, however, that the sharp decline in deposits, and consequently, an increase in currency in circulation, would be a rather unlikely development in response to NBP interest rates cuts.",
        "They also emphasized that the possible conversion of deposits into cash by economic agents would not negatively affect the stability of the banking sector considering the persistently high liquidity surplus in the Polish banking sector.",
        "They underlined that deposits withdrawn from the banking sector could be spent on consumption and investments.",
        "The Council also discussed the width of the interest rate corridor of standing facilities.",
        "It was pointed out that should the reference rate be lowered, the current width of the corridor would be very large in relation to the basic interest rate level.",
        "It was also emphasized that the resulting reduction in the lombard rate would have an impact on the ceiling for the socalled maximum interest.",
        "The Council members also noted that should the reference rate and the rediscount rate be lowered, the interest on the required reserve – assuming it was computed using the current method – would be higher than the interest rate of basic open market operations.",
        "At the meeting a motion was submitted to lower NBP reference rate and NBP rediscount rate by 0.5 percentage points as well as a motion to lower NBP lombard rate by 1.0 percentage point.",
        "The motion was also submitted to change the remuneration on the required reserve funds to 0.9 of the reference rate.",
        "The Council set the NBP interest rates at the following levels: the reference rate at 2.00%, the lombard rate at 3.00%, the deposit rate at 1.00%, the rediscount rate at 2.25%.",
        "At its meeting, members of the Monetary Policy Council discussed the current and future monetary policy decisions against the background of macroeconomic developments in Poland and abroad and the July projection of inflation and GDP.",
        "While discussing business conditions abroad, Council members underlined that global activity growth remained moderate.",
        "It was emphasised that the recovery in the euro area continued at a slow pace, despite a certain improvement in the business climate in the peripheral economies of the monetary union.",
        "Some Council members also pointed out that following the data revision in the United States, 2014 Q1 GDP growth had been negative and weaker than originally estimated.",
        "Other Council members underlined, that the fall in GDP had been related to weather conditions and the second quarter should see a considerable rebound in GDP growth.",
        "With reference to the situation in major emerging economies, including Russia, it was indicated that economic activity growth in these countries remained slow.",
        "However, it was emphasised that recovery continued in countries of Central and Eastern Europe.",
        "At the meeting monetary policy in the external environment of the Polish economy was discussed.",
        "Attention was drawn to the easing of monetary policy by the European Central Bank (including interest rates cut and the introduction of a new liquidity provision to the banking system programme, conditional upon increased lending) and by some banks in emerging economies.",
        "It was emphasised that the ECB might announce further quantitative easing programmes in the subsequent quarters.",
        "Some Council members pointed out that the easing of monetary policy by the ECB increased the interest rate differential between Poland and majority of the countries in its environment as well as the importance of this differential for exchange rate developments.",
        "While discussing the effectiveness of the non-standard measures undertaken by the major central banks, some Council members were of the opinion that those measures allowed to meet the rising demand for liquidity from economic entities.",
        "It was argued that in the absence of those measures, the growth in economic activity in the largest economies would probably have been slower.",
        "Some Council members argued, however, that the effectiveness of the non-standard measures taken by the major central banks is low.",
        "Amidst still not fully restructured balance sheets in the banking sector and uncertainty persisting in the economy, this measures fail to boost lending and aggregate spending while producing an undesirable effect of excessive growth in the prices of some assets.",
        "Those members also pointed out that although quantitative easing provided liquidity to the economy and gave banks and enterprises time to restructure, the maintenance of interest rates close to zero undermined the incentives for restructuring.",
        "Council members also observed that the strongly expansionary monetary policy of the major central banks had not, as yet, driven up inflation to any significant degree, and that inflation in Poland's immediate environment remained very low.",
        "A few members argued that low inflation in the global economy might persist for a longer time, considering the limited demand growth and the absence of commodity price growth in the global markets.",
        "While discussing the economic situation in Poland, Council members emphasised that economic activity growth might have slowed down in the past few months, which might be partly – and in the assessment of a few Council members primarily – the effect of the conflict between Ukraine and Russia.",
        "The slowdown in economic activity growth was reflected in lower growth in industrial output, construction and assembly output as well as in retail sales.",
        "It was highlighted that some business climate indicators declined and employment growth in the corporate sector ground to a halt.",
        "The Council also underscored considerable uncertainty concerning the permanence of the recent slowdown in economic activity.",
        "A few Council members presented the view that the accelerating growth in lending suggested a continuation of the recovery in domestic demand in the subsequent months.",
        "At the same time they emphasised that as economic recovery continues, lending might accelerate further and exceed nominal GDP growth markedly.",
        "With reference to current inflation, it was observed that in May the annual consumer price growth had decreased again and was significantly below expectations.",
        "It was also emphasised that producer prices in industry in year-on-year terms continued to fall and that inflation expectations of households and enterprises remained low.",
        "It was argued that low inflation resulted not only from supply shocks (including the decline in fruit and vegetable prices), but also from moderate demand growth reflected in low levels of core inflation.",
        "Some members of the Council also pointed to a negative growth in import prices as an important source of low inflation in Poland.",
        "Some members of the Council noted that the lower than expected inflation was conducive to a rise in real interest rates.",
        "While analyzing the July projection of inflation and GDP, members of the Council pointed out that, although in the subsequent quarters GDP growth was not likely to accelerate significantly, it might exceed potential GDP growth.",
        "As a result, the output gap, which is now negative, should be gradually closing within the projection horizon.",
        "Some Council members underlined, however, that at the end of the projection horizon GDP growth would be close to potential output growth.",
        "Council members also pointed out that – in line with the projection – all the components of domestic demand as well as exports were supposed to rise and that a certain slowdown in investment growth at the end of the projection horizon might be driven by a reduction in the EU-financed public investment.",
        "It was emphasized that in line with the projection, economic recovery in the coming quarters would, to a certain extent, boost wage growth in the economy, which should, however, remain below the long-term average.",
        "It was pointed out, however, that wage growth is expected to outpace labour productivity growth, which would lead to a gradual increase in unit labour costs growth.",
        "Some Council members underlined that in the long-term projection horizon, the growth of unit labor costs could exceed the NBP inflation target.",
        "While analyzing the inflation projection, members of the Council emphasized that in the coming quarters inflation would be lower than expected in the March projection.",
        "They indicated that inflation might fall below zero in the coming months, and in the subsequent few quarters would continue to be very low.",
        "It was pointed out that inflation would rise close to the target at the end of the projection horizon.",
        "It was argued that, in line with the projection, the increase in inflation would be supported by the projected improvement in the labour market as well as a certain rise in food and energy prices.",
        "A few Council members pointed out, however, that a growth in those two price categories should be – according to the projection – lower than long term average.",
        "Referring to the possible effects of the expected temporary fall in inflation below zero in the coming months, a few members of the Council were of the opinion that it would boost the real purchasing power of consumers and expand consumer demand.",
        "Other members of the Council believed that the likely fall in inflation below zero could prompt households to postpone consumption.",
        "Those members were of the opinion, that present interest rates level under current macroeconomic developments could deepen deflation.",
        "Members of the Council pointed to the risks associated with the projection of inflation.",
        "Some of them emphasized that the distribution of risks in the projection was asymmetric and the probability of inflation running below the central path was higher than the probability of inflation running above the path.",
        "However a few members of the Council were of the opinion that higher than assumed energy prices, possibly being the result of the Middle East conflict, might be a risk factor for higher inflation.",
        "Other Council members argued that core inflation in the projection rose to a level which in the past had occurred only when CPI inflation had been higher than the upper limit for deviations from the inflation target.",
        "The Council decided that the NBP interest rates should remain unchanged at the current meeting.",
        "The rationale for this decision was the ongoing economic recovery, which should contribute to inflation rising close to the NBP inflation target over the projection horizon.",
        "Yet, Council members were of the opinion that there persisted uncertainty regarding a possible deterioration in the business climate and the pace of return of inflation to the target.",
        "Therefore, a few Council members pointed out that interest rate decrease could be necessary in the near future.",
        "The Council was of the opinion, that decisions in the coming months should depend on the assessment of incoming data from the point of view of the prospects for further economic recovery and inflation developments in the medium term.",
        "At its meeting, members of the Monetary Policy Council discussed the current and future monetary policy decisions against the background of global and domestic macroeconomic developments and the March projection of inflation and GDP.",
        "Referring to the situation abroad, the Council pointed out that the recovery in the global economy is still moderate.",
        "It was emphasised that activity growth in the United States may recently have lost some momentum, and GDP growth in 2013 Q4 has been revised downward.",
        "At the same time, it was assessed that a certain deterioration in the US data may be partly due to unfavourable weather conditions.",
        "Council members highlighted further improvement in the business climate in the euro area, where economic growth is nevertheless unstable and much weaker than that in the United States.",
        "It was also observed that inflation in the euro area has remained low.",
        "Referring to the situation in the emerging economies, some Council members observed that business climate indicators for China, the largest emerging economy, point to a slowdown in activity growth at the beginning of 2014.",
        "Yet, a few Council members argued that activity growth in many Central and Eastern European countries has been accelerating.",
        "Council member expressed the opinion that heightened uncertainty related to future developments in Ukraine poses a risk to the economic situation in Poland's external environment.",
        "It was indicated that possible escalation of the conflict between Ukraine and Russia may undermine Poland's trade with the Eastern markets and dampen business sentiment and firms' propensity to invest.",
        "At the same time, it was judged that the potential weakening in Poland's exports to the Eastern markets, particularly food exports, could curb price growth in the domestic market.",
        "Yet, a few Council members argued that the risk related to future developments in the East may support the recently observed slight increase in global commodity prices and deterioration of the sentiment in the financial markets.",
        "In this context, other Council members observed that the recent hike in commodity prices may have been a temporary phenomenon, while the slowing demand in China could contribute to lower commodity prices in the longer term.",
        "Addressing economic conditions in Poland, Council members underlined accelerating GDP growth in 2013 Q4.",
        "As expected, output growth was supported by higher domestic demand growth, primarily in terms of consumption, and – to a very small extent – investment.",
        "Yet, it was net exports that continued to be the main driver of GDP growth.",
        "Council members emphasised that monthly data from the beginning of the year point to a continued gradual recovery in the economy.",
        "In particular, retail sales and industrial production continued to rise, however a fall in construction and assembly output was also mentioned.",
        "Council members assessed that economic recovery is not accompanied by accumulation of any significant macroeconomic imbalances; the current account balance is improving.",
        "A few Council members also highlighted that the economic rebound has been accompanied by a stable growth in lending to the private sector.",
        "While analysing the situation in the labour market, the signs of improvement, albeit a sluggish one, were observed.",
        "It was mentioned, that according to LFS, the number of working persons rose slightly in 2013 Q4, which contributed to a certain decline in the unemployment rate (in annual terms).",
        "It was, however, pointed out that in January employment growth in the corporate sector was halted.",
        "A few Council members, on the other hand, pointed to a rising number of job offers and falling likelihood of losing a job, which suggests continued improvement in the situation in this market in the following quarters.",
        "However, it was emphasised that the unemployment rate has persisted at elevated levels, thus hampering wage pressure in the economy.",
        "The absence of wage pressure is confirmed by a slowdown in both wage and unit labour cost growth in 2013 Q4.",
        "Council members emphasised that the observed gradual recovery is not translating into higher inflationary pressure in the economy.",
        "It was observed that in January inflation remained stable and well below the target, while core inflation decreased.",
        "The absence of inflationary pressure is also signalled by negative growth of producer prices, amidst low inflation expectations of economic agents.",
        "A few Council members pointed out at this point that the annual consumer price growth is boosted, at the beginning of the year, by the statistical base effects.",
        "While analysing the outlook for economic growth, Council members assessed that in the next few quarters economic recovery will probably continue at the pace envisaged in the March projection.",
        "It was emphasised that GDP growth will be supported by the revival in consumer demand.",
        "It was pointed out that in line with the projection, investment may be expected to pick up, especially in terms of corporate investment.",
        "Yet, a few Council members argued that corporate business activity may be weakened by the growing tax burden imposed on businesses by local government units.",
        "Council members expressed the opinion that despite stronger economic growth, inflation – in light of the March projection – will return to the target only gradually, and will remain below the target at least throughout this year.",
        "Some Council members also invoked external forecasts pointing to the same scenario.",
        "In this context, those members highlighted the fact that – according to the projection – the expected gradual return of inflation to the target will be related to the narrowing of the output gap and its subsequent stabilisation at a positive, yet close to zero level.",
        "Council members observed that in line with the projection, wage and unit labour costs will accelerate, yet their growth will not be strong enough to jeopardise the inflation target in the medium term.",
        "A few Council members also observed that the March projection – in comparison with the November one – expects lower inflation this year, coupled with higher forecasts of GDP growth.",
        "They argued that the persistence of inflation below the target during this year will result, to a large extent, from the impact of factors beyond the direct influence of the domestic monetary policy, including slow energy price growth.",
        "As a result, in the case of higher than assumed in the current projection energy price growth in subsequent quarters, inflation may return to the target faster than anticipated in the projection.",
        "Those members also highlighted that resulting from the projection increase in ratio of labour costs to corporate revenues may contribute to lower price competitiveness of Polish enterprises in the international markets.",
        "In this context, they pointed out that the recovery may be conducive to the inflow of capital and appreciation of the exchange rate, which would further limit price competitiveness of Polish enterprises.",
        "As a result, factors of production might be shifted towards the non-tradable sector – including residential construction – posing, amidst low interest rates, a risk of imbalances arising in this sector.",
        "Therefore, a few Council members were of the opinion that an interest rate increase may be justified, even if inflation remains below the target.",
        "Yet, other Council members held the view that a significant interest rate rise aimed at curbing the risk of imbalances in the real estate market may come at a higher cost to the economy as a whole than the application of macroprudential instruments.",
        "They also underlined that the gradual decrease of the LtV ratio in mortgage loans this year and in the following years applied by the Financial Supervision Authority should limit the risk of accumulation of significant imbalances in the real estate market.",
        "The Council decided that the NBP interest rates should remain unchanged at the current meeting.",
        "The Council discussed the indicated period of the probable maintenance of the NBP interest rates at an unchanged level.",
        "Some Council members were of the opinion that, given the March projection, which pointed to a very gradual return of inflation to the target, it may be justified to keep the interest rates unchanged until the end of 2014.",
        "One of the factors justifying the extended period of interest rate stabilisation was – in the opinion of some Council members – the need to limit economic uncertainty under mounting international risk related to the tensions emerging in the East.",
        "Some Council members emphasised that owing to the uncertainty about future macroeconomic developments abroad, including in Ukraine, the indicated period of the probable maintenance of NBP interest rate should not be longer than before.",
        "A few of these Council members also believed that a shorter indicated period of no interest rate change may also be justified by the ongoing economic recovery and the risk of an earlier than projected return of inflation to the target.",
        "As a result of the discussion, the Council assessed that the current and expected economic situation, including the results of the March projection of inflation and GDP justify maintenance of the NBP interest rates at an unchanged level over a longer period of time, i.e.",
        "at least until the end of the third quarter of 2014.",
        "The Council left the basic interest rates unchanged at the following levels: reference rate at 2.50%, lombard rate at 4.00%, deposit rate at 1.00%, rediscount rate at 2.75%.",
        "At its meeting, members of the Monetary Policy Council discussed the current and future monetary policy decisions in the context of macroeconomic developments in Poland and abroad.",
        "While discussing external developments, Council members pointed to a gradual improvement in business conditions.",
        "It was noted that after growth in the United States had come to a halt in early 2014, the latest data pointed to a rebound of economic activity.",
        "In addition, it was highlighted that – although the Federal Reserve was gradually reducing the scale of its asset purchases – monetary policy in the United States continued to be very accommodative.",
        "Council members also pointed out that a gradual recovery continued in the euro area.",
        "It was emphasised that recovery in Germany – Poland's main trading partner – was somewhat stronger than in other euro area member states.",
        "However, weaker March industrial orders and business sentiment in Germany were brought to attention.",
        "It was also noted that sentiment in the financial markets of the euro area countries most severely affected by the debt crisis had improved, which should translate into easier access to credit, and further into a gradual improvement in economic conditions in some of these countries.",
        "Council members emphasised that inflation in many countries, including in particular in the euro area, remained low despite the ongoing economic recovery.",
        "This may convince major central banks, including the ECB, to continue their accommodative monetary policies.",
        "A few Council members expressed the opinion that deflation in the euro area was increasingly less likely, as indicated by the upward revisions of some inflation forecasts for the euro area.",
        "These members also highlighted the risks to longerterm growth sustainability associated with further monetary policy easing by the ECB.",
        "In their discussion on developments in the external environment of the Polish economy, a few Council members cited factors which could potentially be conducive to lower growth in developed countries in the coming years, particularly in the euro area.",
        "These factors included possible further fiscal consolidation, ageing population and a decline in investment outlays, including for R&D, in developed countries following the global financial crisis.",
        "Furthermore, a few Council members indicated that attempts by Chinese authorities to rebalance economic growth in China away from investments might weaken demand for Chinese imports of investment goods from developed countries, particularly from Germany.",
        "Referring to economic conditions in emerging market economies, it was noted that Chinese growth had weakened in 2014 Q1.",
        "Attention was also drawn to a deterioration in economic outlook for Ukraine and Russia, which was related to the Ukrainian crisis.",
        "While discussing the impact of the Ukrainian crisis on the Polish economy, the majority of the Council members judged that the mounting turmoil in Ukraine continued to pose a source of uncertainty for Polish economic growth outlook.",
        "They pointed out that a weaker economic growth outlook in Russia and Ukraine and a depreciation of their currencies might undermine Poland's trade with the Eastern markets.",
        "However, a few Council members were of the opinion that – given that Poland's trade with these markets was limited, and some of these exports could be redirected to other markets – the Ukrainian crisis would have a limited impact on Polish foreign trade, and in consequence, on economic growth in Poland.",
        "Council members also highlighted that the impact of the Ukrainian crisis on the sentiment in the international financial markets and the zloty exchange rate had been limited so far.",
        "While discussing recent data releases in Poland, Council members pointed to ongoing growth in industrial output and retail sales as well as improved construction sector performance, all of which confirms continued recovery in domestic demand.",
        "It was indicated that, in contrast to earlier estimates, domestic demand had been the main driver of growth already in 2014 Q4, which had been – among others – due to much faster than expected rebound of investment spending.",
        "Yet, it was also emphasized that recent data on economic activity had been lower than expected and in some cases, including retail sales growth, export orders and leading indicators of business sentiment, had weakened.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members, the deterioration in sentiment could have been related with higher uncertainty due to an escalation of the conflict in Ukraine and weaker economic growth outlook in the trading partners in the East.",
        "Council members noted that the rebound of economic activity was translating into improvement in labour market conditions.",
        "Employment in the corporate sector is gradually expanding, with a concurrent decline in unemployment.",
        "Yet it was emphasised that the unemployment rate persisted at an elevated level, which constrained wage pressure, as confirmed by slow unit labour cost growth.",
        "However, a few Council members expressed the opinion that – like in the previous recoveries – unit labour cost might be expected to pick up in the coming quarters, citing an acceleration in wage growth in recent months.",
        "On the other hand, some Council members argued that business conditions surveys did not point to an acceleration of wage growth in the near future.",
        "Some Council members pointed to a slight improvement in lending growth, supported by low loan costs.",
        "At the same time, a few Council members drew attention to a low share of investment loans in financing of investment projects by small and medium-sized enterprises.",
        "Other Council members assessed that low interest on deposits continues to undermine the incentives to save in the banking system, which was reflected in increasingly weaker growth in corporate deposits.",
        "In their discussion on inflation developments, Council members pointed to inflation remaining markedly below the NBP inflation target and still low core inflation, despite a rise in one of its measures.",
        "It was also emphasised that producer prices continued to decrease, and that inflation expectations remained low.",
        "Some Council members noted that the available forecasts pointed to a slightly slower rise in inflation in the coming months than envisaged in the March projection.",
        "Taking this into account, a few Council members expressed the opinion that inflation might return to the target later than forecasted in the March projection.",
        "Some Council members presented the view that accelerated economic growth might translate into a rise in inflation to a greater extent than currently forecasted.",
        "Moreover, a few Council members noted that the situation in Ukraine and the adverse weather conditions in many major food commodity exporters resulted in a considerable rise in their prices in the global markets.",
        "This is conducive to faster food price growth, whose deceleration – along with slow energy price growth – was previously one of the key factors keeping inflation down.",
        "The Council decided that the NBP interest rates should remain unchanged at the current meeting.",
        "Furthermore, the Council maintained its assessment that the NBP interest rates should be kept unchanged for a longer period of time, i.e.",
        "at least until the end of the third quarter of 2014.",
        "The Council members observed that a more comprehensive assessment of macroeconomic outlook needed to change the horizon of keeping the interest rates at the current level will probably be possible during the July meeting of the Council, when a new NBP projection is to be presented.",
        "The Council left the key NBP interest rates unchanged at the following levels: reference rate at 2.50%, lombard rate at 4.00%, deposit rate at 1.00%, rediscount rate at 2.75%.",
        "At its meeting, members of the Monetary Policy Council discussed the current and future monetary policy decisions in the context of macroeconomic developments in Poland and abroad.",
        "While discussing external developments, Council members indicated that growth in global activity remained moderate, but economic conditions varied across countries.",
        "Some Council members emphasized that recent data on activity in the major economies had been weaker than expected.",
        "In particular, in the United States GDP unexpectedly fell in the first quarter, albeit probably only temporarily.",
        "In the euro area, GDP growth was low, and some economic indicators pointed to a slowdown in recovery in the manufacturing sector in May 2014.",
        "During discussion of the euro area, some Council members pointed to a dispersion in economic growth rates within the region.",
        "In Italy GDP declined in 2014 Q1, and in France output did not change.",
        "At the same time, in Germany – Poland’s main trading partner – economic growth accelerated.",
        "A few Council members cited downside risks for German exports: still relatively low economic growth in China and economic slowdown in Russia.",
        "Some Council members also emphasized that the weakening of the Polish trade with Russia and Ukraine, recorded already in 2013, had intensified in the first months of 2014.",
        "While discussing monetary policy abroad, Council members pointed out that the ECB had hinted it might ease its monetary policy at the June meeting.",
        "Some Council members emphasized that although the Federal Reserve was slowly reducing the scale of quantitative easing, monetary policy was still highly expansionary also in the United States.",
        "They also indicated that monetary policy in Central and Eastern Europe remained accommodative, and the National Bank of Hungary (MNB) had recently decreased its base rate to 2.4%.",
        "A few Council members emphasized that even though monetary policy of many central banks had been expansionary in recent years, inflation remained low worldwide.",
        "When discussing inflation developments abroad, Council members pointed out that inflation in the euro area was still low, not only owing to a fall in food and energy price index, but also due to low core inflation.",
        "It was noted that inflation in the euro area remained well below the ECB’s definition of price stability.",
        "In this context, the opinion was expressed that persistence of low inflation impeded deleveraging in the euro area member states most severely affected by the debt crisis.",
        "It was also highlighted that inflation in Central and Eastern Europe had also declined in recent months to only slightly above zero, or even reaching negative levels.",
        "It was pointed out that a decline in CPI inflation in Central and Eastern Europe over recent months was – like in the euro area – accompanied by a fall in core inflation.",
        "Referring to the economic conditions in Poland, Council members indicated that GDP growth in 2014 Q1 had been close to the March projection and confirmed a gradual recovery of the Polish economy.",
        "Attention was paid to the favourable composition of GDP growth.",
        "In particular, there was an acceleration in domestic demand, especially investment demand, while foreign trade continued to record a surplus.",
        "However, some Council members pointed out that some indicators of activity in manufacturing sector had levelled off due to weakening in orders, employment and output sub-indices.",
        "In the opinion of these Council members, a decline in some economic indicators may reflect risks to further recovery of the Polish economy.",
        "A few Council members noted that investment in Poland remained weak in relation to GDP compared to other countries in Central and Eastern Europe.",
        "They also indicated that the share of private investment was low compared to other EU member states.",
        "In this context, it was noted that corporate lending, including for investments, had rebounded.",
        "Council members highlighted that the recovery in economic activity was translating into an improvement in the labour market conditions.",
        "Employment in the Polish economy is slowly rising, and unemployment is falling.",
        "It was emphasized that – in spite of a gradual recovery in the labour market – wage pressure remained limited, owing to a concurrent rise in labour force participation.",
        "While discussing inflation developments, Council members pointed out that inflation had decreased in April, remaining markedly below the inflation target and considerably below the March projection.",
        "A fall in inflation in April was due to a decline in core inflation and falling food price growth.",
        "Some Council members indicated that a decline in inflation in recent months was driven by a fall in prices of an increasing number of goods.",
        "A few Council members also drew attention to continued fall in producer prices, decline in retail sales prices and further decrease in import prices.",
        "With regard to expected inflation developments in months ahead, Council members pointed out that according to several short-term forecasts, inflation was likely to remain below the March projection.",
        "Some Council members also emphasized that – according to available forecasts – the probability of a temporary fall in inflation below zero in summer had risen.",
        "It was also noted that long-term breakeven inflation expectations had fallen.",
        "A few Council members, however, were of the opinion that – if the current pace of economic growth continued – a revival in demand pressure would be conducive to higher inflation.",
        "They also argued that due to reduced oil production in some countries, oil prices could rise in the coming period.",
        "The Council decided that the NBP interest rates should remain unchanged at the current meeting.",
        "The Council maintained its assessment that the NBP interest rates should be kept unchanged until the end of 2014 Q3.",
        "While discussing future decisions, the majority of Council members pointed out that the expected inflation was lower than in the March projection, while uncertainty had risen, particularly with respect to the pace of economic recovery in the coming quarters and the outlook for monetary policy abroad.",
        "Given this, Council members observed that a more comprehensive assessment of the monetary policy perspectives and potential adjustment of interest rates would be possible after the Council got acquainted with incoming information, including the July NBP projection.",
        "The Council left the key NBP interest rates unchanged at the following levels: reference rate at 2.50%, lombard rate at 4.00%, deposit rate at 1.00%, rediscount rate at 2.75%.",
        "At the same time, a few Council members were of the opinion that a rebound in economic activity in the United States since 2014 Q2 might translate into global economic recovery, including in the emerging market economies.",
        "As a result, this could have a positive impact on activity of the German economy, and consequently on activity of the Polish economy.",
        "It was pointed out at the meeting that inflation in the euro area had declined near zero.",
        "A few Council members expressed a view that low inflation would – through lower indexation of household incomes – affect demand growth and contribute to extending the period of stagnation in the euro area.",
        "Council members pointed out that since the Council’s previous meeting, expectations of additional monetary easing by the European Central Bank had increased.",
        "Attention was also drawn to interest rate cuts in economies having strong links to the euro area, as well as rising interest rate differential between Poland and its immediate environment.",
        "While discussing the economic conditions in Poland, it was emphasized that incoming data point to a decline in economic growth.",
        "Although the annual growth rate of GDP in 2014 Q2 decreased slightly, it was supported to a large extent by a built-up in inventories amidst a decline in net exports and growth in investment.",
        "According to some Council members, this may indicate a risk of adjustment in production in the coming quarters to a decrease in sales growth.",
        "Weakening economic activity is also confirmed by the data on industrial production and leading industrial indicators, which in the recent months were significantly lower than a few months ago.",
        "Moreover, it was stressed that consumer sentiment had declined in the recent period and construction and assembly output growth was came almost to a halt in July.",
        "Some Council members also indicated that the pace of recovery in the labour market slowed down as well, as shown by a decrease in employment growth, wage growth and unit labour costs in 2014 Q2.",
        "A few Council members, however, expressed the opinion that elevated uncertainty associated with the escalation of the crisis in Ukraine could have been a major factor behind weakening investment growth in 2012 Q2 and deterioration in economic indicators in the recent period.",
        "Therefore, the persistence of the weakening in economic indicators and investment growth is hard to assess.",
        "Some Council members assessed that the economic growth could stay close to previous quarters.",
        "They indicated that a slight acceleration in private consumption growth in 2014 Q2 and a certain increase in retail sales in July pointed to a continued increase in consumer demand.",
        "The rise in consumer demand is supported by the ongoing recovery in the labour market and a steady increase in real wages amidst very low price growth.",
        "A few Council members also pointed to a certain growth in industrial production in July.",
        "Referring to the current price developments, it was pointed out that annual inflation had fallen below zero in July, which had been in line with the July projection, although clearly below the expectations formed several quarters earlier.",
        "It was emphasized that the decline in inflation below zero was due to a negative growth of food prices amidst stagnant energy prices.",
        "At the same time, attention was drawn to the lack of demand pressure confirmed by historically low values of all core inflation measures and the persistence of negative growth of retail sales deflator.",
        "It was also indicated that despite recovery in the labour market, there was no wage pressure in the economy.",
        "Neither were there any cost pressures, as confirmed by a two-year decline in producer prices.",
        "It was pointed out that a significant decline in inflation and inflation expectations was conducive to rising real interest rates, despite a stabilization of nominal interest rates.",
        "With regard to the economic growth outlook, Council members assessed that, similarly to 2014 Q2, economic growth in the coming quarters is likely to be lower than expected in the July projection, although – as pointed by a few Council members – will remain close to early 2014.",
        "Lower GDP growth than in the July projection is indicated mainly by weaker economic conditions in the environment of the Polish economy.",
        "Council members also emphasized that declining sentiment of domestic economic agents driven by growing uncertainty about developments in Ukraine might limit domestic activity.",
        "While analyzing the outlook for inflation in the coming months, it was pointed out that in the following months it would probably be slightly lower than in the July projection.",
        "Lower inflation than expected in July will most likely be driven by a stronger decline in food prices (due to embargo imposed on Polish fruit and vegetables and reduced food commodity prices in the international markets), as well as weaker demand pressure associated with slower economic growth than expected in July.",
        "Some Council members also indicated that the expected persistence of very low inflation in the euro area would – through strong trade ties with the euro area – add to a reduction in price pressure in Poland.",
        "At the same time it was pointed out that – in line with available forecasts – inflation would rise above zero already in 2014, probably on the back of a higher growth rate of energy prices and food price growth rate turning positive.",
        "While discussing decision on interest rates, the majority of Council members assessed that in the near future it would probably be justified to adjust the level of NBP interest rates.",
        "In their opinion, signs of economic slowdown in Poland and abroad, an absence of price pressure and increased risk of inflation remaining below the target in the medium term, as well as monetary policy easing in the euro area, are factors in favour of lowering interest rates.",
        "These members also assessed that, given moderate economic growth and persisting uncertainty, a risk of macroeconomic imbalances build-up following a probable decrease in interest rates was small.",
        "Some Council members considered that NBP interest rates should be reduced already at the current meeting.",
        "They argued that – considering a rise in risk of economic slowdown and inflation remaining well below the target in Poland in the coming quarters – it was justified to lower interest rates as soon as possible.",
        "Other Council members pointed to uncertainty about the persistence of economic slowdown and developments in the East, which justified – in their opinion – keeping interest rates unchanged at the current meeting.",
        "They also noted that in previous meetings the Council had signalled a stabilization of the interest rates till the end of 2014 Q3.",
        "At the same time, they emphasized that if the incoming data failed to alter significantly the assessment of economic conditions and inflation developments, it would be justified to begin monetary policy adjustment at the following meeting.",
        "Yet, some Council members assessed that the adjustment of monetary policy in Poland was not currently justified.",
        "In their opinion, despite signs of economic slowdown, it is possible that the economic growth will remain stable in the coming quarters.",
        "They pointed out that given high uncertainty, the impact of interest rate changes on decision-taking by economic agents was limited.",
        "In their view, given limited demand for corporate loans, additional monetary stimulus would have little impact on corporate lending.",
        "In addition, they argued that any exchange rate depreciation – accompanying interest rate cuts – would affect purchasing power of households with liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.",
        "They also pointed out that should the uncertainty diminish, a reduction in interest rates might be conducive to emergence of macroeconomic imbalances.",
        "At the meeting a motion was submitted to lower NBP interest rates by 0.50 percentage points.",
        "The motion did not pass.",
        "A motion was also submitted to lower NBP interest rates by 0.25 percentage points.",
        "The motion did not pass.",
        "The Council decided to keep NBP interest rates at the following levels: the reference rate at 2.50%, the lombard rate at 4.00%, the deposit rate at 1.00%, the rediscount rate at 2.75%.",
        "At its meeting, members of the Monetary Policy Council discussed the current and future monetary policy decisions in the context of macroeconomic developments in Poland and abroad.",
        "While discussing the economic activity abroad, it was pointed out that the global economic conditions were gradually improving.",
        "Council members emphasized that the scale of this improvement remained diversified, but the magnitude of this diversification was different than in previous years.",
        "There have been signs that economy is recovering in developed countries.",
        "Meanwhile, economic growth in emerging market economies is low as for these countries.",
        "In the United States, a marked acceleration in economic growth and declining unemployment rate (partly due to a decrease in the number of economically active persons) have prompted the Federal Reserve to start reducing the scale of quantitative easing.",
        "At the same time, the Federal Reserve extended the suggested horizon for keeping interest rates near zero.",
        "In the euro area, in turn, the sentiment of economic agents has improved.",
        "This improvement has so far not been coupled with a marked acceleration in economic growth.",
        "As no demand pressure is expected in the euro area, the European Central Bank has maintained its commitment to keep the interest rates at present or lower level.",
        "In this context, some Council members highlighted that the European banking sector was still in a difficult position.",
        "They indicated that by dampening lending growth in the euro area it contained GDP growth in the region.",
        "However, it was emphasized that economic conditions in Germany - Poland's main trading partner - remained sound compared to the rest of the euro area.",
        "At this point, it was highlighted that economic conditions in other countries of Central and Eastern Europe, which also have close links with the German economy, continued to improve.",
        "Nevertheless, it was noted that forecasts for Germany did not explicitly indicate that economic growth was recovering at a significant pace.",
        "While discussing the situation in the environment of the Polish economy, it was also noted that global inflation was low.",
        "Low inflation is supported by moderate global economic activity and stabilisation of global commodity prices, especially for energy, underpinned by structural changes in the oil and natural gas markets.",
        "A few Council members assessed that in the coming years commodity prices could stabilize or fall.",
        "When discussing developments in the financial markets, some Council members pointed out that the Federal Reserve’s decision to reduce the scale of quantitative easing in the United States contributed to a slight increase in the volatility of asset prices in a number of emerging market economies.",
        "These members also pointed out that the prices of Polish assets had remained stable, which might indicate that fundamentals of the Polish economy are perceived positively by the markets.",
        "Referring to domestic economic activity, a few Council members assessed that the recovery in the following quarters would be substantial and might close the output gap relatively fast.",
        "Some Council members indicated that retail sales and industrial output growth (adjusted for seasonal and calendar factors) had accelerated, while the decline in construction and assembly output had narrowed.",
        "Council members also pointed out that fiscal policy would be an important factor influencing the pace of GDP growth in 2014 and the subsequent years.",
        "A few Council members were of the opinion that there was a risk of some relaxation in the public sector wage discipline in the coming years.",
        "Other Council members argued that an acceleration in growth of government expenditure was rather unlikely in the following years due to ongoing Excessive Deficit Procedure for Poland.",
        "It was in particular highlighted that there was a risk of a decrease in EU fund inflows should measures to reduce the public sector imbalance came to a halt.",
        "While discussing the likely structure of GDP growth in Poland in the following quarters, a few Council members emphasised that while Polish exports were supported by the high price competitiveness of Polish businesses to a great extent, the contribution of net exports to GDP growth might be expected to decrease due to an acceleration in consumer demand growth and an increase in gross fixed capital formation.",
        "In particular, some Council members pointed out that the NBP surveys indicated an improvement in forecasts of corporate performance, including higher propensity to invest of businesses, which may be a sign of revival in domestic demand.",
        "Yet, other Council members indicated that growth in investment lending was still slow.",
        "While assessing credit market conditions, Council members noted that the corporate lending was still low.",
        "This, however, is accompanied by accelerating consumer lending growth and a sustained increase in mortgage lending for households.",
        "In their discussion on the banking sector conditions, a few Council members indicated that the pace of household deposit growth continued to decelerate.",
        "While discussing economic growth, Council members were also referring to long term challenges relating to structural and regional policy and to the competitiveness of Polish enterprises.",
        "In this context, a few Council members highlighted that an increase in the EU funds share in co-financing research and development projects might be favourable for the Polish economy.",
        "When discussing current labour market conditions, Council members pointed out that the unemployment rate was still elevated, which hampered wage growth and decreased the chance of a significant recovery in consumption.",
        "According to a few Council members, the economic recovery was still not robust enough to bring about a significant employment growth.",
        "However, a few Council members assessed that – as business climate continued to improve – demand for labour was likely to grow at a stronger pace, which was also reflected in NBP surveys.",
        "However, these surveys do not indicate a risk of a marked acceleration in corporate wage growth.",
        "A few Council members also noted that an increase in minimum wage at the beginning of this year, and the related increase in some social benefits indexed to minimum wage, might be conducive to an increase in consumer demand.",
        "It was, however, argued that the rise in productivity, which is typical of this stage of recovery, mitigated the risk of excessive cost pressures in the labour market in the coming quarters.",
        "With reference to price developments, Council members indicated that in November the CPI index decreased and that inflation was still markedly below the target.",
        "Other signs of weak demand and cost pressure include low core inflation and declining producer prices in industry.",
        "Council members also pointed to continuously low inflation expectations of household and corporate sectors and the inflation forecasts of financial sector analysts.",
        "Council members emphasised that in light of available forecasts the 2014 inflation would stay below the November projection.",
        "Nonetheless, in the first two quarters of 2014 the CPI index may increase moderately due to base effects.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members, inflation would stay below the target not only because of low demand pressure, but also due to stabilisation in energy prices.",
        "Yet, other Council members pointed to the factors which, in their opinion, could be conducive to higher inflation in the near future.",
        "These involve growing demand pressure and a raise in local taxes, as well as higher prices of gas and some services related to the general government sector.",
        "The Council decided that the NBP interest rates should remain unchanged at the current meeting.",
        "Furthermore, the Council maintained its assessment that the gradual improvement in economic conditions was likely to continue over the coming quarters, while inflation pressure would remain limited.",
        "In this context, the Council confirmed that it would be justified to maintain the interest rates at the current level at least until the end of the first half of 2014.",
        "At the same time, Council members recognized that the findings of the March NBP projection would enable a more comprehensive assessment on the horizon of keeping the interest rates at the current level.",
        "The Council left the basic interest rates unchanged at the following levels: reference rate at 2.50%, lombard rate at 4.00%, deposit rate at 1.00%, rediscount rate at 2.75%."

    "2022": [
        "At the Council meeting, it was observed that after a strong growth of global economy in 2021, at the beginning of 2022 economic activity has softened somewhat in some countries, amid a surge in the pandemic.",
        "However, it was noted that along with the improving epidemic situation in the United States and the euro area, economic sentiment indicators in these economies had picked up, signalling improving conditions, both in the industrial and the services sector.",
        "During the meeting it was stressed that after the outbreak of the Russian military aggression against Ukraine, uncertainty regarding further course of global macroeconomic situation had increased significantly, including in Europe.",
        "It was assessed that Russian aggression and the related economic sanctions would contribute to slowing down the activity growth in many economies.",
        "Yet the scale of the impact would depend on the duration and course of the aggression, the range of sanctions imposed and the way economic agents adapt to these conditions.",
        "It was pointed out that the Russian military aggression against Ukraine had contributed to a marked deterioration of sentiment in global financial markets, which had a downward effect on the prices of many assets and led to a depreciation of many currencies, including those of the Central and Eastern Europe region.",
        "This was accompanied by another strong increase in global commodity prices related to the expected reduction in supply of commodities from Russia and Ukraine.",
        "In particular, it was pointed out that at the beginning of March the prices of gas in Europe were more than twice as high as in January, and that Brent oil prices had temporarily reached the highest level since 2008.",
        "Coal prices had also risen sharply.",
        "At the same time, the prices of agricultural commodities – including wheat and maize – also markedly increased.",
        "It was observed that the upward pressure on the prices of agricultural commodities would be driven not only by their limited supply from Russia and Ukraine, but also by rising prices of nitrogenous fertilisers which are produced using natural gas.",
        "It was also pointed out that international transport prices were still elevated, and that disruptions in global supply chains continued and might be intensified by Russian military aggression against Ukraine.",
        "In the opinion of the Council, amid the Russian military aggression against Ukraine the risk of further rise in global inflation, including in the external environment of the Polish economy, has grown.",
        "It was observed that already before the start of the Russian aggression, inflation in many countries had reached its highest levels in decades.",
        "In the euro area, HICP inflation rose to 5.8% in February, and in the United States, CPI inflation rose to 7.5% in January.",
        "It was pointed out that the accelerated price growth in these economies resulted mainly from supply-side factors – including, in particular, more expensive commodities – yet the recovery in demand and low unemployment level had been also driving the prices upwards, leading to a significant increase in core inflation.",
        "The Council members indicated that amidst a marked increase in inflation, many central banks were withdrawing monetary accommodation.",
        "It was highlighted that the central banks in Central and Eastern Europe continued to raise interest rates, and that the ECB kept negative interest rates, although it had been reducing the scale of asset purchases.",
        "It was also pointed out that the US Federal Reserve had signalled the termination of asset purchases in March and a start of interest rate increases.",
        "When analysing the situation in the Polish economy, Council members pointed out that according to available data, the economic situation remained favourable.",
        "It was observed that GDP growth in 2021 Q4 amounted to 7.3% according to preliminary estimate by Statistics Poland, on the back of a marked increase in consumption and investment.",
        "It was emphasised that the favourable economic conditions had continued into early 2022, as evidenced by a rapid growth in retail sales and industrial output.",
        "At the same time, attention was drawn to the favourable situation in the labour market, reflected in a further increase in employment and a marked increase in the average wage in the corporate sector, although wages were growing slightly slower in January than in December 2021.",
        "It was indicated that Russian military aggression against Ukraine and the related sanctions would have a negative impact on economic activity in Poland, although the scale of this impact was surrounded with considerable uncertainty.",
        "It was pointed out that a decline in exports to Russia, Belarus and Ukraine would have a dampening effect on GDP growth.",
        "Yet, it was indicated that this influence was bound to be limited due to the small share of exports to these economies in Poland’s foreign trade.",
        "However, it was noted that exports to other economies may also slow down, due to the intensified disruptions in supply chains and subdued growth of external demand due to a probable weakening of the economic conditions in countries that are Poland’s main trading partners.",
        "In addition, activity growth may be slowed down by a moderation in private sector investment – given the heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook – and slower consumption growth amid persistently higher inflation.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that in the aftermath of Russian aggression against Ukraine, some factors will support activity growth in Poland.",
        "In this context, attention was drawn to the considerable inflow of refugees to Poland, which would generate additional demand for consumer goods and services and would require higher investments related to the migrants, including investment in expanding the health care system, education and increasing the availability of housing.",
        "It was also pointed out that defence spending would be increased.",
        "Moreover, Council members observed that the inflow of refugees would contribute to increasing supply in the domestic labour market.",
        "The majority of the Council members observed that despite the negative impact of Russian aggression against Ukraine, NBP’s March projection pointed to a likely continuation of the relatively favourable economic situation in the coming quarters, despite somewhat slower economic growth.",
        "Certain Council members judged that the scale of the weakening of economic activity might be greater than indicated by the central path of the March projection.",
        "During the meeting it was pointed out that inflation in Poland – according to the Statistics Poland flash estimate – increased to 9.2% in January 2022.",
        "Council members emphasised that the markedly elevated inflation was mainly driven by a significant rise in the prices of energy and agricultural commodities as well as regulated tariffs for electrical energy, natural gas and heating.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that prices were also boosted by the ongoing economic recovery, including increased demand stimulated by rising household incomes.",
        "It was further observed that the markedly elevated price growth encompassed an increasingly broader group of goods and services, which was accompanied by a rise in core inflation.",
        "At the same time, it was noted that the reduction in some of the tax rates under the Anti-inflationary Shield had a curbing effect on inflation.",
        "With regard to the prospects of inflation in Poland, Council members pointed out that according to the NBP March projection, inflation in 2022 and the subsequent years would be higher than previously forecast.",
        "It was indicated that in 2022 inflation would be running at a substantially elevated level, which – in addition to the factors that had already boosted price growth – would result from the economic fallout of Russian military aggression against Ukraine.",
        "In particular, it was highlighted that the Russian aggression had contributed to a sharp rise in commodity prices, a weakening of the zloty and intensification of disruptions to supply chains.",
        "At the same time, according to the NBP March projection, despite being higher than previously expected, inflation will gradually subside in the coming years.",
        "This process will be facilitated by the fading of some of the global shocks currently driving up price growth, and the increases in the NBP interest rates.",
        "It was observed that declining inflation should also be supported by the appreciation of the zloty, since in the Council’s opinion, the market pressure on the weakening of the zloty – observed in the first days following the launch of the Russian military aggression against Ukraine – was not in line with the fundamentals of the Polish economy.",
        "At the same time, the Council members observed that the inflation outlook was subject to high uncertainty in the current environment.",
        "Developments in price processes would depend, in particular, on evolution of global commodity prices, which at the moment were highly volatile, the impact of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine on global and domestic economic conditions, as well as regulatory factors affecting prices.",
        "Council members assessed that in view of the additional shocks having an upward effect on price growth, and taking into account the expected relatively favourable economic situation in Poland, there persists a risk of inflation running above the NBP inflation target in the monetary policy transmission horizon.",
        "Consequently, Council members concluded that, in order to bring inflation down to the NBP inflation target in the medium term, the NBP interest rates should be raised again.",
        "The increase in the NBP interest rates will also curb inflation expectations and should support appreciation of the zloty.",
        "The Council decided to increase the NBP reference rate by 0.75 percentage points, i.e.",
        "to 3.50% and set the remaining NBP interest rates at the following levels: the lombard rate at 4.00%, the deposit rate at 3.00%, the rediscount rate at 3.55% and the discount rate at 3.60%.",
        "The Council members pointed out that the further decisions of the Council would depend on incoming information regarding perspectives for inflation and economic activity, including the impact of the Russian military aggression against Ukraine on the Polish economy.",
        "At the meeting it was pointed out that in 2022 Q2 labour market situation in the largest advanced economies remained very good, therefore the economic conditions in these economies were assessed to be relatively favourable.",
        "At the same time, it was stressed that in some of the emerging market economies, including China, the pace of economic activity growth had declined markedly, which had also had an adverse impact on export growth in the advanced economies.",
        "The Council members also drew attention to the fact that signs of a marked worsening of the global growth outlook had intensified recently, which was reflected in deteriorating sentiment of economic entities.",
        "It was pointed out that activity in the global economy and its outlook were under the negative impact of high prices of commodities and production components, persisting disruptions in the functioning of global supply chains and the repercussions of Russian military aggression against Ukraine, including high uncertainty.",
        "The tightening of monetary policy by the major central banks would also curb growth in economic activity.",
        "It was underlined that the available forecasts, both by external institutions and by NBP, indicated a significant deterioration of the global economic conditions.",
        "In particular, attention was drawn to the expected decline in annual GDP growth in the United States and – on a much larger scale – in the euro area.",
        "At the same time, it was emphasised that in the euro area there was a risk of a sharper than currently forecast slowdown in GDP growth, should the supply of gas from Russia be cut off entirely.",
        "Certain Council members also pointed out the risks for economic activity resulting from the next wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe.",
        "The Council members noted that in the recent months global inflation had continued to rise, reaching the highest levels in decades in many economies.",
        "During the discussion attention was drawn to the fact that – according to preliminary Eurostat data – in the euro area inflation stood at 8.6% in June, and it substantially varied across countries.",
        "It was pointed out that in many euro area countries annual price growth was in double digits, and in the Baltic countries it had reached approximately 20%.",
        "In turn, in the United States CPI inflation had risen to 8.6% in May.",
        "High commodity prices as well as the persisting disruptions in global supply chains and international transport, exacerbated by the effects of war, continued to be the main source of price growth around the world.",
        "The Council members drew attention to the fact that the situation in the commodity markets remained unfavourable, although recently it had become more diverse.",
        "In particular, the situation in the gas market had deteriorated amid the reports of reduced gas supply from Russia to more European countries, including Germany and Italy.",
        "It was stressed that the constrained supply of gas was boosting its price, which in the European market was approximately three times higher than a year ago and seven times higher than before the pandemic.",
        "On the other hand, the price of Brent oil had decreased in the recent period due to concerns about a global downturn, although it was still approximately 40% higher than a year ago and approximately 60% higher than before the pandemic.",
        "It was underlined that in some economies high growth in demand and rising labour costs, which translated into growth in core inflation, were also boosting prices.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that in many economies inflation forecasts for the coming quarters continued to be revised upwards, although it was highlighted that the expected global economic slowdown should curb inflation.",
        "During the discussion it was noted that in view of the high current and forecast inflation, many central banks had been tightening their monetary policy in the recent period.",
        "In June, the Federal Reserve of the United States once again raised its interest rates.",
        "In turn, the ECB concluded net asset purchases.",
        "Central banks in many economies, including in the Central-Eastern Europe region, continued to increase interest rates.",
        "While analysing the situation in the Polish economy, the Council members judged that the economic conditions in 2022 Q2 remained favourable, however, economic activity growth decelerated.",
        "Attention was drawn to the fact that although data on industrial output and retail sales in May indicated further relatively rapid growth in activity in annual terms, these figures were worse than expected by market analysts.",
        "It was also pointed out that total retail sales growth had been boosted by the high growth in sales of non-durable goods – supported by the demand generated by the refugees from Ukraine – while demand for durable goods had weakened.",
        "Meanwhile, incoming data indicated that conditions in the construction sector have deteriorated.",
        "The Council members also underlined that sentiment indicators, including the current consumer confidence indicator and the PMI index, had declined.",
        "The Council members drew attention to the fact that the unemployment rate in Poland remained at a historically low level.",
        "This was accompanied by a significant rise in wages, although annual wage growth in the enterprise sector slowed down in May to 13.5%.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that growth of average employment in this sector had halted in May in monthly terms which, along with the growing labour force participation of refugees from Ukraine, was probably limiting wage pressure.",
        "During the discussion on the economic activity outlook, attention was drawn to the fact that according to the projection, average annual GDP growth in 2022 would remain relatively high.",
        "However, it was underlined that this was mainly due to the strong growth in activity in 2022 Q1, while the second half of 2022 would most likely see a significant slowdown in GDP growth.",
        "At the same time, it was emphasised that according to the central path of the projection, in the second half of 2023 annual GDP growth would begin to gradually accelerate, although it would remain lower than in previous years.",
        "It was also pointed out that in line with the projection, the deteriorating economic conditions might lead to a slight rise in unemployment in the coming years, which would curb wage growth.",
        "Certain Council members pointed out that – in their opinion – despite the expected deterioration of the economic conditions, a rise in unemployment was unlikely.",
        "At the same time, it was underlined that both the domestic and global economic outlook were subject to significant uncertainty.",
        "At the meeting it was noted that according to the Statistics Poland flash estimate, inflation in Poland had increased in June 2022 to 15.6% y/y.",
        "At the same time, the Council members underlined that high inflation resulted mainly from an earlier strong rise in global energy and agricultural commodities prices – driven, to a large extent, by the repercussions of the Russian military aggression against Ukraine – and the earlier increases in regulated tariffs on electricity, natural gas and thermal energy.",
        "It was emphasised that consequences of disruptions in global supply chains and high shipping costs in international trade also boosted inflation.",
        "During the discussion it was also pointed out that price growth in Poland was supported by the continued robust demand, enabling enterprises to pass rising costs onto the final prices, which is accompanied by a rise in core inflation.",
        "However, attention was drawn to the fact that core inflation – apart from the influence of demand factors – reflected also the indirect impact of factors independent of the domestic economic conditions, which were boosting the production costs and prices of many goods.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that a curbing impact on inflation had been exerted by a reduction in some tax rates as part of the Anti inflationary Shield.",
        "During the discussion on the outlook for inflation in Poland, it was pointed out that according to NBP’s July projection, in the coming quarters inflation would remain high due to the continued impact of the factors currently boosting price growth, including those related to the Russian military aggression against Ukraine.",
        "Attention was also drawn to the risk of significant increases in regulated tariffs for electricity and natural gas at the beginning of 2023.",
        "The impact of unfavourable weather conditions and cost factors in agriculture, which exert upward pressure on food prices, was also highlighted.",
        "At the same time, it was underlined that the coming years would see a gradual decline in inflation towards the NBP target, which would be supported by the expected weakening of economic conditions, along with the fading of the impact of the shocks that were currently boosting prices as well as the NBP interest rate hikes implemented so far, which, among others, had been curbing credit growth.",
        "The decrease in inflation would also be supported by appreciation of zloty exchange rate, which, in the Council’s assessment, would be consistent with the fundamentals of the Polish economy.",
        "Certain Council members judged that the disinflation process might proceed slower than indicated in the projection, due to, among others, the possible fiscal policy easing.",
        "In the context of the projection, the Council members underlined that there were significant uncertainty factors regarding inflation outlook, such as the future course of the war in Ukraine, the developments in the global commodity markets, and also the scale of the global and domestic economic slowdown and its impact on price growth.",
        "Moreover, it was emphasised that the validity period of the lower tax rates under the Anti-Inflation Shield was also an uncertainty factor for the price growth in Poland.",
        "The Council members judged that there remained a risk of inflation running above the NBP inflation target in the monetary policy transmission horizon.",
        "Consequently, the Council concluded that, in order to bring inflation down to the NBP target in the medium term, NBP interest rates should be raised again.",
        "The increase in NBP interest rates is curbing inflation expectations and should support the appreciation of the zloty.",
        "The Council decided to increase the NBP reference rate by 0.50 percentage points, i.e.",
        "to 6.50% and set the remaining NBP interest rates at the following levels: the lombard rate at 7.00%, the deposit rate at 6.00%, the rediscount rate at 6.55%, and the discount rate at 6.60%.",
        "The Council members pointed out that further decisions of the Council would depend on incoming information regarding perspectives for inflation and economic activity, including the impact of the Russian military aggression against Ukraine on the Polish economy.",
        "At the Council meeting, it was observed that in 2022 Q1 conditions in the global economy remained relatively favourable, although prolonged disruptions in international trade, partially related to the successive waves of the pandemic in China, and high commodity prices had a negative impact on the global economic situation.",
        "The Council members highlighted that Russian military aggression against Ukraine had contributed to an intensification of these factors and to a substantial rise in uncertainty surrounding further global macroeconomic developments as well as led to a deterioration in economic sentiment.",
        "Consequently, activity growth slowed down in some economies in 2022 Q1 and GDP growth forecasts had been revised downwards.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that although in the United States GDP growth was lower in 2022 Q1 than in the previous quarter, further growth in domestic demand indicated that economic conditions remained good.",
        "It was observed that in the euro area GDP continued to grow in 2022 Q1, supported, among others, by a rebound in activity in the German economy following its decline in 2021 Q4.",
        "During the meeting it was pointed out that in the recent period inflation in many countries was still rising, reaching the highest levels in decades.",
        "At the same time, price growth forecasts for the coming quarters were significantly revised upwards.",
        "High commodity prices as well as prolonged disruptions in global supply chains and international transport remained the main source of rising inflation around the world.",
        "The impact of these factors on inflation processes in the recent period had intensified due to the Russian aggression against Ukraine.",
        "In particular, oil prices had risen once again, despite the decision of the United States to begin selling its oil supplies.",
        "At the same time, European prices of coal and gas were several times higher than a year ago.",
        "This was accompanied by a rapid growth in the prices of agricultural commodities, reflected in the agricultural commodity price index running at its highest level on record.",
        "The Council members observed that, apart from the factors indicated, in some of the economies rising labour costs were also contributing to the surge in inflation.",
        "At the Council meeting, it was stressed that, according to Eurostat preliminary data, in April 2022 HICP inflation in the euro area reached 7.5%.",
        "At the same time, in some economies of this currency area price growth was in double digits.",
        "Inflation remained high in the United States as well.",
        "At the same time, it was underlined that growth in core inflation that accounted for a significant part of consumer price inflation was observed both in the United States and in the euro area.",
        "The Council members pointed out that amidst a strong increase in inflation, many central banks were tightening their monetary policy, although the decisions of the major central banks were not uniform.",
        "The US Federal Reserve had concluded its net asset purchases and had raised interest rates for the second time in May.",
        "On the other hand, the ECB was keeping the deposit rate negative, although it had reduced the scale of its asset purchases.",
        "At the same time, the financial markets were expecting interest rate increases in the euro area later in the year.",
        "It was highlighted that recently central banks in Central-Eastern Europe region had continued to increase interest rates.",
        "When analysing the situation in the Polish economy, the Council members pointed out that, according to available data, the good economic conditions had continued in 2022 Q1.",
        "It was emphasised that, despite the Russian military aggression against Ukraine, which had contributed to a weakening in sentiment of economic entities, data for March had indicated a further significant rise in economic activity.",
        "In particular, retail sales had grown in real terms by 9.6%, which was partly supported by the inflow of refugees.",
        "In turn, industrial output had increased in March by 17.3% y/y.",
        "Construction and assembly output had also risen significantly.",
        "At the Council meeting it was pointed out that the situation of employees in the domestic labour market remained favourable.",
        "Steady employment growth in the enterprise sector continued, the number of job offers was increasing and unemployment was at a record low.",
        "It was pointed out that wage growth had picked up to 12.4% y/y in March.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that the high wage growth could be partly attributed to significant wage growth in mining and transport.",
        "It was also observed that although wages were currently growing rapidly, wage pressure had somewhat eased in the enterprise sector, while still remaining at high levels.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that the easing of this pressure, at least in some sectors, should be supported by the gradual professional activation of refugees.",
        "At the meeting the Council members assessed that a continuation of the favourable economic conditions might be expected in the coming quarters, although a gradual slowdown of economic growth was forecast.",
        "It was pointed out that in April consumer sentiment had slightly improved following a significant decline in March.",
        "It was assessed that the pace of economic growth would be negatively affected by the rise in the prices of commodities and some products, boosting corporate costs and limiting household disposable income.",
        "It was pointed out that the reduction in exports to Russia and Ukraine as well as the expected global economic slowdown might also contribute to the weakening of economic activity.",
        "At the same time, the domestic economic conditions would be supported by additional consumer demand due to the inflow of refugees as well as expenditure necessary to provide them with access to some services.",
        "It was pointed out that domestic demand and economic conditions would also be supported by fiscal policy measures, among others, the lowering of the personal income tax rate and the planned increase in expenditure on national defence.",
        "Council members also emphasised that currently both domestic and global economic outlook was subject to significant uncertainty stemming from the impact of Russian military aggression against Ukraine.",
        "It was pointed out that one of the factors of uncertainty was further development of commodity prices and the decisions about the import of energy carriers, including a potential embargo on Russian oil imports.",
        "In this context, the Council members pointed out that the direct deliveries of natural gas from Russia to Poland had been stopped.",
        "However, it was highlighted that given the available technical possibilities of obtaining gas from other sources and the relatively high level of stocks in gas storage facilities in Poland, according to the current forecasts it should not have a significant negative effect on domestic economic activity in the coming quarters.",
        "At the Council meeting it was observed that according to Statistics Poland flash estimate, inflation in Poland had increased to 12.3% y/y in April 2022, which was mainly driven by a strong growth in food prices, largely related to a rise in global agricultural commodities prices amid Russian military aggression against Ukraine.",
        "It was pointed out that food prices were probably also boosted by increased demand generated by the inflow of Ukrainian refugees to Poland.",
        "At the same time, it was emphasised that the earlier increases in energy commodities prices as well as in regulated tariffs on electricity, natural gas and thermal energy, continued to contribute to markedly elevated inflation.",
        "Inflation, especially with respect to the prices of goods, was also significantly boosted by disruptions in international trade – aggravated not only by the war in Ukraine, but also by the shutdown of factories and ports in China due to the pandemic – as well as high transport costs.",
        "Council members highlighted that the ongoing economic recovery, including an increase in demand driven by rising household incomes, had also had a positive contribution to the price growth.",
        "It was further noted that the markedly elevated price growth encompassed an ever broader group of goods and services, which was accompanied by a rise in core inflation.",
        "However, it was also highlighted that inflation was being mitigated by the reduction in tax rates under the Anti-Inflation Shield.",
        "Yet, at the same time, certain Council members pointed out that expected more expansionary fiscal policy would have pro-inflationary effects.",
        "With regard to the inflation outlook in Poland, the Council members stressed that in the coming quarters inflation would remain markedly elevated due to a further impact of the factors currently amplifying price growth, including those related the Russian military aggression against Ukraine.",
        "In the Council’s assessment, in the coming years inflation will gradually decline, although it will be higher than previously expected.",
        "The gradual decrease in price growth will result from the expected fading of some of the global shocks currently boosting prices, as well as from the increases in the NBP interest rates.",
        "The decrease in inflation should also be supported by appreciation of zloty exchange rate, which, in the Council’s assessment, will be consistent with the fundamentals of the Polish economy.",
        "At the same time, the Council members stressed that high uncertainty regarding future developments of inflation prevailed, as related, among others, to changes in commodity prices, impact of the Russian aggression against Ukraine on the global and domestic economic conditions, as well as regulatory factors affecting prices.",
        "The Council members assessed that in view of the above circumstances, including higher than expected price growth – which shifts the expected inflation path upwards in the coming quarters – and taking into account the expected relatively favourable economic situation in Poland, there remains a risk of inflation running above the NBP inflation target in the monetary policy transmission horizon.",
        "Consequently, the Council concluded that, in order to bring inflation down to the NBP inflation target in the medium term, the NBP interest rates should continue to be raised.",
        "The increase in NBP interest rates is curbing inflation expectations and should support the appreciation of the zloty.",
        "The Council decided to increase the NBP reference rate by 0.75 percentage points, i.e.",
        "to 5.25% and set the remaining NBP interest rates at the following levels: the lombard rate at 5.75%, the deposit rate at 4.75%, the rediscount rate at 5.30%, and the discount rate at 5.35%.",
        "The Council members pointed out that the further decisions of the Council would depend on incoming information regarding perspectives for inflation and economic activity, including the impact of the Russian military aggression against Ukraine on the Polish economy.",
        "At the meeting it was pointed out that the annual GDP growth had declined in 2022 Q2 in major economies, and the incoming Q3 data indicated a further deterioration in the global economic activity.",
        "This was because global economic activity and its outlook were still negatively affected by high prices of commodities and production components, the fallout from the Russia’s military aggression against Ukraine as well as, although to a lesser extent than before, global supply chain disruptions.",
        "Moreover, it was pointed out that global demand was and would be dampened by the tightening of monetary policy by many central banks, including the major ones.",
        "It was observed that GDP data for 2022 Q2 confirmed a decline in activity in this period in the United States and China, whereas in the euro area GDP had continued to grow.",
        "At the same time, it was indicated that economic activity in Europe in the coming quarters would be weighed down, above all, by a severe supply shock in the market for energy commodities and electricity.",
        "On the other hand, it was also observed that the labour market situation in the largest advanced economies remained very good, which was a factor stabilising economic conditions.",
        "However, it was pointed out that consumer confidence indicators were running at very low levels in these economies.",
        "With regard to inflationary developments, the Council members observed that in most economies inflation had continued to rise over recent months, reaching again the highest levels in decades in many countries.",
        "During the discussion, it was highlighted that inflation in the euro area, according to the Eurostat preliminary data, amounted to 9.1% in August, with many countries of the area recording a double-digit annual price growth, and the Baltic countries seeing inflation exceeding 20%.",
        "It was emphasised that although higher price growth continued to be mainly driven by high commodity prices and persistent – despite signs of their gradual easing – global supply chain disruptions, in some economies inflation was additionally fuelled by demand factors and rising labour costs.",
        "In effect, core inflation was also on the rise.",
        "The Council members drew attention to the results of business climate surveys, which suggested an easing of cost pressures as a result of mitigated supply chains disruptions and a decline in international transport costs.",
        "At the same time, continued rise in core inflation in many economies was evidence of an ongoing process of firms passing on sharp cost increases into the prices of finished goods.",
        "The Council members also noted that inflation forecasts for the coming quarters were being revised upwards in many economies, although it was pointed out that the expected slowdown in global economic growth would curb demand factors boosting prices.",
        "During the discussion it was observed, that, considering the high current and forecast inflation, many central banks had recently continued to tighten monetary policy.",
        "In particular, in July the Federal Reserve of the United States once again raised interest rates.",
        "In turn, in the same month the European Central Bank launched its first interest rate hike since 2011.",
        "While analysing the situation in the Polish economy, the Council members judged that the economic conditions in the first half of 2022 had remained favourable; yet the growth in economic activity had been slowing down, as evidenced by GDP data.",
        "It was pointed out that, in accordance with the Statistics Poland flash estimate, GDP grew by 5.5% y/y in 2022 Q2, and its decline compared to 2022 Q1, when the annual GDP growth reached 8.5%, was mainly due to significantly lower contribution of inventories.",
        "Meanwhile, annual consumption growth remained relatively high in 2022 Q2 and investment growth accelerated.",
        "When referring to monthly data, attention was drawn to the fact that data on industrial production, construction and assembly output, and retail sales in July as well as economic confidence indicators for August suggested that annual growth in economic activity in 2022 Q3 would decline further.",
        "In July, growth in both industrial production and construction and assembly output declined.",
        "Also retail sales in real terms slowed down, with sales of durable goods falling compared to the previous year.",
        "In August, in turn, consumer confidence indicators deteriorated and the PMI for industry saw another drop.",
        "Therefore, the Council members judged that in the coming quarters a further decline in the annual GDP growth should be expected, although the forecasts were currently subject to considerable uncertainty.",
        "It was pointed out that activity was negatively affected by, among others, the sharp increases in the prices of energy and energy carriers, although these effects would be mitigated by the extension of the Anti inflationary Shield and the introduction of carbon allowances and heating subsidies.",
        "During the discussion it was emphasised that the labour market situation remained very good, as reflected in the record low unemployment rate and the continued marked wage rises.",
        "It was pointed out that unemployment in July stayed at a historic low, while corporate employment continued to increase.",
        "It was indicated that wage growth in the corporate sector stood at 15.8% in July; however, its rise compared to the previous month level was largely the result of bonus payments in certain sectors.",
        "The Council members drew attention to the fact that for several months the number of job vacancies had been on a decline, which might follow from positions being filled with new employees, but might also indicate some fall in demand for labour.",
        "At the meeting, it was pointed out that according to the Statistics Poland flash estimate, inflation in Poland had risen to 16.1% y/y in August 2022.",
        "The Council members underlined that high inflation was still mainly the result of the earlier strong rise in global energy and agricultural commodity prices – driven, to a large extent, by the repercussions of the Russian military aggression against Ukraine – and the earlier increases in regulated domestic tariffs on electricity, natural gas and thermal energy.",
        "It was pointed out that inflation continued to be additionally boosted by the consequences of disruptions to global supply chains and passing by enterprises rising costs on to the final prices, which also translated into a rise in core inflation.",
        "Meanwhile, the reduction in some of the tax rates as part of the Anti-inflationary Shield was curbing inflation.",
        "While discussing the outlook for inflation in Poland, it was emphasised that according to available forecasts in the coming months inflation would remain close to the current level.",
        "The Council members underlined that the path of prices next year would be highly dependent on decisions regarding the Anti-inflationary Shield and the scale of increases in regulated prices.",
        "Some Council members judged that inflation would most likely remain highly elevated at least until mid-2023, although – due to the difficulty of predicting developments in regulatory and supply factors, including the further course of the war in Ukraine and the situation in the European commodities market, as well as the uncertainty about the scale of the expected slowdown in the global and European economy – the currently formulated forecasts remained subject to very high uncertainty.",
        "At the same time, the Council members pointed out that the significant increase in the NBP interest rates carried out over the past year, along with the fading impact of the shocks currently boosting prices and the slowdown in economic activity growth, would gradually dampen inflation in the coming years.",
        "The decrease in inflation would also be supported by the appreciation of the zloty exchange rate, which in the Council’s assessment, would be consistent with the fundamentals of the Polish economy.",
        "Alongside that, certain Council members judged that the disinflation process might be hampered by the possible fiscal policy easing.",
        "When referring to the effects of the monetary policy, some Council members drew attention to the fact that the strong increase in the NBP interest rates that had been introduced since October 2021, had translated into a significant rise in interests on loans and deposits, which was resulting, in particular, in a fall in lending to households and a shift in household funds from current accounts to term deposits or the purchase of Treasury bonds.",
        "At the same time, certain Council members emphasised that the introduction of the so-called repayment holidays for all mortgage borrowers was weakening the effect of the NBP’s monetary policy tightening.",
        "The Council members judged that there persisted a risk of inflation running above the NBP inflation target in the monetary policy transmission horizon.",
        "Consequently, the Council concluded that, in order to strive for bringing inflation down to the NBP target in the medium term, NBP interest rates should be raised again.",
        "The increase in the NBP interest rates will support curbing inflation expectations and the appreciation of the zloty.",
        "The Council decided to increase the NBP reference rate by 0.25 percentage points, i.e.",
        "to 6.75% and set the remaining NBP interest rates at the following levels: the lombard rate at 7.25%, the deposit rate at 6.25%, the rediscount rate at 6.80%, and the discount rate at 6.85%.",
        "The Council members pointed out that further decisions of the Council would depend on incoming information regarding the perspectives for inflation and economic activity, including the impact of the Russian military aggression against Ukraine on the Polish economy.",
        "During the discussion at the Council meeting, the situation in the external environment of the Polish economy was assessed.",
        "It was observed that growth in global economic activity was slowing down.",
        "It was pointed out that recent months had seen a marked deterioration in economic conditions in some emerging economies, including in China, while relatively favourable economic conditions persisted in the largest developed economies.",
        "The Council members highlighted that global economic activity continued to be curbed by high prices of commodities and components used in production, persisting global supply chain disruptions and the consequences of the Russian military aggression against Ukraine.",
        "It was pointed out that in 2022 Q1 the euro area had recorded moderate GDP growth, which resulted, on the one hand, from the gradual easing of the pandemic restrictions imposed in the euro area economy and, on the other hand, from the persisting supply chain disruptions, which had intensified in recent months due to the war in Ukraine and the zero-covid policy in China.",
        "At the same time, the situation in the euro area labour market continued to improve, with the unemployment rate declining to a very low level.",
        "The labour market situation remained favourable also in the United States, which translated into accelerating wage growth.",
        "It was pointed out that despite a decline in GDP in 2022 Q1, growth in private consumption and investment in the US economy was positive, and April had seen both retail sales and industrial output pick up.",
        "The Council members drew attention to a further rise in inflation worldwide, which in some countries reached the highest levels for decades.",
        "In particular, it was indicated that in May 2022 the euro area had seen HICP inflation rise to 8.1% (with some euro area economies recording double-digit inflation).",
        "In the United States inflation continued to run at a historically high level, although CPI inflation had declined slightly in April.",
        "It was emphasised that high commodity prices, prolonged disruptions in global supply chains and international transport, exacerbated by the effects of the war, remained the main source of rising inflation.",
        "In this context, some Council members drew attention to the European partial embargo imposed on Russian oil, which affected oil prices, and the decision of the OPEC countries to increase oil supply, which – in turn – should ease somewhat the tensions in the oil market.",
        "It was stressed that the price of oil had increased by more than 50% over the year, and by almost 200% over the past two years.",
        "European prices of coal and gas were also several times higher.",
        "Moreover, it was emphasised that the shock in energy commodity prices and the war in Ukraine had resulted in a sharp rise also in agricultural commodity prices.",
        "It was noted that in many economies a relatively high aggregate demand, financed partly with savings accumulated during the pandemic and partly with growing income, amidst a very good labour market situation, supported the transmission of supply shocks to inflation.",
        "It was emphasised that as a result, core inflation was also on the rise.",
        "At the same time, inflation forecasts for the coming quarters were significantly revised upwards.",
        "At the meeting it was pointed out that amid a strong rise in inflation, many central banks were tightening their monetary policy.",
        "In particular, the US Federal Reserve had ended its net asset purchases and was continuing its interest rate hikes.",
        "On the other hand, the ECB had so far kept negative interest rates, yet had reduced the scale of its asset purchases.",
        "Central banks in many economies, including in Central and Eastern Europe, had continued to increase interest rates.",
        "While analysing the situation in the Polish economy, the Council members pointed out that according to the Statistics Poland preliminary estimate, in 2022 Q1 GDP growth amounted to 8.5% y/y.",
        "However, the data on its structure indicated that the rise in inventories had a large contribution to GDP growth, whereas consumption and investment growth had declined.",
        "It was assessed that the large growth in inventories was likely the result of companies accumulating raw materials and semi-products due to the uncertainty about their future prices and serious disruptions in supply chains.",
        "The Council members emphasised that data available for 2022 Q2 suggested continuation of favourable economic conditions, although the pace of economic activity was gradually declining.",
        "Attention was drawn, in particular, to the fact that in April growth in industrial output had slowed down somewhat, and that in May the PMI index for industry had fallen below the level of 50 points.",
        "Data for construction were also markedly worse, with a significant slowdown in the growth of construction and assembly production.",
        "At the same time, April saw a significant growth in retail sales which was, on the one hand, the result of the inflow of refugees and the pandemic-related base effects and, on the other hand, the result of the constantly rising household income.",
        "It was emphasised that the situation in the domestic labour market continued to be very good, which was confirmed by the LFS data for 2022 Q1 and the incoming monthly data.",
        "In April employment continued to rise, accompanied by a further fall in unemployment and a marked rise in wages.",
        "The Council members assessed that the outlook for the Polish economy in the coming quarters was still relatively favourable, although a slowdown in economic growth was anticipated.",
        "At the same time, it was noted that forecasts of the macroeconomic situation both in Poland and worldwide are fraught with high uncertainty.",
        "It was pointed out that the pace of economic growth would still be negatively affected by growing prices of commodities and certain products, resulting in a rise in enterprises’ costs and limiting the growth in real disposable income of households.",
        "Economic activity would also be curbed by the forecast slowdown in global economic growth.",
        "It was emphasised that a more in depth analysis of the medium-term scenario for the Polish economy would be possible in July, after the projection of inflation and GDP is published.",
        "It was pointed out at the meeting that in May 2022 inflation in Poland had risen to 13.9% y/y.",
        "It was emphasised that heightened inflation in Poland – as in other countries – was mainly driven by a sharp rise in global prices of energy and agricultural commodities which was largely the result of the Russian military aggression against Ukraine.",
        "Other global factors affecting consumer prices were supply chain disruptions and high costs of international transport.",
        "Another factor boosting inflation in Poland was the earlier increases in regulated domestic tariffs on electricity, natural gas and thermal energy.",
        "Consequently – as pointed out by the Council members – in May the annual growth of energy prices reached 33% and that of food prices exceeded 13%.",
        "At the same time, price growth was supported by high demand, which facilitates enterprises to pass growing costs to prices of final products, resulting also in higher core inflation.",
        "On the other hand, inflation was mitigated by the reduction in some tax rates under the Anti-Inflation Shield.",
        "With regard to the outlook for inflation in Poland, the Council members stressed that in the coming quarters inflation would remain markedly elevated due to the further impact of the factors currently boosting price growth, including those related to the Russian military aggression against Ukraine.",
        "It was emphasised that high uncertainty regarding future inflation prevailed, among others, due to uncertainty concerning changes in commodity prices, the impact of war in Ukraine on the global and domestic economic conditions, as well as due to regulatory changes affecting prices, including the decision on solutions provided for in the Anti-Inflation Shield.",
        "At the same time, the Council members pointed out that the NBP interest rates increases, together with fading of the impact of shocks currently boosting prices would contribute to a gradual fall in inflation in the coming years.",
        "The decrease in inflation should also be supported by appreciation of zloty exchange rate, which, in the Council’s assessment, would be consistent with the fundamentals of the Polish economy.",
        "However, certain Council members pointed out that expected more expansionary fiscal policy would have pro-inflationary effects.",
        "Certain Council members also pointed out that the government measures aimed at shielding mortgage borrowers, i.a.",
        "by introduction of the so-called repayment holidays, would hinder the efforts to permanently lower inflation.",
        "At the same time, they indicated that the planned changes in reference rates could, depending on the adopted solutions, weaken the monetary transmission mechanism.",
        "In context of the discussion on macroeconomic conditions, the Council members assessed that there remained a risk of inflation running above the NBP inflation target in the monetary policy transmission horizon.",
        "Consequently, the Council concluded that, in order to bring inflation down to the NBP inflation target in the medium term, the NBP interest rates should continue to be raised.",
        "The increase in NBP interest rates is curbing inflation expectations and should support the appreciation of the zloty.",
        "The Council decided to increase the NBP reference rate by 0.75 percentage points, i.e.",
        "to 6.00% and set the remaining NBP interest rates at the following levels: the lombard rate at 6.50%, the deposit rate at 5.50%, the rediscount rate at 6.05%, and the discount rate at 6.10%.",
        "The Council members pointed out that further decisions of the Council would depend on incoming information regarding perspectives for inflation and economic activity, including the impact of the Russian military aggression against Ukraine on the Polish economy.",
        "At the Council meeting, it was observed that the activity in global economy continued to recover, yet the economic conditions were under a negative impact of supply-side constraints in some markets, high commodity prices and re-escalation of the pandemic in certain countries.",
        "It was pointed out that the rise in infections adversely affected activity in the service sector of the euro area, including Germany.",
        "However, economic conditions in the euro area manufacturing sector remained relatively favourable.",
        "When referring to the global economic outlook, it was stated that current forecasts pointed to further relatively fast global GDP growth in 2022, although slower than in 2021.",
        "At the same time, it was observed that the pandemic situation, in particular the impact of the spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant, remained a factor of uncertainty for global economic growth.",
        "It was emphasized, however, that according to current assessments, its impact on economic activity might be limited.",
        "It was indicated that the prices of energy commodities and some agricultural commodities were markedly higher than a year before.",
        "It was noted that in December 2021 large fluctuations in natural gas prices occurred in Europe, mainly related to Russia’s policy on the supply of this commodity, while at the end of December natural gas prices were 5 times higher than a year before.",
        "It was emphasized that the very high prices of CO2 emissions allowances related to the tightening of the EU climate policy had been an additional factor increasing the prices of energy carriers in Europe.",
        "At the same time, disruptions in global supply chains persisted, and prices of international transport remained elevated.",
        "In the opinion of the Council, the above factors, along with the strong demand recovery, were contributing to the marked increase in global inflation.",
        "In particular, it was noted that in November HICP inflation in the euro area reached 4.9%, the highest level in the history of this currency area, and in the United States CPI inflation in November stood at 6.8%, the highest level in about 40 years.",
        "Inflation forecasts for the coming quarters had been also revised upwards, which, in the Council’s opinion, indicated the risk that the impact of the pandemic shock on inflationary processes would be more persistent than previously assessed.",
        "The Council members pointed out that given the considerable growth in both current and expected inflation, many central banks were withdrawing monetary accommodation, although the monetary authorities’ decisions were not homogenous and reflected the country-specific conditions for the conduct of monetary policy.",
        "It was observed that central banks in Central and Eastern Europe were raising their interest rates.",
        "The US Federal Reserve has increased the pace of reduction in monthly asset purchases and market expectations indicate that the first interest rate rise in this economy could occur already in the first half of 2022.",
        "At the same time, the ECB is keeping negative interest rates, although it announced a reduction in the scale of its net asset purchases in 2022.",
        "When analysing the situation in the Polish economy, Council members emphasized that the recovery continued despite the autumn wave of increase in infections.",
        "This was indicated by the monthly data for November 2021, according to which industrial output rose by 15.2% y/y, and this increase comprised almost all the branches, including the automotive industry.",
        "Attention was also drawn to the marked rise in construction and assembly production as well as retail sales.",
        "It was emphasized that high demand in the labour market persisted, which was reflected in declining unemployment and rising employment levels.",
        "It was also noted that this was accompanied by a substantial increase in job offers, which might point to firms increasingly struggling to fill vacancies due to the labour shortages.",
        "Under these circumstances the wage growth in the corporate sector continues to be relatively high.",
        "The majority of the Council members judged that a further increase in labour demand might translate more into higher wages rather than higher employment.",
        "At the same time, the majority of Council members pointed to the risk of a potential intensification of wage pressure due to the elevated inflation.",
        "Referring to the economic outlook, it was assessed that the economic situation would remain favourable in the coming quarters.",
        "However, it was pointed out that the impact of the pandemic on the global and domestic economy as well as the impact of supply constraints and the high prices of energy commodities, which constituted negative supply shocks for the economy, were factors of uncertainty for the pace of activity growth.",
        "During the meeting, it was observed that inflation in Poland had risen to 7.8% in year-on year terms in November 2021, and stood at 1.0% in monthly terms.",
        "In the Council’s assessment, inflation growth had been mostly driven by external factors, including the surge in the global prices of energy and agricultural commodities in the second half of 2021, the record-high increase in the prices of CO2 emissions allowances, rising prices of goods, whose supply was constrained by the global pandemic disruptions, as well as the earlier increases in electricity prices and in waste disposal charges.",
        "It was judged that the ongoing economic recovery, including the growth in demand stimulated by rising household income, also contributes to the upward pressure on inflation.",
        "In this context, rising core inflation indices were highlighted, along with the increasing share of products and services, whose prices were rising at an accelerated pace.",
        "It was judged that this could contribute to higher inflation expectations.",
        "While analysing the outlook for inflation, the Council members emphasised that according to forecasts, price growth in 2022 would remain considerably elevated.",
        "Along with the continued impact of the higher energy and agricultural commodity prices and CO2 emissions allowances, as well as the prices of goods whose supply is constrained by the global pandemic disruptions, a substantial rise in regulated tariffs on energy carriers, including electricity and natural gas for households, will contribute to inflation remaining elevated in 2022.",
        "It was also stressed that amid the favourable economic conditions, the rising prices of energy and the remaining costs would be gradually passed on to the prices of other goods and services in the CPI basket.",
        "In the opinion of the majority of the Council members the main factors contributing to higher inflation in 2022 constituted negative supply shocks.",
        "However, certain Council members emphasised the increasing significance of domestic factors.",
        "At the same time, it was observed that a reduction in some tax rates as part of the so-called Anti-inflationary Shield would have a curbing impact on inflation.",
        "The significance of the exchange rate channel in the monetary transmission mechanism was also highlighted.",
        "It was noted that inflation would decrease in a longer perspective, supported by the expected fading of some global shocks currently boosting price growth, and by the hitherto NBP interest rate increase.",
        "However, the majority of the Council members were of the opinion that amidst further recovery in domestic economic activity and expected continuation of the favourable labour market conditions, as well as probably more lasting impact of the external shocks on price growth, a risk of inflation running above the NBP inflation target in the monetary policy transmission horizon persisted.",
        "The majority of the Council members assessed that in order to bring inflation down to the NBP target in the medium term the NBP interest rates should be raised again.",
        "In the opinion of the Council members, the NBP interest rate rise would also curb inflation expectations.",
        "Certain Council members expressed the opinion that another interest rate hike generated the risk of a negative impact of this factor on economic conditions, as it would translate into a further increase in the debt-servicing costs of bank loans for household and enterprises.",
        "The Council decided to raise the NBP reference rate by 0.50 percentage points, i.e.",
        "to 2.25% and to set the remaining NBP rates at the following levels: the lombard rate at 2.75%, the deposit rate at 1.75%, the rediscount rate at 2.30% and the discount rate at 2.35%.",
        "The Council rejected the motion to raise the basic required reserve ratio from 2.0% to 3.5% and the motion to change the remuneration of the required reserves, from the level of the NBP reference rate to the level of the NBP deposit rate.",
        "The Council members pointed out that the Council’s decisions in the coming months would continue to be aimed at reducing inflation to a level consistent with the NBP inflation target in the medium term, while taking into account economic conditions, so as to ensure medium-term price stability and at the same time support sustainable economic growth after the pandemic shock.",
        "The Council’s assessment regarding the total scale of monetary tightening necessary for achieving these goals would consider incoming information on perspectives for inflation and economic growth, including the situation in the labour market.",
        "Certain Council members expressed an opinion that ongoing significant uncertainty remained an important factor to be accounted for in monetary policy decisions.",
        "At the Council meeting, it was observed that after a strong growth in global economic activity in 2021, economic conditions in some countries deteriorated somewhat, mainly due to re-escalation of the pandemic at the turn of the year.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that the pandemic situation should stabilise over the coming months as evidenced by the experience of the countries first hit by the Omicron variant of the coronavirus.",
        "It was assessed that this would translate into a renewed acceleration in global GDP growth, supported by further recovery in consumption.",
        "However, the Council members noted that – apart from the re-escalation of the pandemic – economic activity was still negatively affected by supply-side constraints in some markets and high commodity prices, while future course of the pandemic, geopolitical tensions related to the Russia’s aggression against Ukraine and developments in economic policy of the major countries remained important uncertainty factors.",
        "It was emphasised that, according to the latest forecasts, global GDP growth in 2022 would be lower than in 2021, yet it would remain relatively robust.",
        "It was highlighted that energy commodity prices as well as prices of some agricultural commodities remained markedly higher than a year ago, which contributed to a rise in inflation worldwide.",
        "Persisting disruptions in global supply chains and still elevated international shipping costs act in the same direction.",
        "In the European Union, climate policy is an important factor additionally increasing prices.",
        "The Council members noted that inflation in many countries stood at its highest level in decades: in the euro area HICP inflation rose to 5.1% in January 2022 and in the United States CPI inflation reached 7.0% in December 2021.",
        "Moreover, also core inflation measures have been rising globally, supported by favourable economic situation and improvement in labour market conditions.",
        "In effect, inflation forecasts have been revised upwards and indicate that in many economies inflation in 2022 will remain above central banks’ targets.",
        "The Council members observed that against the above background, i.e.",
        "favourable economic conditions and elevated inflation, many central banks were withdrawing monetary accommodation.",
        "In particular, it was indicated that central banks in the Central Eastern Europe had been raising interest rates.",
        "The ECB keeps negative interest rates, although it has been reducing the scale of asset purchases.",
        "The US Federal Reserve signals a termination of asset purchases in March and a readiness to start increasing interest rates.",
        "It was noted that at least four interest rate increases in the United States in 2022 was a likely scenario.",
        "The Council members pointed out that this was a factor which, together with continued geopolitical tensions, had been weakening the exchange rates of emerging market countries, including the zloty.",
        "Certain Council members indicated, however, that some central banks – both in advanced and emerging market countries – approached monetary policy tightening with caution.",
        "When analysing the situation in the Polish economy, the Council members emphasised that according to Statistics Poland preliminary estimate, GDP growth in 2021 amounted to 5.7%, which was an evidence of a significant acceleration in annual GDP growth in 2021 Q4, despite the autumn wave of increase in Covid cases.",
        "The monthly data on industrial output, retail sales and construction and assembly output for December 2021 also indicate that economic conditions remain very good.",
        "It was observed that situation in the labour market continued to improve as well, which was reflected in a fall in unemployment rate (seasonally adjusted), a rise in employment and a marked increase in average wages in corporate sector in December.",
        "Some Council members noted that although the acceleration in the growth of wages could result from a shift in their variable components, wage growth had been high for a long time and firms were planning significant wage increases also in 2022.",
        "At the same time, the majority of the Council members highlighted the risk of a likely rise in wage pressure due to elevated inflation.",
        "In this context, certain Council members pointed to the surveys’ results indicating a considerable surge in the percentage of firms declaring an increase in wage pressure.",
        "Other Council members emphasised that the percentage of enterprises with wage growth exceeding labour productivity growth was still lower than before the pandemic.",
        "Referring to the economic outlook, it was assessed that the economic situation would remain favourable in the coming quarters.",
        "However, the impact of the pandemic on global and domestic economy was indicated as an uncertainty factor, together with supply-side constraints and high energy commodity prices, which constituted negative supply shocks to the economy.",
        "Moreover, certain Council members observed some deterioration in consumer sentiment and business confidence indicators over the recent past.",
        "According to these Council members, GDP growth will slow down, yet rather gradually.",
        "Certain Council members emphasised a relatively high growth of loans in the economy.",
        "In the opinion of these Council members, the tightening of monetary policy would reduce growth in indebtedness, which seems warranted, especially with regard to households’ loans.",
        "At the meeting, it was noted that inflation in Poland had risen to 8.6% in December 2021.",
        "It was stressed that the increase in inflation in 2021 had been mainly driven by external factors that were beyond the impact of domestic monetary policy.",
        "These factors included the rise in global commodity prices, the record-high increase in the prices of CO2 emission allowances, rising prices of goods, whose supply was constrained by the global pandemic related disruptions, as well as the increases in electricity and natural gas prices introduced in 2021, which largely reflected the situation in global commodity markets and the climate policy of the European Union.",
        "The Council members indicated that ongoing economic recovery had also added to the increase in inflation, as seen in rising core inflation measures.",
        "Some Council members noted that favourable economic conditions facilitated the passing through of higher costs, evidenced by rising producer prices and wages, to consumer prices.",
        "In this context, a very high PPI growth abroad was pointed to, which – due to trade links – contributed to the strong PPI growth also in Poland.",
        "It was assessed that these factors, together with a rise in regulated tariffs on electricity, natural gas and thermal energy, would act towards inflation remaining at an elevated level also in 2022, and – taking into account available forecasts – in 2023.",
        "In the opinion of the majority of the Council members, the main factors contributing to higher inflation constituted negative supply shocks.",
        "Yet certain Council members emphasised the role of domestic factors, as evidenced – in their judgement – i.a.",
        "by high growth in services prices.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that a reduction in some tax rates as part of the so called Anti-inflationary Shield would have a curbing effect on inflation, although it would be difficult to define its horizon at present.",
        "Certain Council members, however, indicated that the launching of the Shield, accompanied by other fiscal measures, entailed a relative easing of fiscal policy, and thus meant that monetary policy needs to bear bigger burden of tightening macroeconomic policy.",
        "The significance of the exchange rate channel in the monetary transmission mechanism was also highlighted.",
        "It was noted that the expected fading of some global shocks currently boosting price growth and the increase in the NBP interest rates would support the decrease in inflation in a longer-term perspective.",
        "However, the majority of the Council members were of the opinion that amidst further domestic economic recovery and expected continuation of favourable labour market conditions, as well as probably more lasting impact of external shocks on price dynamics, a risk of inflation running above the NBP inflation target in the monetary policy transmission horizon persisted.",
        "The majority of the Council members assessed that in order to bring inflation down to the NBP target in the medium term the NBP interest rates should be raised again.",
        "In the opinion of the Council members, the NBP interest rate rise would also curb inflation expectations.",
        "At the same time, it was emphasised that zloty appreciation would be consistent with the direction of monetary policy conducted by NBP.",
        "Yet certain Council members expressed the opinion that another interest rate hike generated the risk of a negative impact of this factor on economic conditions, as it would translate into a further increase in the debt-servicing costs of bank loans for households and enterprises.",
        "The Council decided to raise the NBP reference rate by 0.50 percentage points, i.e.",
        "to 2.75% and to set the remaining NBP interest rates at the following levels: the lombard rate at 3.25%, the deposit rate at 2.25%, the rediscount rate at 2.80% and the discount rate at 2.85%.",
        "At the same time, the Council decided to increase the required reserve ratio from 2.0% to 3.5%.",
        "The Council members pointed out that the Council’s decisions in the coming months would continue to be aimed at reducing inflation to a level consistent with the NBP inflation target in the medium term, while taking into account economic conditions, so as to ensure medium-term price stability and, at the same time, support sustainable economic growth after the global pandemic shock.",
        "The Council’s assessment regarding the total scale of monetary tightening necessary for achieving these goals would consider incoming information on perspectives for inflation and economic growth, including situation in the labour market.",
        "Certain Council members expressed an opinion that ongoing significant uncertainty remained an important factor to be accounted for in monetary policy decisions.",
        "At the meeting, it was pointed out that economic conditions in the external environment of the Polish economy continued to weaken.",
        "In 2022 Q3, annual GDP growth in the euro area declined considerably, whereas it stabilised in the United States.",
        "It was underlined that the coming quarters were expected to see a slowdown in activity in these economies, despite still very favourable labour market conditions there, as evidenced by data on historically low unemployment and a rapid rise in nominal wages.",
        "Yet, the majority of the Council members assessed that with time the deteriorating economic situation in the euro area and the United States would be reflected in higher unemployment, which was also anticipated by the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve of the United States.",
        "It was assessed that the consequences of Russia’s military aggression against Ukraine, including the high prices of commodities, food and production components, as well as monetary policy tightening, continued to negatively affect global economic activity and its prospects.",
        "Moreover, it was pointed out that considerable uncertainty about the further impact of those shocks on economic conditions remained, especially in the European economy, despite a certain decline in gas prices observed in Europe in the recent period.",
        "Referring to the recently released data, the Council members highlighted that inflation was still on the rise in many countries, and that this continued to be driven by high commodity prices and persisting, though easing, global supply chain disruptions.",
        "Moreover, it was indicated that demand factors and growing labour costs were likewise boosting prices in many economies, which – along with the pass-through of the earlier rises in production costs to consumer prices – were also pushing up core inflation.",
        "It was pointed out that in October 2022 the HICP in the euro area had increased above 10%, exceeding market expectations, and in Germany the HICP reached 11.6%.",
        "It was observed that in September inflation was on the rise in the majority of Central and Eastern European countries as well.",
        "At the same time, in the United States – despite a decline in CPI inflation in October – core inflation continued to rise.",
        "The Council members emphasised that high inflation remained a global problem, yet, considerable monetary policy tightening by major central banks together with the fading of the earlier shocks boosting price growth, including a certain decline in prices of some commodities and the easing of global supply chain disruptions, would gradually curb global inflationary pressure.",
        "The Council members pointed out that amid persistently high inflation the central banks of the largest economies continued to tighten monetary policy.",
        "The majority of the Council members emphasised that many of them, including the Federal Reserve of the United States and in particular the European Central Bank, had started raising interest rates much later than, for example, the central banks of Central and Eastern Europe.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that monetary policy tightening by the major central banks would be complementary to the decisions taken by the central banks of smaller economies that had already tightened monetary policy significantly.",
        "While analysing the situation in the Polish economy, the Council members judged that the available monthly data pointed to a decline in annual GDP growth in 2022 Q3.",
        "The average growth in real retail sales dropped sharply compared to 2022 Q2, which suggested weakening consumer demand.",
        "In this context, attention was drawn to the fact that in October 2022 both the current and the leading consumer confidence indices of Statistics Poland were running at a low level.",
        "Furthermore, it was pointed out that the average growth in construction and assembly output in 2022 Q3 declined considerably, whereas the situation in the manufacturing sector remained relatively good; yet, also in this sector average output growth was lower than in 2022 Q2, despite the easing of global supply chain disruptions.",
        "Moreover, some Council members indicated that the manufacturing PMI had been on the decline for several months, pointing to a slowdown in this sector, with capacity utilisation in manufacturing in October having dropped to the lowest level in several quarters.",
        "At the same time, certain Council members emphasised that construction of buildings, as part of construction and assembly output, was at a level markedly higher than the long-term trend, data on construction and assembly output and on retail sales suggested that those indicators were at the level of a long-term average, and that the growth of industrial output was above a long-term average, whereas certain business indicators inferred from survey studies did not always adequately anticipate future changes in economic situation.",
        "While discussing the outlook for economic activity in Poland, some Council members pointed out that in line with the central path of the NBP November projection, GDP growth in 2023 should amount to 0.7% and domestic demand should decline.",
        "They indicated that GDP growth would also be relatively low in 2024 and the output gap would be negative from 2022 Q4 until the end of the projection horizon.",
        "The Council members emphasised that the situation in the domestic labour market continued to be very good, which was reflected, in particular, in the very low unemployment rate.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that real wage growth in the enterprise sector remained negative in September, and that in line with the projection, wages in real terms were likely to decline further in the coming quarters.",
        "Moreover, some Council members indicated that business surveys signalled a deterioration in the labour market conditions which – in the opinion of those Council members – would weaken employees’ wage bargaining power.",
        "It was pointed out at the meeting that according to the Statistics Poland flash estimate, in October 2022 CPI in Poland increased to 17.9%.",
        "Alongside that, it was also stated that domestic inflation was still affected by strong exogenous shocks, including, in particular, global energy and agricultural commodity prices and persisting, though easing, global supply chain disruptions.",
        "Attention was paid to the fact that these shocks did not only directly affect prices in Poland, including mainly energy and food prices, but – by boosting corporate costs amid relatively high demand – were passed through to prices of other goods and services.",
        "As a consequence, core inflation was also on the rise.",
        "Referring to the risk of inflation persisting at an elevated level, certain Council members pointed to rising consumer inflation expectations and higher inflation forecasts by analysts in October 2022.",
        "They also indicated a significant role of domestic demand factors and a limited scale of mitigating inflationary pressure by the hitherto conducted monetary policy.",
        "When discussing the outlook for inflation in Poland, it was indicated that in line with the NBP November projection, the annual CPI would remain high in the nearest future and in 2023 Q1 it might even exceed its current level, which would be driven by the effects of the earlier growth in commodity prices and the announced termination of some reduced tax rates implemented under the so-called Anti-inflationary Shield.",
        "Yet, according to the available forecasts, as from 2023 Q2 inflation should start to gradually decline to the NBP inflation target (2.5% +/- 1 percentage point) which, in the opinion of the majority of the Council members, should be supported in particular by the strong monetary policy tightening implemented so far by NBP, the effects of which will fully materialise in the coming years due to lags in the monetary policy transmission mechanism.",
        "In line with the central path of the November projection – under the assumption of unchanged interest rates – inflation would return to the NBP inflation target in 2025.",
        "Yet, certain Council members assessed that inflation might start to decline later than foreseen in the NBP November projection and that – even assuming the CPI would run in line with this projection – in 2023 and 2024 inflation would run significantly above the level embodied in the July projection.",
        "Referring to fiscal policy in the context of its impact on the economy in 2023, the majority of the Council members pointed out that in line with the NBP estimates, in 2023 the general government structural deficit should be close to the 2022 level.",
        "Certain Council members judged that unfavourable conditions for financing the borrowing needs of the state budget should act towards reducing the deficit in 2023.",
        "During the discussion it was argued that the hitherto strong monetary policy tightening by NBP had a significant impact on the situation in the credit market and the structure of private sector financial assets, which should curb domestic demand pressure.",
        "In this context, some Council members pointed out that in 2022 Q3 the stock of consumer loans had declined and lending in the housing loans segment had slowed down significantly.",
        "Certain Council members also indicated that the strong growth in corporate loans observed in the recent months concerned mainly the largest enterprises and might result from a deterioration in their liquidity position.",
        "Other Council members emphasised that the annual growth in PLN housing loans remained positive and that most firms finance investment using their own funds, which should be kept in mind while analysing lending to this sector.",
        "Referring to changes in the structure of financial assets of the private sector, it was pointed out that the outflow of funds from current deposits to term deposits and to the Treasury bonds market continued in the recent period.",
        "In the opinion of the majority of the Council members, these changes evidenced strong monetary policy tightening in Poland.",
        "The majority of the Council members assessed that the expected weakening of the external economic conditions, together with monetary policy tightening by major central banks, would curb global inflation and commodity prices.",
        "The weakening of the global economic conditions would also hamper GDP growth in Poland.",
        "Under such circumstances, the hitherto significant monetary policy tightening by NBP would support a decline in inflation in Poland towards the NBP inflation target.",
        "At the same time, given strength and persistence of the current shocks that remain beyond the impact of domestic monetary policy, in the short term inflation would remain high, and its return to the NBP inflation target would be gradual.",
        "Alongside that, it was underlined that in accordance with the Monetary Policy Guidelines for 2022, the Council flexibly determined the desirable time necessary to bring the inflation back to the target, as bringing inflation rapidly back to the target might entail significant costs to macroeconomic stability.",
        "A decrease in inflation would be faster if supported by appreciation of zloty exchange rate, which, in the Council’s assessment, would be consistent with the fundamentals of the Polish economy.",
        "In the opinion of these Council members, considering the scenario of the gradual return of inflation to the NBP inflation target in the coming years as assumed in the November projection, amid the concurrent anticipated deterioration in domestic economic conditions, including in the labour market, it was justified to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged.",
        "However, certain Council members expressed the opinion that given the still favourable – in their view – economic conditions in Poland, including in the labour market, the persistently high price growth and elevated inflation expectations as well as the too sluggish disinflation process in light of the forecasts, the hitherto scale of interest rate hikes was – in their opinion – insufficient to ensure the return of inflation to the target in the medium term and to lower inflation expectations to levels consistent with the medium-term inflation target.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 6.75%, the lombard rate at 7.25%, the deposit rate at 6.25%, the rediscount rate at 6.80%, and the discount rate at 6.85%.",
        "The Council members pointed out that further decisions of the Council would depend on incoming information regarding the perspectives for inflation and economic activity, including the impact of the Russian military aggression against Ukraine on the Polish economy.",
        "At the Council meeting, it was observed that the global economic recovery continued at the beginning of 2022, particularly in the United States and in the euro area, although the activity growth slowed down in some economies.",
        "Global economic conditions were adversely affected by the prolonged disruptions in international trade and high commodity prices.",
        "Council members emphasised that Russian military aggression against Ukraine had contributed to a substantial rise in uncertainty surrounding further global macroeconomic developments.",
        "It was noted that this was accompanied by a significant deterioration in sentiment in some economies, and heightened volatility in international financial and commodity markets.",
        "At the same time, prices of many commodities continued to increase, and disruptions in international trade have intensified.",
        "It was emphasised that forecasts accounting for the impact of the Russian aggression on global economic conditions indicated that activity in the coming quarters would be weaker than previously expected.",
        "During the meeting it was pointed out that at the beginning of 2022 many economies had seen the highest price growth in decades.",
        "High commodity prices as well as prolonged disruptions in global supply chains and international transport have remained the main source of global inflation growth.",
        "In some economies, rising prices were also driven by growing labour costs, hence core inflation was also increasing.",
        "At the same time, it was emphasised that Russian military aggression against Ukraine was contributing to further global inflation growth, mainly due to the related rise in global commodity prices and intensification of disruptions in international trade.",
        "In particular, Council members pointed out that oil and natural gas prices were substantially higher than before the Russian aggression.",
        "Agricultural commodity prices had also sharply increased– especially wheat – and the global index of agricultural commodity prices had reached the highest level on record.",
        "It was noted that the impact of the Russian aggression on Ukraine on prices had already been partially reflected in the March readings of inflation, which had risen substantially in many countries.",
        "In particular, it was stressed that HICP inflation in the euro area – according to preliminary data – had risen to 7.5% in March.",
        "It was also observed that in some of the euro area economies, including Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and the Netherlands, price growth in March 2022 was in double digits.",
        "At the same time, available forecasts suggest that the upward influence of Russia’s aggression on global inflation would be sustained in the subsequent quarters, which would translate into higher than previously anticipated price growth in Poland’s external environment.",
        "The Council members pointed out that amidst a strong increase in global inflation, many central banks were withdrawing monetary accommodation.",
        "In particular, it was stressed that in March the US Federal Reserve had concluded net asset purchases and had increased interest rates for the first time in over 3 years.",
        "It was also indicated that the ECB kept negative interest rates, although in March it had reduced the planned scale of asset purchases, while signalling the possibility of the programme’s termination in 2022 Q3.",
        "It was noted that banks in Central and Eastern Europe continued to raise interest rates.",
        "When analysing the situation in the Polish economy, Council members pointed out that, according to available data, in 2022 Q1 economic activity remained high, following the strong GDP growth in 2021 Q4.",
        "In particular, it was indicated that the robust growth in industrial output had continued in February 2022.",
        "It was also observed that retail sales growth remained high, driven, among others, by increased purchases of essential goods and fuels in reaction to the Russian aggression against Ukraine.",
        "At the same time, high frequency data point to a further, increased spending on these products in March, when their consumption was additionally boosted by purchases for refugees arriving from Ukraine.",
        "The Council members assessed that the inflow of refugees from Ukraine would also affect the domestic labour market.",
        "It was observed that the current situation is favourable for employees: employment continued to rise, wage growth was still robust, and almost half of the enterprises reported vacancies.",
        "It was assessed that, although in the short run the outflow of Ukrainians, returning to their homeland to join the fight, might generate temporary bottlenecks in some industries (particularly construction and transport), in the longer run migration should have a positive impact on labour supply in Poland.",
        "In reference to the economic activity outlook, the Council members assessed that Russian military aggression against Ukraine would weaken economic growth in Poland, although the scale of this effect was highly uncertain.",
        "Among the factors adding to the uncertainty was the persistence of consumer and business confidence deterioration observed after the onset of Russian aggression and its impact on real macroeconomic processes.",
        "It was assessed that the pace of economic growth would be negatively affected by the rise in the prices of commodities and some products, boosting corporate costs and limiting household disposable income.",
        "It was pointed out that the reduction in exports to Russia and Ukraine might also contribute to the weakening of economic activity.",
        "However, the share of exports to these economies in Polish foreign trade is relatively small, which should limit the negative impact of the reduced sales to these markets on economic activity in Poland.",
        "It was also emphasised that at the same time there would be factors supporting the domestic economic conditions, including, additional consumer demand generated by the refugees as well as potential spending necessary to provide them with access to basic services.",
        "A the meeting, it was pointed out that economic activity growth would also be supported by fiscal policy measures, among others, the lowering of the personal income tax rate and the planned increase in expenditure on national defence.",
        "At the meeting, it was pointed out that according to Statistics Poland flash estimate, inflation in Poland had risen significantly in March and was running at 10.9% y/y.",
        "The Council members emphasised that the increase in inflation in March had been mainly driven by the consequences of Russian military aggression against Ukraine, which was reflected in record high fuel price growth – which reached 28% in monthly terms – and robust growth in the prices of other energy carriers.",
        "It was pointed out that this was accompanied by an increase in consumer inflation expectations.",
        "At the same time, attention was drawn to the fact that the earlier rise in the prices of energy and agricultural commodities as well as regulated tariffs for electricity, natural gas and heating, continued to contribute to significantly elevated inflation.",
        "Council members also observed that prices were also boosted by the ongoing economic recovery, including increased demand stimulated by rising household income.",
        "It was further noted that the markedly elevated price growth encompassed an ever broader group of goods and services, which was accompanied by a rise in core inflation.",
        "However, it was also pointed out that inflation was being mitigated by the reduction in tax rates under the Anti-Inflation Shield.",
        "With regard to the inflation outlook in Poland, Council members stressed that inflation would remain markedly elevated in 2022, which – apart from factors that had been previously amplifying inflation – was due to the economic consequences of Russian military aggression against Ukraine.",
        "At the same time, according to the Council’s assessment, inflation will gradually decline in the coming years, although it will be higher than previously expected.",
        "The gradual decrease in price growth will result from the fading of some of the global shocks currently boosting prices, as well as from the increases in the NBP interest rates.",
        "The decrease in inflation should also be supported by appreciation of zloty exchange rate, which, in the Council’s assessment will be consistent with the fundamentals of the Polish economy.",
        "At the same time, the Council members stressed that in the current circumstances there was heightened uncertainty regarding future developments of inflation, which was related, among others, to changes in commodity prices, the impact of Russian aggression against Ukraine on the global and domestic economic conditions, as well as regulatory factors affecting prices.",
        "Council members assessed that in view of the above circumstances, including higher than expected price growth – which shifts the expected inflation path upwards in the coming quarters – and taking into account the expected relatively favourable economic situation in Poland, there remains a risk of inflation running above the NBP inflation target in the monetary policy transmission horizon.",
        "Consequently, the Council concluded that, in order to bring inflation down to the NBP inflation target in the medium term, the NBP interest rates should continue to be raised.",
        "The increase in NBP interest rates is curbing inflation expectations and should support the appreciation of the zloty.",
        "The Council decided to increase the NBP reference rate by 1.00 percentage points, i.e.",
        "to 4.50% and set the remaining NBP interest rates at the following levels: the lombard rate at 5.00%, the deposit rate at 4.00%, the rediscount rate at 4.55%, and the discount rate at 4.60%.",
        "The Council members pointed out that the further decisions of the Council would depend on incoming information regarding perspectives for inflation and economic activity, including the impact of the Russian military aggression against Ukraine on the Polish economy.",
        "At the meeting it was pointed out that incoming data indicated a deterioration of global economic conditions in 2022 Q3.",
        "Activity in the global economy and its prospects were under the negative impact mainly of high prices of commodities and production components, as well as the repercussions of Russia’s military aggression against Ukraine and the tightening of monetary policy around the world.",
        "Alongside that, it was pointed out that in many countries the situation in the labour market remained favourable.",
        "The majority of the Council members underlined, however, that real purchasing power of wages continued to be curbed by high inflation, which was accompanied by pessimistic consumer and business sentiment.",
        "It was pointed out that in Europe high energy prices and concerns about gas shortages in the face of the coming winter were weakening economic activity, and in energy-intensive sectors had already led to falls in production.",
        "At the same time, sharply rising prices of necessity goods were limiting the possibility of many households to purchase other goods and services.",
        "This was accompanied by continued high uncertainty about the European economic activity outlook.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that in the United States the outlook for economic activity was better than in the euro area – due to, among others, the fact that the US economy was not dependent on energy commodities from Russia – although it was also negatively affected by high inflation and significant monetary tightening.",
        "It was pointed out, that the weakening of global economic conditions and weaker prospects for global economic growth were accompanied, during the discussed period, by deteriorating sentiment and increased volatility in global financial markets.",
        "This was reflected in a marked drop in equity and bond prices, as well as a depreciation of many currencies against the US dollar.",
        "With regard to global inflationary developments, certain Council members noted that in many economies inflation was running at the highest level in decades.",
        "It was emphasised that – according to Eurostat preliminary data – inflation in the euro area rose to around 10% in September, reaching almost 11% in Germany, over 17% in the Netherlands, and continued to clearly exceed 20% in the Baltic states.",
        "It was underlined that high commodity prices, driven partly by the consequences of Russia's military aggression against Ukraine, continued to be a significant source of high price growth in many economies.",
        "Price growth was also boosted by global supply chain disruptions, which were still present despite their gradual easing.",
        "In this context, attention was drawn to the very strong growth in producer prices in many economies, including in Germany.",
        "The Council members also underlined that in some economies rising prices were also driven by demand factors and rising labour costs.",
        "Certain Council members judged that the impact of demand factors on price growth was currently significant.",
        "It was emphasised that increased demand, along with the pass-through of earlier increases in production costs to consumer goods prices, were also boosting core inflation.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that there were signals that the scale of the external shocks which had boosted inflation around the world was gradually decreasing, which – besides the gradual easing of global supply chain disruptions – was evidenced by a slight fall in oil prices.",
        "In this context, it was pointed out that CPI inflation in the United States had decreased slightly in the recent period, although it was accompanied by further growth in CPI core inflation.",
        "At the meeting it was observed that amid high inflation, the major central banks had recently continued to tighten their monetary policy.",
        "In September the Federal Reserve of the United States and the European Central Bank had significantly increased interest rates once again.",
        "At the same time, certain Council members emphasised that the monetary policy tightening by the major central banks was accompanied by communication indicating their determination to bring inflation down to the target.",
        "It was pointed out that monetary policy tightening by the major central banks should reduce inflationary pressure on a global scale and contribute to a weakening of the global economic conditions.",
        "It was judged that the measures taken by the major central banks would therefore be complementary to the monetary tightening implemented in many economies.",
        "Against this background – and also taking into account the lag in the monetary policy transmission mechanism – certain central banks, that had earlier raised interest rates significantly (e.g.",
        "the Czech National Bank), were currently refraining from further interest rate hikes.",
        "However, certain Council members pointed out that further interest rate increases by the major central banks would – ceteris paribus – reduce their interest rate disparity with other economies, which might contribute to an appreciation of the base currencies.",
        "These Council members judged that, in such a situation, the impact of the weakening of global inflationary pressure on price growth in many countries would be limited.",
        "While analysing the situation in the Polish economy, the majority of the Council members judged that the available monthly data suggested a gradual deterioration in the economic conditions.",
        "Attention was drawn to the weakening household sentiment and lower sales of durable goods than a year earlier, and it was observed that the accompanying further growth in retail sales in annual terms was partly the result of demand generated by Ukrainian refugees.",
        "It was underlined that indicators of economic conditions in the manufacturing sector were also pessimistic.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that industrial production continued to grow significantly, supported by the easing of global supply chain disruptions.",
        "Certain Council members judged, however, that the deterioration in the economic conditions was not marked.",
        "The Council members drew attention to the fact that in the coming quarters, amid a global economic slowdown, a further decline in GDP growth in Poland was forecast, which – despite the government’s shielding measures – would be driven by high prices of energy and its carriers.",
        "At the same time, it was underlined that the economic outlook was subject to significant uncertainty.",
        "During the discussion it was pointed out that despite the deteriorating economic conditions, the situation in the labour market remained very good, which was reflected in the low unemployment rate.",
        "However, the majority of the Council members judged that data from the enterprise sector might suggest a slight cooling down of labour demand in some sectors.",
        "They expressed the opinion that – along with the increased supply of labour from Ukrainian refugees – it should help curb wage pressure and over time contribute to reducing inflation.",
        "At the same time, other Council members underlined that annual growth in average wages in the enterprise sector had remained lower than consumer price growth for several months and therefore the purchasing power of wages in this sector was falling.",
        "However, a judgement was expressed that the labour market situation would hamper the reduction of inflation, due to the marked increase in unit labour costs.",
        "At the meeting it was pointed out that according to the Statistics Poland flash estimate, inflation in Poland had risen to 17.2% y/y in September 2022.",
        "Certain Council members drew attention to the acceleration in price growth, including in monthly terms.",
        "The majority of the Council members underlined that high inflation was still mainly the result of the earlier strong rise in global energy and agricultural commodity prices – driven, to a large extent, by the repercussions of the Russian military aggression against Ukraine – and the earlier increases in regulated domestic tariffs on electricity, natural gas and thermal energy.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that inflation was also boosted by enterprises passing rising costs onto the final goods prices and the consequences of the earlier global supply chain disruptions, which also drove up core inflation.",
        "Certain Council members underlined that price growth was also driven by demand factors.",
        "The Council members also pointed out that the reduction in some of the tax rates as part of the Anti-inflationary Shield was curbing annual inflation index.",
        "While discussing the outlook for inflation in Poland, it was emphasised that according to available forecasts inflation would remain close to the current level in the coming months, and should decline over the next year.",
        "It was underlined that the price path would be highly dependent on the decision regarding the Anti-inflationary Shield and the development of regulated prices, including an electricity price freeze up to a certain level of consumption.",
        "Meanwhile, it was pointed out that the currently formulated forecasts were still subject to very high uncertainty, including uncertainty about the further course and repercussions of the Russia’s military aggression against Ukraine, the situation in the European commodities markets, and also the scale of the expected global economic slowdown.",
        "Certain Council members judged that despite the decline in inflation next year – partly as a result of base effects – price growth, in case of no further monetary tightening, would remain above the inflation target in the medium term.",
        "These Council members judged that the disinflation process would be hampered by the heightened inflation expectations of households and enterprises.",
        "In this context, they pointed out that the level of real interest rates – taking into account the level of inflation expected next year by these economic agents as well as by professional forecasters – remained negative.",
        "Meanwhile, it was pointed out that hitherto significant NBP interest rate hikes had contributed to a marked rise in interest rates on loans and deposits, which should curb domestic demand pressure and, consequently, gradually limit the possibility of passing rising costs onto the final goods prices.",
        "In particular, it was underlined that NBP's monetary policy tightening had curbed lending in the housing loans segment and had contributed to negative annual growth in the total value of consumer loans.",
        "This was also accompanied by a change in the structure of household assets, including a shift in some funds from current deposits to term deposits and the purchase of government bonds.",
        "By contrast, certain Council members emphasised that the introduction of so called repayment holidays for all mortgage borrowers was weakening the effect of NBP’s monetary policy tightening.",
        "The majority of the Council members judged that the hitherto significant monetary policy tightening by NBP and the expected slowdown in economic activity growth, which in part stemmed from external shocks, would contribute to curbing demand growth in the Polish economy, which would support a decline in inflation in Poland towards the NBP inflation target.",
        "The majority of the Council members pointed out that, given strength and persistence of the current shocks that remained beyond the impact of domestic monetary policy, a return of inflation towards the NBP inflation target would be gradual.",
        "Alongside that, it was underlined that in accordance with the Monetary Policy Guidelines for 2022, the Council flexibly determined the desirable time necessary to bring the inflation back to the target, as bringing inflation rapidly back to the target might entail significant costs to macroeconomic stability.",
        "The decrease in inflation would also be supported by the appreciation of the zloty exchange rate, which in the Council’s assessment, would be consistent with the fundamentals of the Polish economy.",
        "However, certain Council members expressed the opinion that in view of the still favourable economic conditions in Poland, the high price growth and the heightened inflation expectations, as well as due to the easing of fiscal policy, the hitherto scale of interest rate hikes was, in their view, insufficient to ensure the return of inflation to the target in the medium term.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 6.75%, the lombard rate at 7.25%, the deposit rate at 6.25%, the rediscount rate at 6.80%, and the discount rate at 6.85%.",
        "The Council members pointed out that further decisions of the Council would depend on incoming information regarding the perspectives for inflation and economic activity, including the impact of the Russian military aggression against Ukraine on the Polish economy.",
        "At the meeting, it was noted that growth of economic activity in the major economies was slowing down.",
        "Incoming information signalled, in particular, a further slowdown in economic activity in the euro area, including a possible fall in GDP in quarterly terms in 2022 Q4.",
        "On the other hand, GDP was expected to continue to grow in the United States.",
        "It was pointed out that although the situation in the labour markets of the largest economies remained favourable, economic activity and its prospects were still negatively affected by the consequences of Russia’s military aggression against Ukraine, including the still high commodity prices, as well as the global monetary policy tightening.",
        "This was accompanied by deteriorating business conditions in China, to a large extent due to the pandemic situation and the pandemic restrictions imposed there.",
        "Moreover, some Council members observed that the available forecasts for 2023 suggested a marked decline in GDP growth in the largest developed economies compared to 2022.",
        "It was underlined that this also applied to Germany, Poland’s largest trading partner, where – like in the euro area as a whole – a recession could not be ruled out in 2023.",
        "At the same time, it was emphasised that uncertainty persisted about the prospects for global economic growth.",
        "The Council members indicated that in many economies inflation remained at the highest level for decades.",
        "Attention was drawn to the fact that core inflation remained high in most countries as well.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that in the United States CPI inflation had been slowing down for several months, while in the euro area the HICP index had declined in November for the first time in many quarters.",
        "This was supported by a fall in the prices of some commodities, including gas prices in Europe, and oil and agricultural commodities in global markets, as well as the gradual easing of the supply chain disruptions and a decline in freight prices.",
        "Under such conditions, in many countries – among others in the United States and the euro area, including Germany – the annual growth of producer prices had also begun to decrease, while in China it had fallen to negative values.",
        "The Council members were of the opinion that these factors would slow down growth in consumer prices around the world, although the secondary effects of the earlier shocks would continue to have an impact on inflation, and particularly on core inflation.",
        "It was pointed out that many central banks were continuing to tighten monetary policy, although – as some Council members argued – further interest rate hikes by the major central banks would most likely be smaller in scale than the previously implemented increases, as was indicated also by market expectations.",
        "As a result, in the period preceding the meeting of the Council, long-term bond yields in the United States and the largest euro area countries had declined.",
        "At the same time, it was noted that following previous large hikes in interest rates, most central banks in Central and Eastern European countries had recently kept interest rates unchanged.",
        "On the other hand, certain Council members underlined that the Federal Reserve of the United States was indicating the possibility of raising interest rates to a level higher than expected in previous months, while with regard to the ECB, a reduction in the Eurosystem balance sheet in 2023 could be expected, which would additionally tighten monetary conditions in the euro area.",
        "Moreover – in the opinion of these Council members – in the case of many economies a reduction in interest rates should not be expected in the coming years.",
        "While analysing the situation in the Polish economy, the Council members pointed out that in 2022 Q3 annual GDP growth had slowed down to 3.6% (compared to 5.8% in 2022 Q2).",
        "It was stressed that household consumption growth had fallen to 0.9%, while fixed capital formation growth had fallen to 2.0%, and that investment growth of large and medium-sized enterprises had declined, which was evidence of a sharp slowdown in domestic demand growth.",
        "On the other hand, the contribution of net exports and changes in inventories to GDP growth had increased.",
        "It was observed that monthly data for October and business confidence indicators for November signalled a further slowdown in economic activity in 2022 Q4, and in particular, that real retail sales growth and industrial production growth had been lower than on average in 2022 Q3.",
        "It was pointed out that the weakening of economic conditions was related, among others, to the slowdown in global economic growth, but was also a result of the fall in real household income, especially since it was accompanied by weak economic agents’ sentiments, and took place following strong monetary policy tightening.",
        "At the same time, it was noted that growth in construction and assembly output in October 2022 had been close to the average for 2022 Q3, although some Council members judged that the sharp fall in newly granted housing loans would lead to a significant decline in housing construction in the coming period.",
        "On the other hand, certain Council members expressed the view that an analysis of selected “soft” economic indicators suggested that the recession phase was ending and that the economy was entering the recovery phase.",
        "The Council members judged that the situation in the labour market remained good.",
        "At the same time, some Council members drew attention to the fact that the fall in total employment in annual terms observed in the LFS data for 2022 Q3, the results of the PMI surveys indicating plans to reduce employment, and the growing concerns of households about the rise in unemployment suggest a deteriorating labour market outlook.",
        "When referring to data for 2022 Q3, certain Council members pointed out that the public sector had a larger negative contribution to the annual fall in total LFS employment than the private sector.",
        "It was also underlined that despite the increase in nominal wages, real wage growth was negative.",
        "At the meeting it was pointed out that according to the Statistics Poland flash estimate, CPI inflation in Poland had declined to 17.4% y/y in November 2022.",
        "It was noted that the slowdown in inflation had stemmed from the fall in fuel prices due to the decline in global oil prices and the appreciation of the zloty.",
        "It was judged that the probable fall in heating fuel prices, in particularly of coal, may also have been conducive to curbing inflation.",
        "At the same time, it was underlined that consumer price growth remained high, which was largely due to the impact of sharp external shocks, related predominantly to global commodity prices, which – amid still relatively high demand – had prompted companies to pass higher costs onto the prices of consumer goods.",
        "Combined with the persisting effects of global supply chain disruptions – despite their ongoing easing – this was also boosting core inflation.",
        "However, some Council members pointed out that the strength of these factors might be beginning to weaken, which was signalled by the gradual decline in the PPI index.",
        "Moreover, these Council members drew attention to a decline in consumer inflation expectations in November 2022 and a downward revision of financial analysts’ forecasts of inflation in 2024.",
        "In turn, certain Council members underlined that consumer inflation expectations remained very high.",
        "When discussing the outlook for inflation in Poland, it was indicated that inflation was likely to pick up at the beginning of 2023 due to the anticipated increase in energy prices, the planned withdrawal of some reduced tax rates under the so-called Anti-Inflation Shield and the base effects.",
        "Yet, according to the available forecasts, including the November NBP projection, as from 2023 Q2 inflation should start to gradually decline to the NBP inflation target (2.5% +/-1 percentage point).",
        "In the opinion of the majority of the Council members, the disinflation process would be supported by the strong monetary policy tightening implemented so far by NBP, the effects of which would fully materialise in the coming quarters due to lags in the monetary policy transmission mechanism.",
        "The disinflation process would also partly be the effect of the monetary policy tightening by major central banks – weakening global economic conditions – coupled with the expected fading impact of the supply shocks occurring in recent quarters and the easing of global supply chains’ disruptions.",
        "It was emphasised that the decline in global agricultural commodity prices in recent months should soon translate into slower food price growth in Poland.",
        "During the discussion the majority of the Council members argued that the strong monetary policy tightening hitherto implemented by NBP had a significant impact on the situation in the credit market.",
        "It was pointed out, in this context, that lending to households had slowed down significantly, and the stock of consumer and zloty housing loans had markedly declined since the beginning of the year.",
        "A decline in the M3 aggregate, in real terms, was also brought to attention, which – in the opinion of the majority of the Council members – was a sign of a strong monetary policy tightening in Poland, which would contribute to lower inflation, albeit with a lag.",
        "Furthermore, it was emphasised that even taking into account the so-called loan repayment holidays, the impact of higher debt service costs on household disposable income would be greater in 2023 than in 2022, which meant a further tightening in monetary conditions despite the NBP interest rates being kept unchanged.",
        "In contrast, other Council members pointed out that the interest rate on housing and consumer loans to households had risen by less than the NBP reference rate.",
        "The majority of Council members underlined that given the assessments based on the November projection, the structural deficit of the general government sector in 2023 would remain close to its 2022 level, which suggested a neutral fiscal policy stance.",
        "Other Council members observed that the scale of fiscal measures aimed at alleviating the rise in food and energy prices charged to households in Poland – in relation to GDP – was significant in 2022 and could also be expected to be large in 2023.",
        "The majority of the Council members assessed that the expected weakening of the external economic conditions, together with monetary policy tightening by major central banks, would curb global inflation and commodity prices.",
        "The weakening of the global economic conditions would also hamper GDP growth in Poland.",
        "Under such circumstances, the hitherto significant monetary policy tightening by NBP would support a decline in inflation in Poland towards the NBP inflation target.",
        "At the same time, given the strength and persistence of the current shocks that remain beyond the impact of domestic monetary policy, in the short term inflation would remain high, and its return to the NBP inflation target would be gradual.",
        "Alongside that, it was underlined that the Council flexibly determined the desirable time necessary to bring inflation back to the target, as bringing inflation rapidly back to the target might entail significant costs to macroeconomic stability.",
        "The decrease in inflation would be faster if supported by appreciation of zloty exchange rate, which, in the Council’s assessment, would be consistent with the fundamentals of the Polish economy.",
        "In the opinion of these Council members, considering the expected scenario of the gradual return of inflation to the NBP inflation target in the coming years, amid the deterioration in domestic economic conditions, including in the labour market, and the incoming signals of the global inflationary pressure slowing down, it was justified to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged.",
        "However, certain Council members expressed the opinion that given the still favourable – in their view – economic conditions in Poland, including in the labour market, the persistently high price growth and elevated inflation expectations, the hitherto scale of interest rate hikes was – in their opinion – insufficient to ensure the return of inflation to the target in the medium term and to lower inflation expectations to levels consistent with the medium-term inflation target.",
        "In the opinion of those Council members, the disinflation process as foreseen by the forecasts, and particularly the decline in core inflation, would be too slow.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 6.75%, the lombard rate at 7.25%, the deposit rate at 6.25%, the rediscount rate at 6.80%, and the discount rate at 6.85%.",
        "The Council members pointed out that further decisions of the Council would depend on incoming information regarding the perspectives for inflation and economic activity, including the impact of the Russian military aggression against Ukraine on the Polish economy."

    "2024": [
        "During the discussion at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council it was noted that in 2024 Q1 GDP had grown in the euro area in annual terms, following a fall in the second half of 2023.",
        "However, it was underlined that despite a slight recovery, activity in this economy was still weakened, with a better economic situation in those euro area countries with whom Poland has less economic ties.",
        "In Germany – Poland’s main trading partner – annual GDP growth remained negative in 2024 Q1, although signs of recovery had also appeared there.",
        "Meanwhile, in the United States annual GDP growth was still relatively high in 2024 Q1, despite being somewhat lower than market expectations.",
        "When discussing inflation developments abroad, the Council members noted that in April 2024 HICP inflation in the euro area stood at 2.4% (like in March), amid a further fall in core inflation.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that in the United States price growth in the recent period had been higher than expected, and in March CPI inflation had stood at 3.5% (compared to 3.2% in February 2024), amid a stabilisation of core inflation.",
        "Due to diverging disinflation processes in the two largest developed economies, it was noted that expectations of financial market participants indicated the possibility of an interest rate cut by the European Central Bank at the next meeting and interest rates kept unchanged by the Federal Reserve of the United States in the coming months.",
        "When discussing economic activity in Poland, the Council members judged that the incoming data indicated a gradual economic recovery, although certain monthly data from March 2024 were below expectations.",
        "It was pointed out that the annual GDP growth in 2024 Q1 had most probably been higher than in the previous quarter.",
        "Attention was drawn to the fact that data on retail sales in 2024 Q1 suggested a gradual growth in household demand, while data on industrial and on construction and assembly output might signal a decline in investment growth.",
        "When referring to the labour market conditions, it was noted that annual nominal wage growth in the enterprise sector had remained high in March 2024.",
        "The Council members underlined that amid inflation running at the level consistent with the NBP inflation target, in recent months real wage growth in the enterprise sector had been running at its highest level in many years.",
        "It was stressed that business surveys indicated slower wage growth in 2024 Q2.",
        "The Council members also pointed to a further slight fall in employment in the enterprise sector.",
        "During the discussion it was noted that annual growth in zloty-denominated loans to households continued to increase and that growth in corporate investment loans had picked up, although annual growth in current corporate loans had remained negative.",
        "At the meeting it was pointed out that – according to the Statistics Poland flash estimate – in April 2024 annual consumer price growth amounted to 2.4% (compared to 2.0% in March 2024), i.e.",
        "it had remained at a level consistent with the NBP inflation target.",
        "The Council members underlined that the increase in annual growth compared to the previous month was mainly the result of an increase in food prices caused by the restoration of the VAT rate from zero to 5% and by an increase in fuel prices.",
        "At the same time, the Council members indicated that in April 2024 inflation net of food and energy prices had probably declined again, although it was still higher than the headline CPI inflation.",
        "It was noted that especially growth in services prices remained elevated, particularly due to strong wage growth amidst the relatively high share of wages in the costs of this sector.",
        "Certain Council members drew attention to the fact that in March 2024 annual price growth of a significant proportion of goods and services included in the CPI basket still exceeded 3.5%.",
        "The Council members pointed out that recently the sharp fall in industrial producer prices in annual terms had continued, confirming the fading of most of external supply shocks and limited cost pressure.",
        "Together with the relatively low – despite some acceleration – economic activity growth this had been conducive to limiting inflation.",
        "It was judged that inflation was also curbed by the appreciation of the zloty exchange rate, which was consistent with the fundamentals of the Polish economy.",
        "Some Council members indicated that the current level of interest rates was a factor that should limit inflationary pressure also in the medium term.",
        "These Council members underlined that inflation expectations were running at low levels.",
        "When discussing the inflation outlook, Council members pointed out that according to the available forecasts, in 2024 Q2 CPI inflation would remain at a level consistent with the NBP inflation target of 2.5% ± 1 p.p., although it would most likely continue to rise in the coming months, due to higher food and energy price growth.",
        "At the same time, the Council members noted that developments in energy prices in the subsequent quarters were still subject to high uncertainty.",
        "Should subsidies to energy prices be fully or partially removed, inflation would rise significantly in the second half of 2024, exceeding the NBP inflation target.",
        "In turn, should energy prices be kept unchanged, inflation in the second half of 2024 would rise much weaker, running close to the upper limit of deviations from the inflation target.",
        "When referring to the medium-term outlook, it was pointed out that the growth in food prices driven by the increase in the VAT rate, and the expected increase in energy prices in the second half of 2024, might also influence inflation expectations.",
        "However, it was indicated that although higher food and energy prices might raise wage demands and upward pressure on social benefits, at the same time they would reduce growth in household disposable income, contributing towards lower demand pressure.",
        "The Council members noted that the further development of wage growth was the main risk factor for the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "It was pointed out that the transmission of higher wages to prices might depend on many factors, including the speed of the recovery in domestic economic activity, changes in corporate profitability, and households’ propensity to save.",
        "The Council members noted that fiscal policy remained a risk factor for the inflation outlook.",
        "It was stressed that so far some of the declared fiscal measures had still not been implemented, such as the increase in the amount of social benefits or the introduction of new ones.",
        "The persistence of other significant sources of uncertainty was also underlined, including, among others, the tense geopolitical situation, commodity price developments and the economic conditions in the environment of the Polish economy.",
        "The majority of Council members assessed that despite the observed economic recovery, demand and cost pressures in the Polish economy remained low, which, amidst weakened economic conditions and falling inflation pressure abroad, supported lower domestic inflation.",
        "As a result, it is expected that in 2024 Q2 annual CPI growth will run at the level consistent with the NBP inflation target.",
        "This will be accompanied by lower than in the previous quarters inflation net of food and energy prices, although – due to elevated growth in services prices – it will stay above the CPI inflation.",
        "In subsequent quarters, inflation developments are, however, associated with substantial uncertainty related i.a.",
        "to the impact of fiscal and regulatory policies on price developments, including on inflationary expectations, as well as the pace of economic recovery in Poland and labour market conditions.",
        "It was emphasised that should energy prices be raised, inflation might rise significantly in the second half of 2024.",
        "Alongside that, over the medium term demand pressure in the economy will be stimulated by significant wage growth, stemming, among others, from wage increases in the public sector.",
        "Against this background, the Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged.",
        "The Council judged that the current level of the NBP interest rates was conducive to meeting the NBP inflation target in the medium term.",
        "A view was expressed that given the elevated core inflation, as well as the expected further recovery in demand and high wage growth, the current level of NBP interest rates was too low to ensure the sustainable return of inflation to the target in the medium term.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 5.75%, the lombard rate at 6.25%, the deposit rate at 5.25%, the rediscount rate at 5.80%, and the discount rate at 5.85%.",
        "The Council members pointed out that further decisions of the Council would depend on incoming information regarding prospects for inflation and economic activity.",
        "During the discussion at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council it was noted that the global economic conditions were gradually improving, but continued to vary across economies and sectors.",
        "A gradual improvement was also observed in Poland’s main trading partners.",
        "According to forecasts, Germany should see some recovery in activity in 2024 Q2, yet it was underlined that it would probably be slow.",
        "Meanwhile, economic conditions in the United States remained better than in the euro area.",
        "While discussing inflation developments abroad, the Council members pointed out that price growth in the euro area and the United States was slightly above the inflation targets.",
        "At the same time, core inflation remains higher than headline inflation.",
        "It was highlighted that according to preliminary Eurostat data, in May 2024 core inflation in the euro area rose somewhat for the first time in almost a year.",
        "It was pointed out that the elevated service price growth in the major economies continued to act as a key factor hampering disinflation.",
        "This was related, on the one hand, to higher demand growth for services than goods, and on the other, to cost factors associated with continued elevated nominal wage growth.",
        "The Council members drew attention to the fact that the expectations of financial market participants indicated a high probability of an interest rate cut by the European Central Bank in June 2024.",
        "In the United States, in turn, interest rates are more likely to remain stable in the coming months according to market expectations.",
        "While discussing economic activity in Poland, the Council members assessed that the recovery was continuing, although the most recent data were mixed.",
        "GDP growth had accelerated to 2.0% in 2024 Q1.",
        "It was observed that amid rising real wages, annual consumption growth had picked up markedly (reaching 4.6%, the highest in almost two years).",
        "It was pointed out that the recovery in demand might gradually translate into price pressures.",
        "At the same time, it was stressed that consumption growth was slower than real wage growth, suggesting a build-up of savings.",
        "In contrast, annual investment growth had declined significantly.",
        "Certain Council members emphasised the impact of developments in the real net household assets on consumption.",
        "When discussing monthly data, it was pointed out that industrial output grew by almost 8% in April, which was the largest increase in around one and a half year – although this was in part due to statistical factors.",
        "On the other hand, retail sales growth in April was weaker than market forecasts.",
        "At the same time, the PMI index for May decreased, adding to the uncertainty about the pace of further recovery in manufacturing.",
        "With regard to the labour market conditions, it was noted that nominal wages in the national economy grew by more than 14% y/y in 2024 Q1, supported by wage rises in the public sector and increase in the minimum wage.",
        "Certain Council members emphasised that wage growth in 2024 Q1 was higher than indicated by the March projection.",
        "On the other hand, the annual wage growth in the enterprise sector declined again in April and – following sharp rises in the first three months of the year – the average wage was somewhat lower than in March.",
        "It was indicated that amid the slightly higher inflation, in April real wage growth had also slowed down somewhat, while remaining close to the historically high level.",
        "It was pointed out that employment in enterprises had fallen slightly again in April, although the number of job offers had increased compared to March.",
        "At the same time, the number of the working persons according to the LFS declined in 2024 Q1.",
        "When discussing wage growth, certain Council members pointed out that part of the household sector's income came from business activity.",
        "During the discussion, it was pointed out that annual growth in lending to households had increased in recent months, boosted by the “2% Safe Mortgage” programme, while monthly housing loan growth was decreasing after the closure of the acceptance of applications under this programme.",
        "It was observed that in June 2024, the so-called loan repayment holidays in their new form had taken effect.",
        "At the same time, annual corporate loan growth remains close to zero.",
        "At the meeting, it was indicated that – according to the Statistics Poland flash estimate – in May 2024 CPI inflation stood at 2.5% y/y.",
        "It was underlined that price growth had been in line with the medium-term inflation target (of 2.5% +/- 1 percentage points) for the fourth consecutive month.",
        "In May, annual energy price growth, including fuels, increased.",
        "Attention was drawn to the slightly slower annual growth in the prices of food and non alcoholic beverages, suggesting that strong competition in the retail market continued to affect prices.",
        "It was estimated that inflation net of food and energy prices had decreased again in May, with the decline being probably slightly deeper than market forecasts.",
        "However, it was underlined that this measure of core inflation remained higher than headline CPI inflation, as a result – in particular – of the still elevated service price growth, amid high wage growth with the relatively high share of wages in this sector’s costs.",
        "Certain Council members indicated at that point that despite the rising demand for services, annual service price growth had not been rising in recent months.",
        "The Council members pointed out that the sharp annual fall in producer prices had continued recently, confirming the fading of most external supply shocks and cost pressure reduction.",
        "Together with the relatively low – despite some acceleration – economic activity growth, this was conducive to limiting inflation.",
        "It was judged that inflation was also curbed by the appreciation of the zloty exchange rate, which was consistent with the fundamentals of the Polish economy.",
        "The majority of Council members indicated that the current level of interest rates was a factor that should limit inflationary pressure also in the medium term.",
        "At the same time, certain Council members pointed to a slight increase in the measures of consumer inflation expectations in the recent period.",
        "When discussing the inflation outlook, Council members pointed out that according to the available forecasts, in 2024 Q2 CPI inflation would remain at a level consistent with the NBP inflation target.",
        "In the second half of 2024, in turn, should energy prices increase, inflation will rise according to forecasts and exceed the NBP inflation target.",
        "At the same time, the Council members noted that energy price developments in the subsequent quarters were still subject to uncertainty, including that related to the future decisions of the President of the Energy Regulatory Office.",
        "When referring to the medium-term inflation outlook, it was pointed out that the expected energy price growth in the second half of 2024 might, on the one hand, reduce demand pressure on other consumer goods and services, yet on the other hand, it might affect inflation expectations.",
        "The Council members observed that further wage developments and the degree of pass-through of wage growth to consumer demand were also a factor of uncertainty.",
        "At the same time, it was judged that the deterioration in the financial results of enterprises in 2024 Q1 might limit the headroom for companies to absorb the rising wages.",
        "Certain Council members pointed out that companies’ financial performance may vary depending on their size.",
        "The Council members noted that fiscal policy remained a risk factor for the inflation outlook.",
        "It was stressed that so far some of the proposed fiscal measures had still not been implemented, such as the increase in the amount of social benefits or the introduction of new ones.",
        "At the same time, attention was drawn to the fact that Poland might become subject to the excessive deficit procedure, although at this stage it was difficult to assess what impact it would have on fiscal policy in the coming years.",
        "The persistence of other significant sources of uncertainty was also underlined, including the tense geopolitical situation, commodity price developments and the economic conditions in Poland’s main trading partners.",
        "The majority of Council members assessed that despite the observed economic recovery, demand and cost pressures in the Polish economy remained low, which, amidst weakened economic conditions and lower inflation pressure abroad, curbed domestic inflation.",
        "As a result, in 2024 Q2 annual CPI growth will run at the level consistent with the NBP inflation target.",
        "This will be accompanied by lower than in the previous quarters inflation net of food and energy prices, although – due to elevated growth in service prices – it will stay above the CPI inflation.",
        "In subsequent quarters, inflation developments are, however, associated with substantial uncertainty related i.a.",
        "to the impact of fiscal and regulatory policies on price developments, including on inflation expectations, as well as the pace of economic recovery in Poland and labour market conditions.",
        "It was emphasised that should energy prices be raised, inflation would increase in the second half of 2024.",
        "Alongside that, over the medium term demand pressure in the economy will be stimulated by a marked wage growth, stemming, among others, from wage increases in the public sector.",
        "Against this background, the Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged.",
        "The Council judged that the current level of the NBP interest rates was conducive to meeting the NBP inflation target in the medium term.",
        "A view was expressed that given the elevated core inflation, as well as the recovery in consumer demand and high wage growth, the current level of NBP interest rates was too low to ensure the sustainable return of inflation to the target in the medium term.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 5.75%, the lombard rate at 6.25%, the deposit rate at 5.25%, the rediscount rate at 5.80%, and the discount rate at 5.85%.",
        "The Council members pointed out that further decisions of the Council would depend on incoming information regarding prospects for inflation and economic activity.",
        "At the meeting, it was noted that the euro area was stagnant in 2023 Q4 and GDP in Germany had fallen.",
        "In contrast, economic conditions in the United States remained favourable and the labour market situation was even better than expected.",
        "At the same time, it was observed that the disinflation process was proceeding in the environment of the Polish economy.",
        "In particular, core inflation in the largest advanced economies continued to gradually decline and recently a significant fall in the global prices of most energy commodities had also been recorded.",
        "At the meeting, it was pointed out that – according to the Statistics Poland preliminary estimate – GDP growth in Poland stood at 0.2% in 2023.",
        "The Council members indicated that this implied a certain acceleration in GDP growth in 2023 Q4, which was in line with the NBP November projection and was evidence of a gradual economic recovery.",
        "At the same time, it was observed that monthly data for December showed a year-on-year decline in retail sales, a fall – although smaller than market expectations – in industrial output, and a strong rise in construction and assembly output.",
        "In turn, certain Council members underlined that the situation in many industrial sections had been improving steadily for several months.",
        "Some Council members judged that the available data confirmed that despite the recovery, GDP growth was still relatively subdued and significantly lower than the potential of the Polish economy.",
        "In the opinion of these Council members, going forward the economic recovery could be expected to continue – above all, due to the anticipated higher growth in consumption – although its scale was subject to uncertainty.",
        "It was pointed out that consumption growth would be boosted by the pick-up in growth of real household income, amid lower inflation, which would be accompanied by an increase in the minimum wage, indexation of social benefits and wage increases in the public sector.",
        "Yet, some Council members judged that households’ efforts to rebuild savings could weigh visibly on the outlook for consumer demand.",
        "When referring to the labour market conditions, it was indicated that they were still good as reflected, in particular, in the low unemployment rate.",
        "The scale of the fall in employment in the enterprise sector was also slightly smaller in year-on-year terms.",
        "Alongside that, certain Council members underlined that the number of people working under other forms of employment relationship than an employment contract was rising.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that in December 2023 annual nominal wage growth in the enterprise sector had fallen below 10%, although it was argued that – taking into account the minimum wage increases and the wage rises for public sector employees – wage growth could rise significantly in 2024 Q1.",
        "Moreover, certain Council members observed that at the end of 2023 real wage growth was higher than in previous quarters, and was not accompanied by a marked improvement in labour productivity.",
        "According to the majority of the Council members, the effects of NBP earlier monetary policy tightening could still be seen in the credit market.",
        "In the opinion of these Council members, this is particularly evidenced by the fact that the ratio of credit of the private non-financial sector to GDP was much lower than before the pandemic.",
        "At the same time, a recovery in the credit market was noted, which was attributable to the so-called “Safe Mortgage” programme.",
        "Certain Council members also indicated a rise in the stock of both consumer and corporate loans.",
        "At the meeting, it was observed that the annual inflation rate in December 2023 had declined to 6.2%, which meant that it was almost three times lower than its peak in February 2023.",
        "The Council members underlined that the fall in the CPI index was not only the result of lower commodity prices or statistical base effects, since the monthly growth of the majority of price categories had declined to their long-term averages.",
        "Additionally, it was noted that in December core inflation had fallen yet again, driven by weakened demand pressure and the earlier monetary policy tightening, although it remained elevated.",
        "Some Council members drew attention to the fact that in December the fall in industrial producer prices had also deepened, which evidenced the fading of the earlier external supply shocks and weak cost pressure.",
        "It was judged that the decline in inflation was being supported by the appreciation of the zloty exchange rate, which was consistent with the fundamentals of the Polish economy.",
        "When discussing the short-term inflation outlook in Poland, it was pointed out that a further fall in price growth was expected at the beginning of 2024.",
        "As at the January meeting, the Council members observed that in 2024 Q1 inflation would most likely be lower than predicted in the NBP November projection.",
        "It was judged that according to current forecasts, the CPI index might fall below 3% in March 2024, i.e.",
        "to a level consistent with the NBP inflation target of 2.5% +/-1 percentage point.",
        "At the same time, the Council members underlined that core inflation would also ease, although at a slower pace, and consequently it would remain higher than headline inflation.",
        "In this context, the Council members expressed the opinion that developments in core inflation were of significant importance for the assessment of domestic inflation processes.",
        "Certain Council members emphasised that a further marked fall in inflation at the beginning of 2024 – with unchanged interest rates – would be a factor pushing up real interest rates.",
        "When discussing the longer-term inflation outlook, the Council members upheld the assessment that price dynamics in the coming quarters would depend on regulatory and fiscal decisions and were subject to high uncertainty.",
        "It was pointed out that, according to the current regulations, the zero VAT rate on food products was supposed to be in place until the end of March 2024, while the prices of gas, electricity and district heating for households were to remain frozen until the end of June 2024.",
        "It was observed that assuming no increase in the VAT rate on food and unchanged energy prices until the end of the year, inflation might remain at a level consistent with the NBP inflation target from February until the end of 2024.",
        "However, should the VAT rate on food products be restored from zero to 5% and should subsidies to energy prices be totally or partially removed, inflation might rise significantly in the second half of 2024.",
        "Moreover, some Council members drew attention to the fact that risks around the inflation path included developments in commodity prices and the return of tensions in international trade due to the situation in the Red Sea, which had caused a sharp increase in freight prices in recent months.",
        "Also, when discussing the longer-term outlook for core inflation, the Council members underlined that uncertainty persisted about its further path, which was related to, in particular, the pace of economic recovery in Poland and its impact on inflationary pressure.",
        "Some Council members judged that the significant rise in public sector wages would be a factor that could boost core inflation.",
        "This was because it would push up wage growth in the whole economy as well as consumer demand.",
        "The implementation of other fiscal measures, such as an increase in the tax-free allowance, could have a similar effect, although some Council members emphasised that currently it was not clear whether and to what degree these proposals would be implemented.",
        "In this context, certain Council members pointed out that – particularly in view of the need for increased public expenditure on the military and on energy transformation – the room for increasing the expansiveness of fiscal policy was limited and rather consolidation policies should be expected.",
        "The majority of the Council members assessed that despite the observed economic recovery, demand and cost pressures in the Polish economy remained low, which amidst the weakened economic conditions and fading inflationary pressure abroad would support lower price growth in Poland.",
        "In 2024 Q1, the annual CPI growth is likely to fall significantly, while the decline in core inflation will be slower.",
        "However, inflation developments in subsequent quarters are subject to high uncertainty, related in particular to the impact of fiscal and regulatory policies on price developments, as well as the pace of economic recovery in Poland.",
        "It was emphasised that should higher VAT rate on food products be restored and energy prices raised, inflation might rise significantly in the second half of 2024.",
        "At the same time, higher nominal wage growth, including due to increases in public sector wages, would contribute to higher demand pressure in the economy.",
        "Under these circumstances, the Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged.",
        "The Council judged that the current level of the NBP interest rates was conducive to meeting the NBP inflation target in the medium term.",
        "Certain Council members expressed the opinion that given the persistently high annual price growth and elevated inflation expectations, as well as amid the expected further recovery in demand and the fiscal measures launched, the level of the NBP interest rates was too low to ensure the return of inflation to the target in the medium term and to lower inflation expectations to levels consistent with the medium-term inflation target.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 5.75%, the lombard rate at 6.25%, the deposit rate at 5.25%, the rediscount rate at 5.80%, and the discount rate at 5.85%.",
        "The Council members pointed out that further decisions of the Council would depend on incoming information regarding prospects for inflation and economic activity.",
        "During the discussion at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council, it was noted that economic conditions in the immediate environment of the Polish economy remained weakened.",
        "The Council members emphasised that incoming data suggested that in 2024 Q3, annual GDP growth in the euro area, including Germany – the Poland’s main trading partner – probably continued to be low.",
        "It was highlighted that in Germany, available data for 2024 Q3 signalled that the country had seen a further industrial output decline, which, coupled with other information from this economy, led to forecasts of economic recovery in Germany being repeatedly put off.",
        "The Council members expressed the view that the problems of the German economy might largely be of structural nature.",
        "It was noted that the weak economic conditions in Germany have an unfavourable impact on activity of Polish industrial enterprises, particularly exporters.",
        "Alongside that, it was emphasised that GDP growth in the United States probably remained high, although unemployment in this economy was somewhat higher in recent months than at the beginning of 2024.",
        "When discussing inflation developments abroad, the Council members observed that price growth in the largest advanced economies had declined in recent months to levels close to their central banks’ inflation targets.",
        "At the same time, core inflation – both in the euro area and the United States – remains higher than headline inflation.",
        "The Council members underlined that core inflation continued to be elevated also in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, which was related to high services price growth and a fast nominal wage growth.",
        "During the discussion it was pointed out that in September 2024, the European Central Bank had cut interest rates once again.",
        "It was observed that the US Federal Reserve had also decided to cut interest rates in September, and the scale of the reduction, which was the first cut after a period of keeping interest rates unchanged, was larger than expected by most analysts.",
        "While discussing economic activity in Poland, it was noted that a gradual economic recovery was under way in the first half of 2024, with recently incoming data being mixed.",
        "It was underscored that a rise in consumer demand, pushed up by real income growth, was likely to be the primary driver of GDP growth.",
        "Yet, it was observed that in July and August 2024, retail sales growth was slower than in 2024 Q2 and real retail sales were running at a level close to that seen two years ago.",
        "In turn, consumer confidence improved somewhat in September 2024.",
        "The Council members emphasised that available data pointed to the still low activity in the manufacturing sector.",
        "In August 2024, industrial output declined by 1.5% y/y, with output growth being still significantly higher in the sections more domestic oriented than export oriented, due to weak demand from Poland’s main trading partners.",
        "When referring to the labour market situation, it was observed that annual wage growth in the enterprise sector was weaker than at the beginning of the year, but its decline was slow and, in effect, wage growth remained double-digit.",
        "Certain Council members pointed out that monthly wage growth in the enterprise sector also remained relatively high.",
        "At the same time, employment in the enterprise sector continues to decrease, and in August even somewhat more deeply.",
        "During the discussion, attention was drawn to the gradually increasing annual growth in the value of bank loans, both to households and enterprises.",
        "However, it was emphasised that annual growth in housing loans continued to be boosted by the effects of the terminated “Safe Mortgage” programme.",
        "At the meeting, it was observed that according to the Statistics Poland flash estimate, in September 2024 CPI inflation stood at 4.9% y/y (compared with 4.3% in August 2024).",
        "The Council members noted that the rise in inflation in recent months resulted mainly from increases in the administered prices of energy carriers and – though to a lesser extent – an increase in annual growth in the prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages.",
        "At the same time, attention was drawn to the fact that core inflation had probably also risen in September, due to, on the one hand, base effects, in particular related to the prices of medical and pharmaceutical products, and on the other – persistently high estimated growth in services prices, attributed to the still elevated wage growth.",
        "Nevertheless, it was emphasised that inflation net of food and energy prices remained lower than CPI inflation.",
        "The Council members observed that the increase in inflation in 2024 Q3 was in line with earlier predictions, in particular with the July projection of inflation and GDP.",
        "In August 2024 the marked fall in industrial producer prices in annual terms continued.",
        "The majority of the Council members emphasised that the increase in administered prices of energy carriers was a supply shock remaining beyond the impact of the domestic monetary policy.",
        "While discussing the inflation outlook, the Council members pointed out that in 2024 Q4 price growth, including inflation net of food and energy prices, might remain at a similar level as in September 2024.",
        "It was emphasised that in 2025 Q1 headline inflation might increase further, yet the scale of this rise was subject to uncertainty related to decisions on administered prices of energy carriers.",
        "Certain Council members indicated in this context that no pass-through of energy carriers price growth to wage growth and inflation expectations had so far been observed, yet it was too early to assess whether this situation would continue.",
        "It was also emphasised that – apart from possible changes in the prices of energy carriers – higher CPI growth in 2025 would additionally be driven by the increases in the excise tax on alcohol and tobacco products assumed in the draft Budget Act.",
        "As regards core inflation, certain Council members also pointed out that – according to the current forecasts – core inflation would remain elevated in the subsequent quarters.",
        "It was noted that fiscal policy is one of the risk factors for the medium-term inflation outlook.",
        "It was assessed that – despite the fact that the excessive deficit procedure had formally been launched – the draft Budget Act for 2025 did not indicate a tightening of fiscal policy, which would be conducive to limiting inflationary pressures.",
        "Certain Council members pointed out that not only the size of the expenditure but also its structure was important for assessing the impact of fiscal policy on inflation developments.",
        "The Council members indicated that also the strength of economic recovery and further developments in the labour market were important risk factors for future inflation developments.",
        "Those Council members also highlighted uncertainty about commodity prices, in particular amid mounted tensions in the Middle East.",
        "Moreover, certain Council members pointed out the risks related to food prices.",
        "The majority of the Council members assessed that despite the observed economic recovery, demand and cost pressures in the Polish economy remained relatively low, which, amid weakened economic conditions and lower inflation pressure abroad, curbed domestic inflation pressure.",
        "Consumer price growth is also constrained by the appreciation of the zloty exchange rate, which is consistent with the fundamentals of the Polish economy.",
        "However, price pressures in the domestic economy are stimulated by a marked wage growth, stemming, among others, from wage increases in the public sector.",
        "Alongside that, the rise in prices of energy carriers increases inflation significantly.",
        "This factor will continue to affect the annual inflation rate in the coming quarters.",
        "When the effects of the energy price increase fade – amid the current NBP interest rates level – inflation should return to the medium-term NBP target, although the impact of higher energy prices on inflation expectations is an uncertainty factor.",
        "The inflation developments over the medium term will be also affected by the further fiscal and regulatory policy measures, the pace of economic recovery in Poland and labour market conditions.",
        "Against this background, the Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged.",
        "The Council judged that the current level of the NBP interest rates was conducive to meeting the NBP inflation target in the medium term.",
        "A view was expressed that given the elevated inflation – including inflation net of food and energy prices – particularly amid high wage growth, the current level of NBP interest rates, amid the current developments in inflation expectations, was too low to ensure a sustainable return of inflation to the target in the medium term.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 5.75%, the lombard rate at 6.25%, the deposit rate at 5.25%, the rediscount rate at 5.80%, and the discount rate at 5.85%.",
        "The Council members pointed out that further decisions of the Council would depend on incoming information regarding prospects for inflation and economic activity.",
        "During the discussion at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council it was noted that the economic conditions in the immediate environment of the Polish economy remained weakened.",
        "In 2024 Q2 annual GDP growth in the euro area remained low.",
        "It was emphasised that particularly weak economic conditions persisted in Germany, where in 2024 Q2 annual, seasonally adjusted GDP growth was 0%.",
        "Incoming data for 2024 Q3 in this economy also remained weak, indicating that the prospect of recovery has again receded.",
        "It was pointed out that the weak economic conditions in Germany might have an unfavourable impact on economic activity in Polish industry, particularly in the export sector.",
        "On the other hand, it was underlined that in the United States GDP growth remained high (slightly exceeding 3% y/y in 2024 Q2), although the unemployment rate was gradually rising.",
        "When discussing inflation processes abroad, the Council members noted that in the largest economies price growth continued to run slightly above the inflation targets, although it had declined slightly in recent months.",
        "According to Eurostat flash estimate, inflation in the euro area fell to 2.2% in August.",
        "In the United States CPI inflation declined to 2.9% in July.",
        "It was pointed out that the process of lowering inflation in the major economies was slow as core inflation remained elevated, particularly due to the persistence of high service price growth amid fast wage growth.",
        "The Council members pointed out that, following an earlier interest rates cut in June 2024, the European Central Bank decided to keep interest rates unchanged in July 2024.",
        "At the same time, the Federal Reserve of the United States had continued to stabilise interest rates in the recent period.",
        "It was pointed out that, amid a gradual decline in inflation in the major economies alongside the persistence of weak economic conditions in the euro area and growing unemployment in the United States, most financial market participants expected interest rates cuts in these economies in the coming months.",
        "At the same time, it was emphasised that interest rates in the environment of the Polish economy were significantly higher than the average for the years preceding the COVID-19 pandemic.",
        "While discussing economic activity in Poland, it was noted that a gradual economic recovery was under way, although incoming data were mixed.",
        "According to Statistics Poland preliminary estimate, annual GDP growth stood at 3.2% in 2024 Q2 and was slightly higher than indicated by the July projection.",
        "A positive impact on GDP growth was primarily from growth in consumer demand, driven by strong growth in real incomes.",
        "Certain Council members drew attention to the positive annual growth in gross fixed capital formation in 2024 Q2, which was difficult to forecast, particularly taking into account the fall in investment in the sector of large and medium-sized enterprises.",
        "On the other hand, net exports had a negative contribution to GDP growth.",
        "Monthly data also point to a weakening of exports.",
        "It was pointed out that in July 2024 retail sales and industrial output posted positive annual growth; however, these increases were weaker than expected and growth in industrial output was mainly the result of the greater number of working days.",
        "The PMI index also did not show an improvement in the business conditions in manufacturing sector.",
        "It was assessed that the weakness of demand in Poland’s main trading partners had a negative impact on economic conditions in industry, particularly in the export sector.",
        "Some Council members pointed out that – following a previous marked decline – profitability ratios in the non-financial enterprise sector had improved in 2024 Q2.",
        "When referring to the labour market situation, it was noted that wage growth remained at an elevated, double-digit level.",
        "Wage growth in the national economy in 2024 Q2 proved to be faster than expected, which, however, was partly the result of the postponed effects of wage increases for teachers and some other public sector employees.",
        "It was indicated that a gradual decline in wage growth could be seen in the enterprise sector.",
        "Alongside that, it was noted that in July 2024 nominal wage growth in annual terms had slowed down, although it was mainly the effect of a sharp fall in wages in mining.",
        "It was underlined that the decline in wage growth – along with higher inflation – had translated into a slowdown in real wage growth in July 2024.",
        "At the same time, employment in the enterprise sector, primarily in industry, remained lower than a year earlier.",
        "Certain Council members underlined that dynamic wage growth was seen in many sectors of the economy and in surveys companies still often declared their willingness to increase wages over the next quarter, while the average scale of these planned increases was – in the assessment of these Council members – relatively high.",
        "During the discussion, attention was drawn to the rising value of household loans in annual terms amid still low growth in corporate loans.",
        "It was pointed out that the annual growth in housing loans continued to be boosted by the effects of the now terminated “Safe Mortgage” programme.",
        "At the same time, monthly increases in housing loans denominated in PLN were positive in recent months, although lower than at the beginning of the year.",
        "Consumer credit is also on a steady rise.",
        "Certain Council members pointed out that the so-called loan repayment holidays were contributing to an increase in disposable income of some households.",
        "At the meeting it was noted that in the first half of 2024 average inflation amounted to 2.7%, and was thus consistent with the inflation target.",
        "According to the Statistics Poland flash estimate, annual CPI inflation was 4.3% in August 2024 (compared to 4.2% in July 2024 and 2.6% in June 2024).",
        "The rise in inflation against June was mainly a result of increases in administered prices of energy carriers, as well as – albeit to a lesser extent – an increase in annual growth in prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages.",
        "At the same time, inflation net of food and energy prices was relatively stable in recent months following an earlier decline.",
        "It was assessed that service price growth was relatively high.",
        "In July 2024 the marked fall in industrial producer prices in annual terms continued.",
        "The majority of the Council members assessed that the rise in administered prices of energy carriers was a supply shock beyond the control of domestic monetary policy.",
        "Some members of the Council emphasised that current inflation was below the level of the NBP reference rate.",
        "Certain Council members noted that elevated price growth was observed in a large group of consumer goods and services.",
        "While discussing the inflation outlook, the Council members pointed out that CPI inflation, including inflation net of food and energy prices, would probably rise somewhat in the coming period.",
        "Attention was drawn to the fact that in 2025 Q1 price growth might rise further, whereas the scale of this growth was fraught with uncertainty connected with decisions concerning administered prices of energy carriers.",
        "It was also emphasized that the increase in excise tax on alcohol assumed in the preliminary draft Budget Act, and much stronger increase in excise tax on tobacco products than planned in the so-called road map, would contribute to higher CPI growth in 2025.",
        "Certain Council members noted that according to the forecasts, core inflation would remain elevated in the coming quarters.",
        "It was noted that the fiscal policy was one of the risk factors for the inflation outlook in the medium term.",
        "According to the preliminary draft Budget Act, the government is planning the 2025 public finance sector deficit in ESA2010 terms at the level of 5.5% of GDP, considerably above the level announced by the government in April 2024.",
        "It was assessed that – although the excessive deficit procedure had officially been initiated – the preliminary draft Budget Act for 2025 did not indicate fiscal policy tightening which would favour a reduction in inflationary pressure.",
        "Some Council members also indicated that not only the size of expenditure, but also its type structure were of considerable importance for inflation developments.",
        "The majority of Council members assessed that despite the observed economic recovery, demand and cost pressures in the Polish economy remained relatively low, which, amid weakened economic conditions and lower inflation pressure abroad, curbed domestic inflation pressure.",
        "Consumer price growth is also constrained by the appreciation of the zloty exchange rate, which is consistent with the fundamentals of the Polish economy.",
        "However, price pressure in the domestic economy is stimulated by a marked wage growth, stemming, among others, from wage increases in the public sector.",
        "Alongside that, the rise in prices of energy carriers increases inflation significantly.",
        "This factor will continue to affect the annual inflation rate in the coming quarters.",
        "When the effects of the energy price increase fade – amid the current NBP interest rates level – inflation should return to the medium-term NBP target, although the impact of higher energy prices on inflation expectations is an uncertainty factor.",
        "The inflation developments over the medium term will be also affected by the further fiscal and regulatory policy measures, the pace of economic recovery in Poland and the labour market conditions.",
        "Against this background, the Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged.",
        "The Council judged that the current level of the NBP interest rates was conducive to meeting the NBP inflation target in the medium term.",
        "A view was expressed that given the elevated inflation – including inflation net of food and energy prices – as well as the recovery in consumer demand and high wage growth, the current level of NBP interest rates, amid the current developments in inflation expectations, was too low to ensure the sustainable return of inflation to the target in the medium term.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 5.75%, the lombard rate at 6.25%, the deposit rate at 5.25%, the rediscount rate at 5.80%, and the discount rate at 5.85%.",
        "The Council members pointed out that further decisions of the Council would depend on incoming information regarding prospects for inflation and economic activity.",
        "During the discussion at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council it was noted that signs of recovery were visible in the global economy, although economic activity remained weakened in the euro area – Poland’s main trading partner – where GDP growth was probably only slightly positive in 2024 Q1.",
        "In Germany, economic activity may have further declined in 2024 Q1, with particularly weak business conditions in the country’s industrial sector.",
        "It was underlined that the growth forecast for Germany had recently been revised downwards and currently indicated a more marked recovery in the German economy only in 2025.",
        "When discussing inflation developments abroad, the Council members noted that despite a sharp fall in annual price growth in many countries in recent quarters, in some of them inflation was still above inflation targets.",
        "At the same time, core inflation in a range of advanced economies, as well as in the economies of the Central and Eastern Europe region, remained higher than headline inflation.",
        "The Council members pointed out that in many countries the fall in core inflation was hampered by the still high growth in service prices, which was declining only slowly due to the continued elevated nominal wage growth.",
        "When discussing economic activity in Poland, the Council members judged that incoming data indicated an economic recovery.",
        "It was pointed out that in January and February 2024 retail sales and industrial output had risen significantly in annual terms, following falls throughout most of 2023.",
        "At the same time, at the beginning of 2024 construction and assembly output had declined in annual terms.",
        "When referring to the labour market conditions, it was noticed that nominal wage growth in the enterprise sector had remained high in February 2024.",
        "The Council members underlined that amid a further fall in inflation in February 2024, real wage growth in the enterprise sector was running at its highest level in many years.",
        "It was, however, also pointed out that a further slight fall in employment had taken place in the enterprise sector.",
        "During the discussion it was noted that growth in zloty-denominated loans to households was increasing.",
        "In the opinion of the Council members, this continued to be underpinned by the so-called “Safe Mortgage” programme.",
        "At the same time, it was stressed that annual growth in corporate loans remained negative, mainly due to a fall in the stock of current loans.",
        "When discussing the economic outlook, the Council members judged that activity growth would probably pick up in the coming quarters.",
        "The Council members indicated that, in particular, this would be driven by the favourable prospects for domestic demand in view of the elevated wage growth, including due to the increase in the minimum wage and wage rises in the public sector.",
        "At the same time, the scale of the economic recovery was subject to uncertainty, while one of the risk factors for the outlook was further development of the economic situation in Poland’s main trading partners.",
        "At the meeting it was noted that in February and March 2024 annual consumer price growth was running at a level consistent with the NBP inflation target.",
        "In February CPI inflation had declined to 2.8%, and in March, according to the Statistics Poland flash estimate, it had fallen to 1.9% – therefore, within thirteen months since reaching its peak, inflation had fallen by over 16 p.p.",
        "The Council members noticed that in a relatively short time price growth had declined significantly, while the social and economic costs of disinflation had been limited.",
        "Certain Council members drew attention to the fact that in February 2024 annual price growth of a significant proportion of goods and services included in the CPI basket still exceeded 3.5%.",
        "The Council members pointed out that the fall in CPI inflation had been accompanied by a significant decline in the measures of core inflation, which – according to available estimates – had probably also taken place in March 2024.",
        "However, it was noted that inflation excluding food and energy prices remained elevated, and, in particular, it was higher than headline CPI inflation.",
        "Certain Council stressed the continuously high – albeit gradually declining – annual growth in service prices.",
        "At the same time – although certain Council members noticed that the monthly change in industrial producer prices had been slightly positive in February 2024 – producer prices had continued to fall sharply in annual terms, confirming the fading of most of the external supply shocks and the limited cost pressure.",
        "Together with the relatively low – despite some acceleration – economic activity growth it was conducive to a decline in inflation.",
        "It was judged that the decrease in inflation was supported also by the appreciation of the zloty exchange rate, which was consistent with the fundamentals of the Polish economy.",
        "Some Council members pointed out that the observed fall in inflation – under unchanged interest rates – was contributing to a rise in real interest rates, which should limit inflationary pressure also in the medium term.",
        "When discussing the inflation outlook, Council members pointed out that according to available forecasts, in the first half of 2024 CPI inflation would run at a level consistent with the NBP inflation target of 2.5% ± 1 p.p., although it would most likely rise in the coming months.",
        "The increase in inflation in the near future would be attributable to the restoration of the VAT rate on food from zero to 5%.",
        "At the same time, the Council members noted that developments in energy prices in the subsequent quarters were subject to high uncertainty.",
        "Should subsidies to energy prices be fully or partially removed, inflation would rise significantly in the second half of 2024, exceeding the NBP inflation target.",
        "In turn, should energy prices be kept unchanged, inflation in the second half of 2024 would rise much weaker, running close to the upper limit of deviations from the inflation target.",
        "When referring to the medium-term outlook, it was pointed out that the potential increase of inflation in the second half of 2024 might also influence inflation expectations.",
        "Attention was drawn to the fact that the observed economic recovery and expected growth in demand pressure, in particular due to high wage growth, including in the public sector, would contribute to higher prices.",
        "Some Council members noted that the further development of wage growth was the main risk factor for the medium-term inflation outlook, and the persistence of elevated wage growth may delay a sustainable return of CPI inflation to the target.",
        "At the same time, certain Council members pointed out that the transmission of higher wages to prices might depend on many factors, including the speed of the recovery in domestic economic activity, changes in corporate profitability, and also the households’ propensity to save.",
        "In addition, the Council members indicated that the possible implementation of proposed fiscal measures, such as the increase in the amount of social benefits or introduction of new ones, might also boost demand growth, and as a result, lead to higher inflation, including core inflation.",
        "However, certain Council members argued that the room for increasing the expansiveness of fiscal policy was limited, especially in view of the need for increased public expenditure for military purposes.",
        "The persistence of other significant sources of uncertainty was also underlined, including, among others, the tense geopolitical situation, commodity price developments and the economic conditions in the environment of the Polish economy.",
        "The majority of the Council members assessed that despite the observed economic recovery, demand and cost pressures in the Polish economy remained low, which amidst weakened economic conditions and falling inflation pressure abroad supported lower domestic inflation.",
        "As a result, it was expected that in the coming months annual CPI growth would run at the level consistent with the NBP inflation target, however, restoring higher VAT on food products would act toward the rise in inflation.",
        "This will be accompanied by a gradual decline in core inflation, although core inflation will stay above CPI inflation.",
        "In subsequent quarters, inflation developments are, however, associated with substantial uncertainty, related in particular to the impact of fiscal and regulatory policies on price developments, as well as the pace of economic recovery in Poland and labour market conditions.",
        "It was emphasised that should energy prices be raised, inflation might rise significantly in the second half of 2024.",
        "Alongside that, over the medium term, demand pressure in the economy will be stimulated by wage growth, stemming i.a.",
        "from wage increases in the public sector.",
        "Against this background, the Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged.",
        "The Council judged that the current level of the NBP interest rates was conducive to meeting the NBP inflation target in the medium term.",
        "A view was expressed that given the elevated core inflation, as well as the expected further recovery in demand and high wage growth, the current level of NBP interest rates was too low to ensure the sustainable return of inflation to the target in the medium term.",
        "When referring to the possible future decisions, some Council members assessed that, considering current macroeconomic conditions, it can be justified to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged at subsequent meetings.",
        "In turn, certain Council members expressed the opinion that should risks contributing to higher inflation in the medium term materialise in the coming quarters, the need of increasing the interest rates in the future cannot be excluded.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 5.75%, the lombard rate at 6.25%, the deposit rate at 5.25%, the rediscount rate at 5.80%, and the discount rate at 5.85%.",
        "The Council members pointed out that further decisions of the Council would depend on incoming information regarding prospects for inflation and economic activity.",
        "During the discussion at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council it was noted that the economic conditions in Poland’s main trading partners was gradually improving, but remained markedly weakened.",
        "It was pointed out that in 2024 Q1 consumption growth in the euro area had been lower than households’ real disposable income growth, which indicated that households may have used part of their income to increase savings.",
        "In 2024 Q2 GDP growth in this economy was probably low again, and, in particular, in Germany annual GDP growth may have been close to zero.",
        "It was underlined that activity in Europe's industrial sector was particularly weakened, while in services the situation is relatively better.",
        "It was mentioned that forecasts for the next quarters indicated a rather gradual economic recovery in the euro area.",
        "In turn, the economic situation in the United States was still markedly better than in the euro area and, according to available forecasts, it would remain so in the coming periods.",
        "When discussing inflation processes abroad, the Council members noted that in many economies price growth continued to run slightly above the inflation targets of the central banks.",
        "At the same time, it was stressed that in the largest advanced economies core inflation was higher than headline inflation.",
        "This is due to the still elevated service price growth amid a strong disinflation of goods prices.",
        "The Council members drew attention to the fact that the European Central Bank had cut interest rates in June 2024.",
        "Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve of the United States continued to keep interest rates unchanged.",
        "While discussing economic activity in Poland, the Council members assessed that a gradual economic recovery was continuing, although recent data were mixed.",
        "It was pointed out that annual GDP growth in 2024 Q2 had probably been higher than in 2024 Q1.",
        "When analysing monthly data, it was observed that retail sales had risen by 5% in annual terms in May 2024.",
        "In turn, industrial as well as construction and assembly output in May were lower than a year ago.",
        "It was underlined that the poor condition of the industrial sector was also evidenced by sentiment indicators, including the PMI index, which was probably partly connected with the ongoing downturn in the German industry.",
        "With regard to the labour market conditions, it was noted that in May wage growth in the enterprise sector was slightly higher than in April, which amid only slightly higher inflation meant that real wage growth remained high.",
        "At the same time, employment in this sector declined once again, particularly in industrial enterprises.",
        "During the discussion, attention was drawn to the rise in value of household consumption loans in the recent period, while noting that in the case of housing loans their monthly increases were declining.",
        "The weakening of lending in the housing loans segment was probably related to the closure of the applications acceptance for the “Safe Mortgage” programme.",
        "It was also pointed out that the so-called repayment holidays boosted disposable income of some households.",
        "While discussing the financial situation of consumers, certain Council members indicated that in recent years households’ bank debt had fallen, particularly in real terms.",
        "The Council members highlighted that annual corporate credit growth remained low.",
        "Referring to the economic activity outlook, the Council members pointed out that according to the July projection the economic recovery should continue in the coming quarters.",
        "Therefore, GDP growth would probably be higher in 2025 than in 2024 whereas, according to the projection, in the following year it may slow down slightly.",
        "At the meeting it was noted that according to the Statistics Poland flash estimate, CPI inflation was 2.6% y/y in June 2024 (compared to 2.5% in May).",
        "It was underlined that for a second consecutive quarter price growth was in line with the NBP medium-term inflation target (2.5% +/- 1 p.p.).",
        "Annual growth in prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages rose in June 2024, while annual growth in energy prices declined.",
        "It was estimated that in June inflation net of food and energy prices had once again decreased, although it remained higher than the CPI inflation.",
        "This was a result, in particular, of the still elevated growth in services prices due to high wage growth, amid the relatively high share of wages in the costs of the service sector.",
        "The Council members pointed out that the sharp annual fall in producer prices had continued recently, confirming the fading of most external supply shocks and cost pressure reduction.",
        "Together with the relatively low – despite some acceleration – economic activity growth, this was conducive to limiting inflation.",
        "It was judged that inflation was also curbed by the appreciation of the zloty exchange rate, which was consistent with the fundamentals of the Polish economy.",
        "The majority of the Council members indicated that the current level of interest rates was a factor which should limit inflationary pressure also in the medium term.",
        "Certain Council members were of the opinion that given the anticipated increase in inflation in the coming quarters and the related possible rise in inflation expectations, real interest rates would decrease.",
        "When discussing the inflation outlook, the Council members noted that according to the July projection, inflation would probably increase in the subsequent quarters, running at a level markedly above the NBP inflation target.",
        "It was emphasised that this would take place amid the ongoing economic recovery and the strong rise in wages.",
        "It was pointed out that, in these circumstances, what mattered for the medium-term outlook was how the expected increase in inflation would affect inflation expectations and wage growth, and how households’ propensity to consume and save would evolve.",
        "It was underlined that the acceleration of energy prices in the second half of 2024 should be seen as a supply shock which temporarily boosts inflation but also reduces households’ disposable income.",
        "Certain Council members highlighted the fact that the July projection signalled also higher food price growth in the subsequent quarters stemming from the lagged effects of the VAT rate increase and the higher agricultural commodity prices.",
        "In this context, the Council members pointed out that in line with the Monetary Policy Guidelines, the medium-term nature of the inflation target means that due to macroeconomic and financial shocks, inflation may temporarily deviate from the target and even run outside the band for deviations from the target.",
        "It was emphasised that the response of monetary policy to shocks is flexible and depends on their causes and the assessment of persistence of their consequences, including the impact on inflation developments.",
        "At the same time, it was observed that according to the latest projection, prepared under the assumption of unchanged NBP interest rates, inflation would return to the NBP target in 2026.",
        "This suggests that there is no need for an interest rate rise in response to the anticipated increase in inflation in the coming quarters.",
        "The Council members noted that fiscal policy remained a risk factor for the inflation outlook.",
        "It was stressed that so far some of the proposed fiscal measures had still not been implemented, such as the increase in the amount of social benefits or the introduction of new ones.",
        "At the same time, attention was drawn to the fact that Poland might become subject to the excessive deficit procedure, although at this stage it was difficult to assess what impact it would have on fiscal policy in the coming years.",
        "The persistence of other significant sources of uncertainty was also underlined, including the tense geopolitical situation, commodity price developments and the economic conditions in Poland’s main trading partners.",
        "The majority of Council members assessed that despite the observed economic recovery, demand and cost pressures in the Polish economy remained relatively low, which, amid weakened economic conditions and lower inflation pressure abroad, curbed domestic inflation pressure.",
        "However, demand pressure in the domestic economy is stimulated by a marked wage growth, stemming, i.a.",
        "from wage increases in the public sector.",
        "In the coming quarters, consumer price growth is likely to increase and will be running above the NBP inflation target, which will be driven by higher energy prices.",
        "When the impact of energy price increase fade – amid the current NBP interest rates level – inflation should return to the medium-term NBP target, although the impact of higher energy prices on the inflation expectations is an uncertainty factor.",
        "The inflation developments over the medium term will be also affected by the further fiscal and regulatory policy measures, the pace of economic recovery in Poland and the labour market conditions.",
        "Against this background, the Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged.",
        "The Council judged that the current level of the NBP interest rates was conducive to meeting the NBP inflation target in the medium term.",
        "A view was expressed that given the forecast rise in inflation, as well as the recovery in consumer demand and high wage growth, the current level of NBP interest rates was too low to ensure the sustainable return of inflation to the target in the medium term.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 5.75%, the lombard rate at 6.25%, the deposit rate at 5.25%, the rediscount rate at 5.80%, and the discount rate at 5.85%.",
        "The Council members pointed out that further decisions of the Council would depend on incoming information regarding prospects for inflation and economic activity.",
        "At the meeting, it was noted that the global economic conditions remained weakened, although they varied across the major economies.",
        "It was emphasized that stagnation tendencies continued in the euro area.",
        "The subsequent quarters were expected to see a certain recovery in this economy, yet it was likely to be slow.",
        "By contrast, the economic situation in the United States remained favourable.",
        "It was also pointed out that the pace of economic recovery in China was limited.",
        "It was indicated that uncertainty regarding the outlook for global economic activity – including uncertainty related to the geopolitical situation – persisted.",
        "It was underlined that disinflationary processes continued in the external environment of the Polish economy, although in many countries inflation remained elevated.",
        "It was also pointed out that in December 2023 the annual growth in the prices of consumer goods in the euro area rose, yet it resulted mainly from the statistical base effects of energy prices.",
        "At the same time, core inflation in the euro area continued to decline.",
        "It was pointed out that inflation was also declining in many Central and Eastern European economies.",
        "The Council members indicated that most central banks in advanced economies had been keeping interest rates unchanged.",
        "In turn, in the region of Central and Eastern Europe, central banks of the Czech Republic and Hungary had recently cut interest rates.",
        "At the meeting it was observed that the Polish economy was on a gradual recovery path.",
        "After a rise in October 2023, the annual growth of retail sales and industrial output fell below zero in November 2023, yet remained above the average recorded in previous months.",
        "At the same time, construction and assembly production continued to grow.",
        "It was also emphasized that in 2023 Q4 consumer and business sentiment indicators had been better than in previous quarters.",
        "Consequently, the Council members judged that in 2023 Q4 the annual GDP growth had probably picked up, although remained relatively low.",
        "Certain Council members drew attention to the uncertainty regarding the impact of migration flows between Poland and Ukraine on consumption growth.",
        "While analysing the labour market situation, the Council members noted that it remained good, as reflected, in particular, in the low unemployment rate.",
        "It was pointed out that in recent months the annual nominal wage growth in the enterprise sector remained elevated.",
        "Alongside that, it was observed that increase in the minimum wage, as well as salary increases for public sector employees in 2024 would contribute to a higher wage growth in the economy.",
        "It was also noted that although the number of working persons remained high, the annual employment growth in the enterprise sector in November 2023 was again slightly negative.",
        "At the same time, the number of job vacancies in the economy at the end of 2023 Q3 was markedly smaller than a year before.",
        "According to the majority of the Council members, the effects of the previous NBP monetary policy tightening were still observed in the credit market.",
        "The ratio of bank credit to the non-financial private sector to GDP was 15 percentage points lower than before the pandemic.",
        "Some members of the Council pointed out that the annual growth in household and corporate loans remained negative.",
        "Yet, it was emphasized that from month to month banks granted more and more loans to households, including especially mortgages.",
        "This was significantly supported by the so-called “2% Safe Mortgage” programme.",
        "The Council Members noted that although the statutory limit of subsidies under this programme had been exhausted, new solutions had been announced, which – if put in place – might continue to contribute to a rise in housing loans.",
        "Certain Council members also paid attention to the fact that the annual growth in housing loans denominated in PLN, as well as consumer loans, was positive.",
        "At the meeting it was pointed out that – according to the data available at that time, i.e.",
        "the Statistics Poland flash estimate – the annual inflation rate declined to 6.1% in December 2023.",
        "It was noted that these data were lower than the market expectations.",
        "It was emphasised that the annual price growth in December was almost three times lower than the peak seen in February 2023.",
        "It was observed that when taking into account the Statistics Poland data, it might be estimated that in December core inflation fell for the ninth consecutive month.",
        "Certain Council members underlined that core inflation remained elevated, although its decline in the past quarters was faster than previously forecasted.",
        "The majority of the Council members assessed that the decline in inflation was driven not only by the reduced cost pressure or statistical effects but also by the low demand pressure.",
        "Those members pointed out that at present it was relatively difficult for enterprises to raise prices, especially as consumers’ inflation expectations had fallen sharply in recent quarters.",
        "On the other hand, certain Council members expressed the opinion that entrepreneurs’ expectations regarding price increases – as well as inflation forecasts formulated by financial sector analysts for 2025 – continued to be elevated.",
        "Certain Council members judged that amid the fading of external shocks boosting price growth, domestic factors started to play a more important role in inflation developments in Poland.",
        "At the same time, the Council members judged that the decrease in inflation was being supported by the appreciation of the zloty exchange rate, which was consistent with the fundamentals of the Polish economy.",
        "While discussing the short-term outlook for inflation in Poland, it was pointed out that a further decline in price growth was expected in the coming months.",
        "It was also emphasised that in 2024 Q1 inflation would probably be lower than predicted in the NBP’s November projection.",
        "It was judged, that according to the current forecasts, the annual price growth might decline below 3% in March 2024, i.e.",
        "to the level consistent with the NBP inflation target of 2.5% +/-1 percentage point.",
        "While discussing the longer-term outlook for inflation, the Council members underlined that inflation developments in the subsequent quarters were subject to high uncertainty.",
        "In this context, it was pointed out that in accordance with the draft Budget Act, zero VAT rate on food products was supposed to be in place until the end of March 2024.",
        "Alongside that, according to the current legal status, prices of gas, electricity and district heating for households were to remain frozen until the end of June 2024.",
        "It was emphasized that should higher VAT rate on food products be restored and energy prices raised, inflation might rise significantly in the second half of 2024.",
        "At the same time, it was noted, that uncertainty about the pace of economic recovery in Poland and its impact on inflationary pressures persisted.",
        "It was also pointed out that in particular higher wages in the public sector together with rising childcare benefits as well as old-age and disability pensions would increase household income, thus contributing to higher consumption, and, consequently, higher price growth.",
        "Some Council members also drew attention to the uncertainty about external factors affecting inflation, including those related to the future global economic conditions and commodity prices developments.",
        "The Council members expressed an opinion that given the above mentioned factors which were likely to affect CPI inflation in 2024, core inflation developments were of significant importance for the assessment of domestic inflation processes.",
        "The majority of the Council members assessed that despite the observed economic recovery, demand and cost pressures in the Polish economy remained low, which amidst the weakened economic conditions and falling inflation pressure abroad would support lower price growth in Poland.",
        "In the first months of 2024, the annual CPI growth is likely to fall significantly, while the decline in core inflation will be slower.",
        "However, inflation developments in subsequent quarters are associated with high uncertainty, related in particular to the impact of fiscal and regulatory policies on price developments, as well as the pace of economic recovery in Poland.",
        "It was emphasized that should higher VAT rate on food products be restored and energy prices raised, inflation might rise significantly in the second half of 2024.",
        "At the same time, increases in salaries for public sector employees and social benefits would contribute to higher inflation.",
        "Under these circumstances, the Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged.",
        "The Council judged that the current level of the NBP interest rates was conducive to meeting the NBP inflation target in the medium term.",
        "Certain Council members expressed the opinion that given the persistently high annual price growth and elevated inflation expectations, as well as amid the expected further recovery in demand and the fiscal measures launched, the level of the NBP interest rates was too low to ensure the return of inflation to the target in the medium term and to lower inflation expectations to levels consistent with the medium-term inflation target.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 5.75%, the lombard rate at 6.25%, the deposit rate at 5.25%, the rediscount rate at 5.80%, and the discount rate at 5.85%.",
        "The Council members pointed out that further decisions of the Council would depend on incoming information regarding the prospects for inflation and economic activity.",
        "During the discussion at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council it was noted that economic conditions in the euro area remained weakened, although some of the indicators signalled that the coming quarters might see a slow recovery in activity.",
        "At the same time, incoming data suggested that GDP in Germany might decline again in 2024 Q1 and was forecast to grow only slightly over 2024.",
        "It was judged that the weakened economic conditions in Germany, Poland’s main trading partner, would continue to have an adverse impact on Polish exports growth.",
        "When discussing inflation developments abroad, the Council members noted that following the earlier sharp fall, annual price growth in the United States and the euro area was running above the inflation targets of the central banks of these economies.",
        "At the same time, core inflation in these economies remained higher than headline inflation, although it was also slowly declining.",
        "It was pointed out that the fall in core inflation in the environment of the Polish economy was being slowed down by the persistence of elevated growth in service prices in view of the relatively robust growth in nominal wages.",
        "Under these circumstances, the central banks of the advanced economies were keeping interest rates unchanged.",
        "When discussing economic activity in Poland, the Council members judged that an economic recovery was under way, although GDP growth remained relatively low.",
        "According to the Statistics Poland preliminary estimate, annual GDP growth increased to 1% in 2023 Q4.",
        "GDP growth was positively affected by the contribution of net exports and investment.",
        "At the same time, consumption growth declined.",
        "Incoming data on the economic conditions at the beginning of 2024 indicate that in January both retail sales and industrial output grew.",
        "In the opinion of the Council members, these data signal a pickup in activity growth, including a recovery in consumption.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that annual construction and assembly production growth was negative in January 2024.",
        "When referring to the labour market conditions, it was noted that – in line with predictions – in January 2024 wage growth in the enterprise sector had picked up, largely a result of the increase in the minimum wage.",
        "It was underlined that the significant fall in inflation and higher nominal wage growth had translated into a marked real wage growth.",
        "On the other hand, annual employment growth in this sector was still negative.",
        "At the same time, the registered unemployment rate remained close to the historical lows.",
        "According to the majority of the Council members, the effects of NBP earlier monetary policy tightening could still be seen in the credit market.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that the previous months had seen clear signs of a recovery in lending, including in particular mortgages to households, which was attributable to the so-called “Safe Mortgage” programme.",
        "As regards mortgages, some Council members noted the uncertainty related to the possible reintroduction of the so-called repayment holidays.",
        "When discussing the outlook for economic activity, the Council members noted that according to the March projection, GDP growth would pick up and exceed 3% in 2024 (compared to 0.2% growth in 2023).",
        "It was emphasised that, according to the projection, following a marked fall last year, domestic demand would grow significantly in 2024.",
        "The results of the projection point, in particular, to a robust recovery of consumption, supported by high wage growth, including significant wage rises in the public sector and growth in the minimum wage, as well as by higher social benefits.",
        "Continued growth in investment is also forecast.",
        "It was pointed out that GDP forecasts were subject to uncertainty related to external factors, including the geopolitical situation and economic conditions in Europe, as well as domestic fiscal policy and the developments in food and energy prices.",
        "The Council members also pointed to persisting uncertainty regarding the degree to which higher household income would translate into growth in consumer spending, and to which it would result in growth in savings.",
        "Certain Council members pointed out that according to the March projection, GDP growth might be somewhat higher in 2024-2025 than that indicated in the November projection.",
        "At the meeting it was noted that according to Statistics Poland preliminary data, annual consumer price growth declined significantly in January 2024 and was lower than the median of the forecasts of market analysts.",
        "It was pointed out that in less than a year since reaching its peak, CPI inflation had fallen by over 14 percentage points.",
        "It was estimated that core inflation had also declined markedly, although it remained higher than headline CPI inflation and like in many other economies, it was declining more slowly.",
        "At the same time, in January 2024 the fall in producer prices had deepened, confirming the fading of the majority of external supply shocks and reduced cost pressure.",
        "Along with the relatively low economic activity growth, this had been contributing to a fall in inflation.",
        "It was judged that the decline in inflation was being supported by the appreciation of the zloty exchange rate, which was consistent with the fundamentals of the Polish economy.",
        "Certain Council members pointed out that the effect of high statistical base from the previous year had contributed to a fall in the annual inflation rate in January 2024.",
        "They also judged that – despite its decline – core inflation remained high.",
        "The Council members judged that in February 2024 inflation had likely declined again and had returned to a level consistent with the NBP inflation target of 2.5% +/-1 percentage point.",
        "It was noted that according to available forecasts, CPI inflation would probably also fall in March 2024.",
        "When discussing the inflation outlook, it was underlined that according to the March projection, price growth might rise again in the coming quarters.",
        "However, high uncertainty persisted about the scale of this rise, which was particularly due to the future form of the fiscal and regulatory measures impacting on food and energy prices in the CPI basket.",
        "It was noted that in the scenario assuming no increase in the VAT rate on food and unchanged energy prices until the end of 2024, inflation – according to the March projection – would grow slightly in the coming quarters and would run close to the upper band for deviations from the NBP inflation target.",
        "However, should the VAT rate on food products be restored from zero to 5% and should subsidies to energy prices be fully or partially removed, in the second half of 2024 inflation would rise significantly, exceeding the inflation target.",
        "Certain Council members expressed the opinion that the impact of the shielding measures on food and energy prices on the medium-term inflation outlook was limited.",
        "During the discussion it was pointed out that in the recent period inflation had fallen below the level of the NBP reference rate.",
        "The marked fall in inflation amid unchanged NBP interest rates had an upward effect on real interest rates ex post, which should be a factor curbing core inflation in the coming quarters.",
        "The Council members underlined that the medium-term inflation outlook, which was also subject to uncertainty, was of significant importance for monetary policy.",
        "The majority of Council members drew attention to the fact that according to the March projection – prepared with the assumption of unchanged NBP interest rates – from the second half of 2025, and also in 2026, i.e.",
        "over the monetary policy horizon, CPI inflation should be consistent with the NBP inflation target.",
        "Alongside that, the Council members noted that average annual core inflation – which in accordance with the projection should continue to gradually decline – would remain higher than headline CPI inflation over the projection horizon.",
        "It was also noted that according to the March projection, in 2025 core inflation would be higher than that forecast in November, which was largely due to the greater than expected scale of wage rises in the public sector in 2024.",
        "It was also pointed out that in recent quarters inflation, including core inflation, had fallen somewhat faster than indicated in earlier forecasts.",
        "Some Council members underlined that wage growth represented a risk for the outlook of core inflation, including service prices.",
        "In the opinion of certain Council members, elevated wage growth over the projection horizon might hamper a sustainable return of CPI inflation to the target.",
        "At the same time, in the opinion of certain Council members, the likelihood of inflation running at a level consistent with the NBP inflation target at the end of the projection horizon was too low.",
        "It was judged that demand pressure, and thus core inflation in the coming years, might be additionally boosted by the implementation of other proposed fiscal measures, including the increase in the amount of social benefits or introduction of new ones, as well as the possible increase in the tax-free allowance, although it is currently unclear whether and to what extent these measures will be implemented.",
        "The Council members also drew attention to other risk factors for inflation, including those related to the geopolitical situation, which might be of significance for commodity prices and the functioning of international trade.",
        "The majority of the Council members assessed that despite the observed economic recovery, demand and cost pressures in the Polish economy remained low, which amidst weakened economic conditions and falling inflation pressure abroad supported lower domestic inflation.",
        "As a result, annual CPI growth is expected to run at the level consistent with the NBP inflation target in the coming months, while core inflation will remain above CPI inflation.",
        "However, inflation developments in subsequent quarters are subject to substantial uncertainty related, in particular, to the impact of fiscal and regulatory policies on price developments, as well as to the pace of economic recovery in Poland and labour market conditions.",
        "It was emphasized that should the higher VAT rate on food products be restored and energy prices raised, inflation might rise significantly in the second half of 2024.",
        "Alongside that, over the medium term demand pressure in the economy will be stimulated by wage growth stemming i.a.",
        "from wage increases in the public sector.",
        "Against this background, the Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged.",
        "The Council judged that the current level of the NBP interest rates was conducive to meeting the NBP inflation target in the medium term.",
        "Certain Council members expressed the opinion that given the elevated core inflation, as well as amid the expected further recovery in demand and high wage growth, the level of the NBP interest rates was too low to ensure the sustainable return of inflation to the target in the medium term.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 5.75%, the lombard rate at 6.25%, the deposit rate at 5.25%, the rediscount rate at 5.80%, and the discount rate at 5.85%.",
        "The Council members pointed out that further decisions of the Council would depend on incoming information regarding prospects for inflation and economic activity."

    "2023": [
        "At the meeting, it was noted that global economic conditions deteriorated in recent months.",
        "Incoming data signalled, in particular, that in 2022 Q4 economic activity in the euro area, Poland’s major trading partner, might have slowed down.",
        "Some members of the Council pointed out that prospects for economic activity in the euro area, including Germany, also for 2023 were unfavourable and GDP growth might be close to zero.",
        "Slowdown in global economic growth was largely the effect of high energy prices, elevated uncertainty and global monetary policy tightening.",
        "This was accompanied by uncertainty related, among others, to consequences of China’s moving away from pandemic restrictions.",
        "The Council members pointed out that in recent months inflation in many economies started to decline.",
        "This was reflected, in particular, in the latest data on HICP inflation for some of euro area economies.",
        "Yet, it was emphasised that global inflation remained high.",
        "Some Council members highlighted high core inflation in most countries.",
        "The Council members stressed that the decline in inflation would be supported by the fall in the prices of some commodities, including prices of gas in Europe and prices of oil and agricultural commodities in the global markets, as well as the gradual easing of supply chain disruptions and a decline in freight prices.",
        "It was pointed out that many central banks were continuing to tighten their monetary policy.",
        "This concerned, in particular, the Federal Reserve of the United States and the European Central Bank which raised interest rates for another time, although to a lesser extent than before.",
        "At the same time, it was indicated that these banks started their interest rate hikes much later than NBP.",
        "Certain Council members also highlighted that the effects of monetary policy tightening in the United States and the euro area would only materialise in the coming quarters.",
        "Other Council members, in turn, pointed out that communication of major central banks suggested further monetary policy tightening, which – given high levels of core inflation and elevated nominal wage growth – may reflect their concerns about more persistent inflation.",
        "Alongside that, it was noted that following previous large interest rate hikes, most central banks in non-euro area countries of Central and Eastern Europe had recently kept interest rates unchanged.",
        "While analysing the situation in the Polish economy, the Council members indicated that in 2022 Q4 economic conditions continued to deteriorate.",
        "It was pointed out that although retail sales rose faster in November than in October, its pace was still sluggish.",
        "Industrial production growth in November was the weakest in many quarters.",
        "In turn, growth in construction and assembly output in November was close to the October figure, whereas some Council members emphasised that growing costs of financing were strongly undermining the outlook for the construction sector as indicated by, among others, the declining number of home construction starts.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that in December 2022 selected economic indicators rose somewhat, yet remained low.",
        "In effect, it was judged that the annual GDP growth in 2022 Q4 slowed down markedly for another consecutive quarter.",
        "It was also underlined that the coming quarters would probably see a further decline in GDP growth, which would include low growth in both consumption and investment.",
        "In the opinion of the Council members, the situation in the labour market remained good, which was reflected, in particular, in the low unemployment rate and a relatively strong rise in nominal wages.",
        "However, it was pointed out that growth in nominal wages was lower than inflation, which led to a decline in real wages and had a negative impact on growth in consumption demand.",
        "Some Council members also noted the fall in the LFS employment in 2022 Q3 as well as the results of Statistics Poland studies and NBP surveys signalling weakening of labour demand in the Polish economy, although situation differed across sectors.",
        "At the meeting, it was pointed out that the annual CPI in Poland in November 2022 declined to 17.5%.",
        "It was indicated that the fall in the annual CPI inflation was mainly driven by declining growth in the energy prices, including declining prices of heating fuels and fuels for private means of transport, as well as the base effects.",
        "Alongside that, core inflation net of food and energy prices rose to 11.4% in November 2022, which was largely the result of delayed effects of the rise in prices of energy, commodities, materials and intermediate goods.",
        "The persisting strong cost pressure also contributed to a slight rise in the annual growth of food prices.",
        "The Council members assessed that December 2022 might be expected to see a further fall in CPI inflation.",
        "It was pointed out that November 2022 saw another decline in PPI inflation, which might evidence the lessening of cost pressure in the economy.",
        "It was also emphasised that in December inflation expectations of both households and businesses declined.",
        "When discussing the outlook for inflation in Poland, the Council members indicated that inflation would probably increase in the early months of 2023, due to the withdrawal of some of the reduced tax rates introduced under the so-called Anti-inflationary Shield and the impact of the previous energy price rises.",
        "At the same time, the majority of the Council members underlined that in light of available forecasts and assuming no further shocks, inflation should gradually decline from 2023 Q2, converging towards the medium-term NBP target (2.5% +/- 1 percentage point).",
        "In the opinion of these Council members, the disinflation process would be supported by the hitherto significant monetary policy tightening by NBP, whose full macroeconomic effects would be increasingly visible, as well as the tightening of the global financing conditions, which acts towards slower global economic activity and lower commodity prices.",
        "Some Council members additionally observed that incoming data hinted at the possibility of inflation running somewhat below the path of the November projection in the coming quarters.",
        "In turn, certain Council members emphasised that in line with current forecasts, the average annual inflation in 2023 would be only slightly lower than in 2022, while the average annual core inflation would be higher in 2023 than in the previous year.",
        "During the meeting, it was pointed out that the strong monetary policy tightening conducted by NBP so far had an impact on monetary conditions in the Polish economy.",
        "In this context it was observed that lending to households had slowed down, which was particularly visible in a decline in debt arising from housing and consumer loans.",
        "Some Council members underlined that the NBP interest rate hikes had also been reflected in substantially higher rates on loans in recent quarters, including on corporate loans, and a change in the dynamics and structure of monetary aggregates, including in a rise in term deposits and a decline in cash.",
        "The majority of the Council members assessed that the expected weakening of the external economic conditions, together with monetary policy tightening by major central banks, would curb global inflation and commodity prices.",
        "The weakening of the global economic conditions would also hamper GDP growth in Poland.",
        "Under such circumstances, the hitherto significant monetary policy tightening by NBP would support a decline in inflation in Poland towards the NBP inflation target.",
        "At the same time, given the strength and persistence of the shocks that remain beyond the impact of domestic monetary policy, in the short term inflation would remain high, and its return to the NBP inflation target would be gradual.",
        "Alongside that, it was underlined that the Council flexibly determined the desirable time necessary to bring inflation back to the target, as bringing inflation rapidly back to the target might entail significant costs to macroeconomic and financial stability.",
        "The decrease in inflation would be faster if supported by an appreciation of the zloty exchange rate, which, in the Council’s assessment, would be consistent with the fundamentals of the Polish economy.",
        "In the opinion of the Council, considering the expected scenario of the gradual return of inflation to the NBP inflation target in the coming years, amid the deterioration in domestic economic conditions, including in the labour market, and the incoming signals of the global inflationary pressure slowing down, it was justified to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged.",
        "Certain Council members expressed the opinion that given the persistently high price growth and elevated inflation expectations, the hitherto scale of interest rate hikes by NBP was insufficient to ensure the return of inflation to the target in the medium term and to lower inflation expectations to levels consistent with the medium-term inflation target.",
        "In the opinion of those Council members, the disinflation process as foreseen by the forecasts, and particularly the decline in core inflation, would be too slow.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 6.75%, the lombard rate at 7.25%, the deposit rate at 6.25%, the rediscount rate at 6.80%, and the discount rate at 6.85%.",
        "The Council members pointed out that further decisions of the Council would depend on incoming information regarding the perspectives for inflation and economic activity, including the impact of the Russian military aggression against Ukraine on the Polish economy.",
        "At the meeting it was pointed out that global economic activity growth remained subdued.",
        "It was also observed that in the euro area – despite a certain improvement in recent months – economic conditions remained weak.",
        "The Council members pointed out that in the recent period global negative supply shocks had gradually eased.",
        "It was emphasized that in recent months prices of energy commodities had fallen, although they remained considerably higher than before the pandemic.",
        "At the same time, disruptions in global value chains were easing.",
        "It was pointed out that the fading of these shocks was supporting global economic activity and reducing inflationary pressures.",
        "Nevertheless, according to available forecasts, in 2023 GDP growth in major economies would be relatively weak.",
        "At the same time, attention was drawn to the uncertainty about the global macroeconomic outlook due, among others, to the consequences of China’s departure from the restrictive epidemic policy.",
        "It was pointed out that in the recent period CPI and HICP inflation had declined in the United States and in the euro area, respectively, whereas in certain Central and Eastern European countries consumer price growth had picked up.",
        "Global inflation is forecast to fall due to the easing of the negative supply shocks and a slowdown in consumption growth observed in many countries.",
        "It was also emphasised that according to forecasts, inflation would decline gradually, especially core inflation, which remained high and in many countries had not yet started to fall.",
        "Certain Council members also drew attention to the uncertainty about the pace of disinflationary processes in the euro area and future developments of service prices in the United States.",
        "At the meeting it was pointed out that the Federal Reserve of the United States and the European Central Bank continued to increase their interest rates, while certain Council members pointed out that representatives of those central banks were indicating that it was necessary to bring inflation down relatively fast.",
        "Other Council members underlined, however, that these banks had launched interest rate hikes much later than NBP, and that the total scale of the monetary policy tightening so far in the United States and the euro area was significantly smaller than in Poland.",
        "At the same time, it was indicated that central banks in Central and Eastern Europe – following the earlier strong monetary policy tightening – were now keeping interest rates unchanged.",
        "It was observed that amid weaker economic conditions and the forecast decline in inflation, an increasing number of central banks were putting monetary policy tightening on hold.",
        "While analysing the situation in Poland, the Council members pointed out that – amid the weakening of economic growth around the world – activity in Poland had also slowed down.",
        "In 2022 Q4, real GDP growth declined to 2.0% y/y.",
        "Economic growth was lowered by reduced consumption demand.",
        "At the same time, investment activity continued to increase.",
        "In this context the majority of the Council members judged that the observed structure of GDP growth should support the disinflationary processes.",
        "It was pointed out that the available data for January 2023 – including data on industrial output and retail sales – corroborated the weakening of economic conditions.",
        "While discussing the outlook for economic activity, Council members pointed out that according to the March projection in 2023 GDP growth would be low amid weaker consumption.",
        "It was observed that economic activity would continue to be curbed by the consequences of the earlier negative supply shocks, slowdown in the global economy and the monetary policy tightening implemented so far.",
        "In line with this projection, in the years 2024-2025 economic growth would pick up, however, it was observed that this would be a gradual process.",
        "It was emphasised that throughout the entire projection horizon the output gap would be negative.",
        "Attention was also drawn to the uncertainty about the forecast growth in economic activity.",
        "In this context some members of the Council pointed to a higher likelihood of GDP growth running below the central path of the projection, although certain Council members stressed that higher economic growth was possible.",
        "The Council members pointed out that the robust labour market situation continued, although employment growth in the enterprise sector had slowed down slightly.",
        "According to the LFS data, the number of working persons in the economy in 2022 Q4 remained close to the level recorded a year before, while it declined in the private sector.",
        "It was pointed out that the annual growth in average nominal wages in the enterprise sector had increased in January 2023.",
        "Certain Council members pointed out that the rise in nominal wages exceeded labour productivity growth.",
        "At the meeting it was assessed that labour market adjustment to the weakened economic conditions occurred through real wages rather than rising unemployment which was a favourable scenario from the point of view of macroeconomic stability and long-term growth.",
        "At the meeting it was pointed out that according to the Statistics Poland preliminary data – not taking into account the annual change in the weights in the basket of consumer goods and services – annual CPI inflation in January 2023 had increased compared to December 2022 due to a rise in VAT rates on energy products and the adjustment of some prices of energy carriers.",
        "It was pointed out that core inflation might also have increased slightly, yet this was judged not to be an effect of accelerating demand as demand growth was on the decline.",
        "By contrast, annual food price growth had declined again.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that in the recent period inflation expectations of consumers and businesses had fallen considerably, although certain Council members indicated that the structure of responses to the survey questions had improved only recently.",
        "While discussing the outlook for inflation in Poland, it was pointed out that according to the available forecasts, February 2023 probably saw the peak of CPI inflation.",
        "According to the March projection and other forecasts, in 2023 Q2 price growth would start to systematically decline.",
        "It was emphasised that the decline in inflation would be driven not only by the statistical base effect, but also by weakening price pressures.",
        "It was also observed that, on the one hand, demand was weakening, limiting the room for price increases, and, on the other hand, the growth in costs was slowing down, which was reflected, among others, in falling PPI inflation.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that the effects of the earlier shocks would fade away gradually, given the nature and the scale of these shocks.",
        "According to the projection, CPI inflation in Poland will continue to decline also in the coming years.",
        "Certain Council members stressed that the projection was prepared under the assumption of unchanged NBP interest rates.",
        "The majority of the Council members underlined that at the end of the projection horizon price dynamics should be consistent with the NBP inflation target.",
        "It was also observed that core inflation would decrease in the projection horizon.",
        "Certain Council members pointed out, however, that from mid 2023 core inflation would account for most of the overall inflation.",
        "Some Council members pointed to the uncertainty about the outlook for inflation, with certain Council member highlighting the possibility of price growth running above the central path of the projection, while others were flagging the possibility of a faster decline in inflation.",
        "During the meeting the impact of NBP’s strong monetary policy tightening on monetary conditions was highlighted.",
        "It was pointed out that growth in monetary and credit aggregates had slowed down considerably, including a decline in households lending stock.",
        "Certain Council members pointed out that the value of newly granted loans was significant in their view.",
        "At the same time, some Council members remarked that the easing of the supervisory recommendations regarding credit underwriting criteria for certain types of loans might contribute to a slight rebound in lending.",
        "The majority of the Council members assessed, that the weakening of the external economic conditions, together with a decline in commodity prices, would continue to curb global inflation, which would contribute to lower price growth in Poland.",
        "Decline in domestic inflation would be supported by the weakening in GDP growth, including consumption, amid significant decrease in credit growth.",
        "As a result, the majority of the Council members assessed that the earlier strong monetary policy tightening undertaken by NBP would lead to a decline in inflation in Poland towards the NBP inflation target.",
        "At the same time, given strength and persistence of the recent shocks that remain beyond the impact of domestic monetary policy, the return of inflation to the NBP inflation target would be gradual.",
        "Such an assessment was supported by the March projection of inflation and GDP.",
        "Alongside that, it was underlined that the Council flexibly determined the desirable time necessary to bring inflation back to the target, as bringing inflation rapidly back to the target might entail significant costs to macroeconomic and financial stability.",
        "The decrease in inflation would be faster if supported by appreciation of the zloty exchange rate, which, in the Council’s assessment, would be consistent with the fundamentals of the Polish economy.",

        "The Council members pointed out that further decisions of the Council would depend on incoming information regarding prospects for inflation and economic activity.",
        "At the meeting, it was noted that the economic conditions in the external environment of the Polish economy remained weakened, although it varied across countries.",
        "It was pointed out that the economic situation in the United States was still favourable, yet – after the rapid GDP growth in 2023 Q3 – activity growth might have slowed down.",
        "On the other hand, stagnation tendencies continued in the euro area.",
        "Annual GDP growth in Germany, Poland’s main trading partner, was negative in 2023 Q3.",
        "Forecasts suggest that in 2024 GDP in Germany will return to the upward trend; however, uncertainty persists as to the materialisation of this scenario.",
        "The uncertainty is related to the structural problems of the German economy, the previous monetary policy tightening by the ECB and the likely fiscal tightening.",
        "The Council members underlined that annual price growth in the external environment of the Polish economy was declining further, although in many countries it remained elevated.",
        "In the euro area, inflation – including core inflation – declined by more than expected.",
        "Price growth in the countries of the Central and Eastern Europe region was also slowing down, yet it remained higher than in advanced economies.",
        "It was observed that amid the falling inflation, most central banks in advanced economies had recently kept interest rates unchanged after prior increases.",
        "It was pointed out that market expectations indicated a possibility of interest rate cuts in the major economies in 2024, although it was also stressed that those expectations were subject to uncertainty.",
        "At the meeting it was observed that amid the weakened global economic conditions, also in Poland activity growth remained low, although it rose recently.",
        "According to the Statistics Poland preliminary estimate, GDP growth in Poland stood at 0.5% y/y in 2023 Q3 compared to -0.6% y/y in the previous quarter.",
        "GDP growth was positively affected by the contribution of net exports, and, albeit to a lesser extent, an increase in investment and consumption.",
        "Some Council members emphasised that consumption growth had been higher than expected.",
        "At the same time, the Council members stated that the contribution of changes in inventories to GDP growth was markedly negative in 2023 Q3.",
        "While discussing the outlook for the economic activity, it was pointed out that GDP growth would probably be accelerating in the coming quarters.",
        "This would be driven by an increase in consumption on the back of real wage growth.",
        "The majority of the Council members emphasised that despite the expected higher GDP growth, the output gap in the following quarters would, according the NBP’s November projection, remain negative.",
        "Certain Council members observed that also the rise in the nominal value of household assets observed in recent years might have an upward effect on consumption.",
        "During the discussion it was stated that the latest monthly data were consistent with the scenario of accelerating economic growth as outlined in the November NBP’s projection.",
        "In October, retail sales as well as industrial output and construction and assembly production were higher than the year before.",
        "At the same time, it was underlined that consumer confidence was improving.",
        "The PMI Manufacturing index had also risen, although it continued to indicate an ongoing downturn in industry.",
        "While analysing the labour market situation, the Council members noted that it remained good, as reflected in particular in the low unemployment rate.",
        "Although the number of working persons remained high, employment in the enterprise sector was lower than at the beginning of the year.",
        "Certain Council members pointed out that despite the increase in the number of foreign workers in the Polish labour market, demographic changes might be one of the factors hampering employment growth.",
        "Alongside that, as inflation decreased, the annual real wage growth in the national economy increased in 2023 Q3, and, like in Q2 of that year, was positive.",
        "The majority of the Council members judged that despite the observed increase in real wages, the overall cost pressure among enterprises was easing.",
        "In contrast, certain Council members drew attention to the fact that real wages were rising faster than labour productivity, and – according to surveys – the measures of wage pressure, despite falling, remained above the long-term average.",
        "According to the majority of the Council members, the effects of the previous NBP monetary policy tightening were still observed in the credit market.",
        "The ratio of bank credit to the non-financial private sector to GDP was approximately 15 percentage points lower than before the pandemic.",
        "Annual growth in credit to both households and corporates remained negative.",
        "However, the Council members pointed out that increasingly visible signs of recovery could be observed in the credit market.",
        "It was indicated that banks were granting more and more housing loans, which was supported in particular by the so-called “2% Safe Mortgage” programme.",
        "At the meeting, it was pointed out that – according to the data available at that time, i.e.",
        "the Statistics Poland flash estimate – the annual inflation rate was running at 6.5% in November.",
        "The Council members pointed out that, as previously expected, the disinflation process was slower than in previous months, although given the available Statistics Poland data, the decrease in core inflation in November could be estimated as greater than in October.",
        "The majority of the Council members argued that price growth was curbed by the weakened demand pressures and the decline in cost pressures.",
        "The diminishing cost pressures and the fading of most external supply shocks were also indicated by the increasingly sharper declines in the PPI index.",
        "At the same time, the Council members judged that the decrease in inflation was being supported by the appreciation of the zloty exchange rate, which was consistent with the fundamentals of the Polish economy.",
        "Some Council members observed that in recent months, the indicators of inflation expectations had decreased.",
        "Yet certain Council members drew attention to the slight deterioration in the structure of the responses in the surveys of inflation expectations.",
        "While discussing the outlook for inflation in Poland, the majority of the Council members pointed out that a further decline in price growth was expected.",
        "It was also emphasised that inflation developments, both in the short- and medium-term, were associated with uncertainty, related in particular to the pace of economic recovery in Poland and its impact on price developments as well as future course of fiscal and regulatory policies.",
        "In particular, it was pointed out that despite the incoming announcements concerning the shape of fiscal policy, uncertainty persisted as to future VAT rates on food products, energy price regulations as well as other elements of fiscal policy.",
        "It was underlined that fiscal and regulatory measures might affect future inflation developments, both directly and through their impact on the economic conditions and demand in the economy.",
        "The majority of the Council members assessed that the incoming data indicated low demand and cost pressures in the Polish economy, which amidst the weakened economic conditions and falling inflation pressure abroad would support a gradual decline in domestic inflation.",
        "Considering the adjustment in the NBP interest rates introduced in previous months, together with uncertainty about a future course of fiscal and regulatory policies and their impact on inflation, the Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged.",
        "The Council judged that the current level of the NBP interest rates was conducive to meeting the NBP inflation target in the medium term.",
        "It was emphasised that the Council flexibly determined the desirable time necessary to bring inflation back to the target, as bringing inflation rapidly back to the target might entail significant costs to macroeconomic and financial stability.",
        "The view was expressed that given the persistently high annual price growth and elevated inflation expectations, the level of the NBP interest rates was too low to ensure the return of inflation to the target in the medium term and to lower inflation expectations to levels consistent with the medium-term inflation target.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 5.75%, the lombard rate at 6.25%, the deposit rate at 5.25%, the rediscount rate at 5.80%, and the discount rate at 5.85%.",
        "The Council members pointed out that further decisions of the Council would depend on incoming information regarding the prospects for inflation and economic activity.",
        "At the meeting, it was noted that the economic conditions in Poland’s largest trading partners remained weakened.",
        "At the same time, uncertainty about the activity outlook persisted in the external environment of the Polish economy.",
        "In 2023 Q3, annual GDP growth in the euro area had slowed down to 0.1%, and in Germany economic activity had declined.",
        "Available forecasts suggest that growth in the euro area would recover in 2024, albeit gradually.",
        "At the same time, the recovery would be fraught with uncertainty, among others, due to the effects of monetary policy tightening by the European Central Bank and also due to structural problems in some of the large euro area economies.",
        "In turn, in the United States the economic conditions remained favourable, and in 2023 Q3 activity growth had increased.",
        "However, it was pointed out that some of the recently published data, including data on the labour market, signalled the risk of a slowdown in this economy.",
        "The Council members observed that the disinflation process was advancing across the world.",
        "According to the Eurostat flash estimate, inflation had fallen to 2.9% in the euro area in October.",
        "Core inflation had also declined, although it remained higher.",
        "In Central and Eastern Europe price growth had also fallen.",
        "It was pointed out that according to the forecasts of the major central banks, further disinflation would, however, proceed more slowly.",
        "As a result, the inflation target in the euro area should be met in the second half of 2025, and in the United States as late as 2026.",
        "It was underlined that the central banks in the euro area and in the United States had kept interest rates unchanged at their recent policy meetings.",
        "Certain Council members observed that both the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve of the United States were signalling that their monetary policy would remain restrictive for an extended period.",
        "At the meeting it was noted that the heightened geopolitical tensions in the Middle East were a risk factor for the global economy.",
        "These tensions were pushing up prices of some commodities, although the scale of the impact had, so far, been limited.",
        "Amid the weakened global economic conditions, also in Poland activity growth remained low, although some data signal its gradual recovery.",
        "The Council members pointed out that in September 2023 retail sales had declined in annual terms, but the scale of the fall had been smaller than in previous months.",
        "Industrial output had also declined in annual terms; however, in monthly terms and after seasonal adjustment it had risen.",
        "In turn, the growth in construction and assembly output had been the highest in more than a year.",
        "Moreover, a gradual improvement in consumer sentiment was highlighted.",
        "Taking into account monthly data, the Council members judged that GDP growth in 2023 Q3 had most likely been positive, although it had remained low.",
        "While analysing the labour market situation, the Council members noted that it remained good.",
        "Nevertheless, in September 2023 annual employment growth in the enterprise sector once again stood at zero.",
        "On the other hand, amid a marked fall in inflation, growth in real wages in this sector was positive.",
        "At the same time, nominal wage growth was gradually slowing down.",
        "Also survey results indicated that wage pressure was weakening somewhat.",
        "However, certain Council members drew attention to the fact that the percentage of firms planning wage increases remained above the long-term average.",
        "According to the majority of the Council members, the effects of the previous NBP monetary policy tightening were still observed in the credit market.",
        "The annual growth in lending to households continued to be negative, in particular, due to the decline in total volume of mortgage loans, despite some revival observed in this market segment.",
        "Whereas, consumer credit was rising, albeit at a relatively slow pace.",
        "While discussing the outlook for economic activity, the Council members pointed out that although in 2023 activity growth was low, in line with the NBP November projection the coming quarters would see GDP growth accelerate.",
        "It was also indicated that in 2023 GDP growth was to be lower than expected in July, while in the next two years it was to be somewhat faster.",
        "Yet, it was emphasised that output gap was expected to remain negative in the projection horizon, which would support the decline in inflation.",
        "At the meeting, it was pointed out that the annual CPI index had again fallen markedly in October 2023, running at 6.5% according to the Statistics Poland flash estimate.",
        "It was stressed that price growth had fallen in all the main components of the inflation basket, probably including also core inflation.",
        "It was assessed that this was the effect of the weakening of both demand and cost pressure, whose decline was reflected, in particular, in the negative annual PPI growth.",
        "While discussing the outlook for inflation in Poland, the majority of the Council members pointed out that in line with the November projection, inflation would decline in the coming quarters, albeit, as previously anticipated, the decline would be slower than to date.",
        "It was emphasised that the projection assumed that inflation would return to the NBP inflation target, i.e.",
        "2.5% ±1 percentage point, in 2025 Q4.",
        "Thus, it was assessed that the horizon of inflation returning to the target had not materially changed compared to the July projection, which resulted from the fact that lower NBP interest rates were offset with weaker demand pressure and lower inflation at the starting point of the projection.",
        "It was also indicated that the slightly higher inflation in 2025 assumed in the November projection compared to the July projection was the effect of higher food and energy prices amid unchanged average annual core inflation.",
        "Certain Council members pointed out that core inflation was to remain above the upper limit for deviations from the NBP inflation target until the end of the projection horizon.",
        "The Council members pointed out that inflation developments, both in the short- and medium-term, were fraught with uncertainty, including the uncertainty related to the future course of fiscal and regulatory policies.",
        "Special attention was drawn to the uncertainty about future VAT rates on food products and the uncertainty related to energy price regulations as well as other elements of fiscal policy in the coming years.",
        "The majority of the Council members assessed that the current interest rate level was supporting the decline in inflation.",
        "Those members argued that further decline in inflation, which contributes to lowering inflation expectations, increases real interest rates.",
        "On the other hand, certain Council members pointed to a slight rise in inflation expectations of enterprises in the recent period and a slight deterioration in the structure of responses in the survey of consumer inflation expectations.",
        "The majority of the Council members assessed that incoming data indicated low demand and cost pressures in the Polish economy, which amidst weakened economic conditions and falling inflation pressure abroad would support a gradual decline in domestic inflation.",
        "Considering the adjustment in the NBP interest rates introduced in recent months, together with uncertainty about a future course of fiscal and regulatory policies and their impact on inflation, the Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged.",
        "The Council judged that the current level of the NBP interest rates was conducive to meeting the NBP inflation target in the medium term.",
        "It was emphasised that the Council flexibly determined the desirable time necessary to bring inflation back to the target, as bringing inflation rapidly back to the target might entail significant costs to macroeconomic and financial stability.",
        "The Council members upheld the assessment that the decrease in inflation would be faster if supported by an appreciation of the zloty exchange rate, which, in the Council’s assessment, would be consistent with the fundamentals of the Polish economy.",
        "The view was expressed that given the persistently high annual price growth and elevated inflation expectations, the level of the NBP interest rates was too low to ensure the return of inflation to the target in the medium term and to lower inflation expectations to levels consistent with the medium-term inflation target.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 5.75%; the lombard rate at 6.25%; the deposit rate at 5.25%; the rediscount rate at 5.80%; the discount rate at 5.85%.",
        "The Council members pointed out that further decisions of the Council would depend on incoming information regarding the prospects for inflation and economic activity.",
        "At the meeting it was pointed out that the economic conditions in the environment of the Polish economy remained subdued.",
        "In the euro area activity growth had been constrained in recent quarters.",
        "It was emphasised that the euro area economy was expected to rebound in the coming quarters; however, the scale of the recovery would be rather modest, and in Germany, according to forecasts, GDP would fall in 2023.",
        "In the United States the current economic conditions remained better than in the euro area, although forecasts indicated their possible weakening.",
        "The Council members underlined that global inflation was declining, but continued to be elevated.",
        "CPI inflation in the United States had fallen to 4.0% in May, while HICP inflation in the euro area had fallen to 5.5% in June.",
        "In Central and Eastern European countries inflation had also declined.",
        "It was pointed out that in recent months core inflation had also begun to decline in many economies, although it remained elevated.",
        "Forecasts signalled a further fall in global inflation in the coming quarters.",
        "This was supposed to result from both the fading of the earlier supply shocks and the significant global monetary tightening and the related weakening of economic activity.",
        "The continuation of the disinflation process is indicated by the significant fall in cost and price pressure, including a sharp decline in PPI inflation.",
        "At the Council meeting it was pointed out that the central banks in the United States and the euro area forecasted that price growth would decline only gradually.",
        "As a result, inflation in these economies might still slightly exceed the inflation targets in 2025.",
        "It was underlined that the future pace of disinflation in the environment of the Polish economy would be determined in particular by the situation in the labour markets and enterprises’ price policy.",
        "In this context, attention was drawn to the significant role of growth in corporate mark-ups and profits in shaping prices in recent quarters.",
        "Amid subdued economic growth around the world, activity growth had also slowed down in Poland.",
        "The Council members stressed that May 2023 was the third month in a row in which retail sales had fallen sharply in annual terms.",
        "Consequently, it was pointed out that in 2023 Q2 the fall in household consumption had most likely deepened.",
        "Industrial as well as construction and assembly output had also declined in annual terms in May 2023.",
        "At the same time, it was highlighted that the situation in the labour market had not changed significantly.",
        "It was observed that employment continued to rise in the services sector, while industry saw a fall in employment.",
        "This was accompanied by steady wage growth in the enterprise sector.",
        "While discussing the economic activity outlook in Poland, the Council members indicated that in line with the NBP’s July projection, GDP growth would be low in 2023.",
        "It was underlined that consumption growth might be negative throughout the whole of 2023, which would support the disinflation process.",
        "Although according to the July projection the coming quarters were to see some recovery in activity – amid a rise in real wages and the fading of the negative supply shocks – GDP growth was expected to remain moderate and the output gap negative over the projection horizon.",
        "At the Council meeting it was underlined that – in line with earlier predictions – inflation declined significantly.",
        "According to the Statistics Poland flash estimate, CPI inflation fell to 11.5% y/y in June 2023.",
        "It was observed that in the last four months inflation had declined by about 7 percentage points, and that June was the second month in a row in which the overall consumer price level had remained unchanged from the previous month.",
        "Attention was drawn to a further drop in energy prices and a decline in food prices compared to the previous month.",
        "Therefore, the majority of the Council members argued that the still high annual inflation rate was not resulting from current growth in the overall price level, but was reflecting past price changes in previous periods.",
        "It was pointed out that based on available data, it could be estimated that in June price growth of all the main groups included in the basket of consumer goods and services had declined, and that in particular core inflation had probably fallen markedly.",
        "The Council members also observed that PPI inflation had fallen rapidly in recent quarters and producer price growth in the manufacturing sector had already been negative in May 2023.",
        "Certain Council members expressed the opinion that price-setting processes in Poland, like in other countries, were currently following a different pattern than in a low inflation period.",
        "In the view of these Council members, the decline in the annual CPI index mainly reflected the base effects and the fall in commodity prices, while inflation expectations – despite declining – continued to be high, and inflation both in Poland and aboard remained persistent.",
        "These Council members also underlined the improvement in the expected labour market situation envisaged in several previous NBP projections, which could support higher inflation.",
        "However, while discussing the outlook for inflation in Poland, the majority of the Council members pointed out that in line with the July projection, in the coming quarters inflation would keep declining and in the second half of 2025 it would reach a level consistent with the NBP inflation target.",
        "This would be supported by the fading of the earlier shocks in commodity markets and the global supply chain disruptions, strong monetary policy tightening undertaken by NBP and the slowdown in aggregate demand growth.",
        "In the opinion of these Council members, the currently observed strong fall in PPI inflation, the reduction in value of loans to the non-financial sector and the declining inflation expectations of consumers and enterprises would also contribute to a fall in CPI inflation.",
        "It was judged that the disinflation process was also supported by the marked appreciation of the zloty observed in recent months.",
        "Some Council members drew attention to the fact that relatively high wage growth could be a risk factor for the inflation outlook in Poland.",
        "However, the majority of the Council members judged that the weakening economic conditions would curb enterprises’ ability to raise prices further and that firms would be able to absorb rising costs, including labour costs, by reducing their margins, which had been high in the previous quarters.",
        "The majority of the Council members assessed that the weakening of the external economic conditions, together with lower commodity prices, would continue to curb global inflation, which would still contribute to lower price growth in Poland.",
        "The decline in domestic inflation would be supported by the weakening of domestic GDP growth, including the continued decline in consumption, amid a significant decrease in credit growth.",
        "The majority of the Council members assessed that the strong monetary policy tightening undertaken by NBP has been leading to a decline in inflation in Poland towards the NBP inflation target.",
        "At the same time, given the strength and persistence of the earlier shocks, which remained beyond the impact of domestic monetary policy, the return of inflation to the NBP inflation target would be gradual.",
        "Alongside that, it was underlined that the Council flexibly determined the desirable time necessary to bring inflation back to the target, as bringing inflation rapidly back to the target might entail significant costs to macroeconomic and financial stability.",
        "The Council members upheld the assessment that the decrease in inflation would be faster if supported by an appreciation of the zloty exchange rate, which, in the Council’s assessment, would be consistent with the fundamentals of the Polish economy.",
        "The majority of the Council members recognised that, taking into account the above conditions, and in particular the significant decline in inflation and its expected further gradual decline, as well as the weakening of the domestic economic conditions, including the consolidating fall in consumer demand, decline in inflation expectations, low growth in monetary and credit aggregates, and also the decline in inflationary pressure abroad combined with the risks to the global economic outlook, and taking into account the earlier strong monetary policy tightening, it was warranted to end the monetary policy tightening cycle.",
        "At the same time, certain Council members pointed out that the significant fall in inflation and declining inflation expectations amid unchanged interest rates were contributing to an increase in the restrictiveness of monetary policy.",
        "Under these circumstances, and also considering the prospect of a further fall in inflation and low economic activity growth, in the coming months it might be justified to consider lowering of the NBP interest rates.",
        "The view was expressed that given the persistently high annual price growth and elevated inflationary expectations, the current level of the NBP interest rates was too low to ensure the return of inflation to the target in the medium term and to lower inflation expectations to levels consistent with the medium-term inflation target.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 6.75%, the lombard rate at 7.25%, the deposit rate at 6.25%, the rediscount rate at 6.80%, and the discount rate at 6.85%.",
        "The Council pointed out that further decisions of the Council would depend on incoming information regarding prospects for inflation and economic activity.",
        "At the meeting, it was pointed out that global economic conditions remained subdued, as confirmed by GDP growth data for 2023 Q1 in the United States and the euro area.",
        "In particular, it was observed that economic growth in the euro area was only slightly positive.",
        "In contrast, economic activity had accelerated in China after the country’s departure from its previous zero-Covid policy.",
        "However, the Council drew attention to the fact that according to the forecasts by international institutions, global GDP growth would run below its long-term average in 2023 and was expected to remain moderate in 2024.",
        "At the same time, some Council members argued that while the energy shock was fading, turmoil in the US banking sector had become a risk factor to global economic conditions.",
        "The Council members indicated that concerns about global activity levels were reflected in the declining prices of many energy commodities, including oil – despite the decision of OPEC+ to reduce its output.",
        "Some Council members also observed that the prices of agricultural commodities had fallen in recent months, with certain council members judging that further developments in food prices were subject to considerable uncertainty.",
        "The Council members pointed out that in early May 2023, the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank raised interest rates by 25 bps.",
        "Certain Council members were of the opinion that the Fed and the ECB, while probably approaching the end of the monetary policy tightening cycle – in particular, due to the turmoil in the US banking sector – were concerned about the persistence of inflation.",
        "It was emphasised that global inflation was declining, but that the process was gradual, which was associated with the hitherto high level of core inflation in most countries, including the United States and many European economies.",
        "The high core inflation was judged to result from both the earlier sharp cost increases and from an increase in corporate margins, as, amid favourable labour market conditions and demand growth, some businesses had raised prices by more than was implied by the rising costs.",
        "The majority of the Council members expressed the opinion that, as the supply shocks receded and demand growth slowed down, core inflation might be expected to gradually decline.",
        "Certain Council members argued that price-setting processes, including the frequency and characteristics of price changes, were presently different than before the pandemic – i.e.",
        "during a period of low inflation – which might add to the persistence of inflation in many countries.",
        "In their view, a similar effect could materialise due to higher demand for services, entailing an increase in demand for workers in this sector, reflected in the steep growth of their wages and high services price inflation.",
        "These members observed, however, that it was not known how persistent these processes would prove to be.",
        "When referring to domestic economic conditions, some Council members judged that incoming data for 2023 Q1 confirmed a slowdown in GDP growth, including a marked fall in consumer demand.",
        "They observed, in particular, that the declines in retail sales and industrial output had deepened in March, and a further decrease in the manufacturing PMI in April suggested a weakening in the industrial sector.",
        "These members pointed out that construction and assembly output had also fallen in March.",
        "At the same time, the majority of the Council members were of the opinion that economic recovery could be expected in the second half of 2023.",
        "It was pointed out that the labour market situation continued to be good, yet some Council members emphasised that employment growth in the enterprise sector was gradually slowing down, and nominal wage growth had declined in March.",
        "Alongside that, certain Council members observed that employment in the service sector was mostly rising, and in its selected sections – as well as in manufacturing – nominal wage growth was still very high in their opinion.",
        "At the same time, the increase of the minimum wage since the beginning of 2023 had boosted household income.",
        "According to these Council members, the ratio of wages to labour productivity continued to be high, as did the share of businesses experiencing wage pressure, despite having fallen somewhat.",
        "At the meeting, it was pointed out that according to Statistics Poland preliminary data, annual CPI inflation had declined to 14.7% in April (from 16.1% in March and 18.4% in February), which was primarily due to the slower annual food price growth.",
        "The annual growth in energy prices also slowed down, yet again, and preliminary estimates suggested that core inflation (excluding food and energy prices) had decreased slightly in April as well.",
        "The Council members observed that disinflation was evident in industrial producer prices, whose growth had declined markedly in recent months.",
        "The majority of the Council members also highlighted the continued decline in households’ inflation expectations as well as firms’ declarations, according to which it was increasingly difficult for businesses to raise prices in response to the rising costs.",
        "According to these Council members, the above factors were behind a further expected decline in inflation, including core inflation.",
        "The majority of the Council members judged in this context that the disinflation process was supported by the recently observed appreciation of the zloty.",
        "Certain Council members were of the opinion that price-setting processes in Poland, like in other countries, were currently following a different pattern than in a low inflation period, and that these processes were affected by the rising role of the service sector, which increased the risk of inflation persistence.",
        "In the opinion of these Council members, the decline in the annual CPI index reflected the base effects, and the impact of the previous NBP interest rate hikes was not sufficient, particularly as a considerable share of businesses and consumers were still expecting high inflation.",
        "When assessing the inflation outlook, the majority of the Council members were of the opinion that consumer price growth would keep declining markedly, continuing the initiated process of disinflation.",
        "Alongside that, some Council members expressed the opinion that the decline in inflation might be somewhat slower than the path outlined in the March projection.",
        "In this context, these Council members drew attention to many persisting uncertainty factors.",
        "At the same time, the majority of the Council members judged that the prospect of inflation returning to the target over the projection horizon had not changed.",
        "However, certain Council members argued that, in their opinion, inflation would not fall to the level of the NBP inflation target by the end of 2025.",
        "Some Council members underlined that the high level of NBP interest rates – alongside the earlier price increases – was a factor limiting the propensity to spend.",
        "The effects of high interest rates could be seen, among others, in the marked decline in the M1 monetary aggregate and slower growth of credit debt, including the fall in stock of housing loans.",
        "In the opinion of these Council members, this confirmed the strong impact of NBP’s monetary policy on the economy.",
        "These Council members judged that the credit channel was effective, despite a slight increase in newly granted housing loans in the recent period, which, however, largely stemmed from the relaxation of supervisory recommendations regarding creditworthiness assessment conditions.",
        "Certain Council members expressed the opinion that a significant portion of household assets was very liquid, and thus could be used to finance consumption, and that overpayment of loans taken out earlier in response to the increase in interest rates reduced the strength of the impact of the credit channel.",
        "These Council members also pointed out that, following the earlier strong growth, interest rates on certain types of loans and deposits had declined somewhat.",
        "In addition, certain Council members argued that along with the expected economic recovery in 2023 Q2, lending should be expected to accelerate.",
        "The majority of the Council members assessed that the weakening of the external economic conditions, together with a decline in commodity prices, would continue to curb global inflation, which would contribute to lower price growth in Poland.",
        "The decline in domestic inflation would be supported by the weakening of GDP growth, including consumption, amid a significant decrease in credit growth.",
        "As a result, the majority of the Council members assessed that the earlier strong monetary policy tightening undertaken by NBP would lead to a decline in inflation in Poland towards the NBP inflation target.",
        "At the same time, given the strength and persistence of the earlier shocks, which remained beyond the impact of domestic monetary policy, the return of inflation to the NBP inflation target would be gradual.",
        "Alongside that, it was underlined that the Council flexibly determined the desirable time necessary to bring inflation back to the target, as bringing inflation rapidly back to the target might entail significant costs to macroeconomic and financial stability.",
        "The Council members upheld the assessment that the decrease in inflation would be faster if supported by an appreciation of the zloty exchange rate, which, in the Council’s assessment, would be consistent with the fundamentals of the Polish economy.",
        "The majority of Council members recognised that, taking into account the above conditions, and in particular the expected gradual decline in inflation, the weakening of the domestic economic conditions, including the fall in consumer demand, decline in inflation expectations, low growth in monetary aggregates, including low lending growth, and also the decline in inflationary pressure abroad combined with the risks to the global economic outlook, and taking into account the earlier strong monetary policy tightening, it was justified to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged.",
        "Certain Council members expressed the opinion that given the persistently high price growth and elevated inflation expectations, the hitherto scale of interest rate hikes by NBP was insufficient to ensure the return of inflation to the target in the medium term and to lower inflation expectations to levels consistent with the medium-term inflation target.",
        "In the opinion of those Council members, the disinflation process as foreseen by the forecasts, and particularly the decline in core inflation, would be too slow.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 6.75%, the lombard rate at 7.25%, the deposit rate at 6.25%, the rediscount rate at 6.80%, and the discount rate at 6.85%.",
        "The Council pointed out that further decisions of the Council would depend on incoming information regarding prospects for inflation and economic activity.",
        "At the meeting it was pointed out that global economic conditions remained subdued.",
        "In particular, it was indicated that economic growth in the euro area had probably been close to zero in 2023 Q1, and according to available forecasts would remain low throughout the whole of the year.",
        "However, attention was drawn to the fact that the scale of the slowdown in global activity was smaller than previously expected.",
        "The Council members pointed out that in recent months global commodity prices – including both energy and agricultural commodities – had fallen, although oil prices had risen in response to the decision of the OPEC+ at the beginning of April to reduce oil production.",
        "Moreover, it was underlined that the global supply chain disruptions were easing, which supported global economic activity, and at the same time lowered inflationary pressure.",
        "Some Council members drew attention to the turmoil in the banking sector in the United States and Europe as a new risk factor for the economic conditions abroad.",
        "This turmoil might translate into an additional tightening of bank lending in the affected countries, which could adversely impact their GDP growth prospects.",
        "As a result, in the past weeks market expectations regarding interest rate developments in the coming quarters, among others in the United States and the euro area, had declined significantly, which was consistent with a certain softening of communication by the Federal Reserve of the United States and the European Central Bank regarding their monetary policy prospects.",
        "It was noted that in the recent period consumer price growth in the United States and the euro area had declined, although – as certain Council members pointed out – due to the scale of the earlier shocks, their secondary effects and relatively fast nominal wage growth, the process of inflation returning to central banks’ targets in the major economies would be slow, as signalled also by the still high core inflation in most economies.",
        "In this context, it was underlined that inflation in 2024 would also be above the inflation targets of the Fed and the ECB.",
        "Certain Council members judged that – particularly in view of the lower market expectations regarding interest rate developments in the major economies and the increase in oil prices in the past days – this might lower the anti-inflationary impact of the decline in inflationary pressure abroad on prices in Poland.",
        "Some Council members highlighted that inflation – despite its decline – remained exceptionally high in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.",
        "When referring to the current economic situation, some Council members judged that the incoming data confirmed the economic slowdown.",
        "They observed that, in particular, in February industrial output had declined and retail sales were 5% lower than a year ago, which – although partly resulted from base effects – signalled a further and perhaps stronger than previously expected fall in consumption at the beginning of 2023.",
        "These Council members also drew attention to the slight decline of the PMI for Polish manufacturing in April, which had been running below 50 points for many months.",
        "Meanwhile, certain Council members were of the opinion that already in 2023 Q2 a gradual recovery in economic activity could be expected that may accelerate in 2023 Q3.",
        "It was pointed out that the labour market situation remained good and the unemployment rate in Poland was among the lowest in the European Union (second lowest).",
        "However, some Council members observed that gradually weakening demand for labour was reflected in a significant fall in the number of new jobs and vacancies in the economy in 2022 Q4 as well as in a slowdown in annual growth of employment in the enterprise sector in February 2023.",
        "Alongside that, in February nominal wage growth in the enterprise sector was close to the January figure, which was partly the result of further payments of bonuses in mining and the increase in the minimum wage.",
        "Real wages, however, continued to decline, which should support disinflation.",
        "Other Council members pointed out that although February had seen a fall in employment in the enterprise sector (also in seasonally adjusted month-to-month terms), the fall had been small.",
        "These Council members also judged that nominal wage growth – even excluding mining and the increase in the minimum wage – was still high, particularly in certain sections.",
        "At the meeting it was pointed out that – according to Statistics Poland preliminary data – in March 2023 annual CPI inflation declined by over 2 percentage points compared to February (to 16.2% from 18.4% in February), which largely reflected the fall in energy price growth.",
        "In turn, limited supply of vegetables and meat continued to boost food prices.",
        "As a result, in March the growth in food prices had not yet fallen, although some Council members expressed the opinion that food price growth should soon slow down.",
        "It was underlined that preliminary estimates also indicated an increase in core inflation, which – according to NBP forecasts – should soon begin to gradually decline.",
        "Certain Council members emphasised that the CPI index in month-to-month terms and the estimated level of core inflation in March remained high.",
        "Moreover, these Council members drew attention to the fact that the fall in the annual inflation rate in March 2023 had been driven by the base effect.",
        "When assessing the inflation outlook, the majority of the Council members were of the opinion that price growth would keep declining markedly, continuing the initiated process of gradual disinflation.",
        "It was underlined that in view of the significant fall in consumption, half of the firms surveyed by NBP had declared difficulties in passing on rising costs to the prices of final goods, whilst until now some enterprises had conducted a price policy aimed not only at compensating rising costs, but also at increasing margins.",
        "However, some Council members argued that the price dynamics of certain services could be a factor that would hamper the fall in inflation.",
        "At the same time, it was underlined that inflation expectations of enterprises had been declining for some time, which should support expectations of a fall in inflation in the following quarters.",
        "In addition, certain Council members pointed to the further decline in annual growth of producer prices, which would also support the disinflation process.",
        "Alongside that, other Council members observed that some of the incoming data signalled greater persistence of inflation, which increased the risks to lowering it towards the target in the following years.",
        "These Council members pointed out that in month-to-month terms, the PPI index excluding goods related to energy was slightly positive.",
        "During the discussion attention was drawn to the significant impact of the strong monetary policy tightening by NBP on the monetary conditions.",
        "It was pointed out that as a result of the marked increase in the cost of debt, a very substantial decline in lending growth had taken place, including a fall in the stock of household loans, as well as a decline in the M1 monetary aggregate alongside an increase in term deposits.",
        "In this context, certain Council members observed that the interest rate hikes conducted so far were significantly impacting the financial situation of borrowers.",
        "In effect, keeping interest rates at their current levels should mitigate the risk of excessive growth of debt in the economy.",
        "However, certain Council members underlined that the estimated real interest rates were negative, which – in the opinion of these Council members – might hamper the lowering of inflation.",
        "Other Council members also pointed out that in previous months – following the earlier strong growth – interest rates on certain types of loans had declined somewhat.",
        "The majority of the Council members assessed that the weakening of the external economic conditions, together with a decline in commodity prices, would continue to curb global inflation, which would contribute to lower price growth in Poland.",
        "The decline in domestic inflation would be supported by the weakening of GDP growth, including consumption, amid a significant decrease in credit growth.",
        "As a result, the majority of the Council members assessed that the earlier strong monetary policy tightening undertaken by NBP would lead to a decline in inflation in Poland towards the NBP inflation target.",
        "At the same time, given the strength and persistence of the earlier shocks, which remained beyond the impact of domestic monetary policy, the return of inflation to the NBP inflation target would be gradual.",
        "Alongside that, it was underlined that the Council flexibly determined the desirable time necessary to bring inflation back to the target, as bringing inflation rapidly back to the target might entail significant costs to macroeconomic and financial stability.",
        "The decrease in inflation would be faster if supported by an appreciation of the zloty exchange rate, which, in the Council’s assessment, would be consistent with the fundamentals of the Polish economy.",
        "The majority of the Council members recognised that, taking into account the above conditions, and in particular the expected gradual decline in inflation, the weakening of the domestic economic conditions, including the fall in consumer demand, decline in inflation expectations, low growth in monetary aggregates, including low lending growth, and also the decline in inflationary pressure abroad combined with the risks to the global economic outlook, and taking into account the earlier strong monetary policy tightening, it was justified to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged.",
        "Certain Council members expressed the opinion that given the persistently high price growth and elevated inflationary expectations, the hitherto scale of interest rate hikes by NBP was insufficient to ensure the return of inflation to the target in the medium term and to lower inflation expectations to levels consistent with the medium-term inflation target.",
        "In the opinion of those Council members, the disinflation process as foreseen by the forecasts, and particularly the decline in core inflation, would be too slow.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 6.75%, the lombard rate at 7.25%, the deposit rate at 6.25%, the rediscount rate at 6.80%, and the discount rate at 6.85%.",
        "The Council pointed out that further decisions of the Council would depend on incoming information regarding prospects for inflation and economic activity.",
        "At the meeting, it was pointed out that the economic conditions in the environment of the Polish economy remained subdued.",
        "In the euro area, annual growth in activity continued to slow down in 2023 Q1.",
        "At the same time, in Germany GDP contracted and the level of economic activity was lower than before the outbreak of the pandemic.",
        "It was underlined that in the United States the economic conditions remained better than in Europe, although growth in activity was lower than the long-term average for the US economy in 2023 Q1.",
        "Some Council members also pointed out that the economic recovery in China after the country’s departure from its previous zero-Covid policy had so far been limited.",
        "It was pointed out that the effects of the commodity shock continued to have a negative impact on the global economic situation, while it was underlined that this shock was gradually subsiding.",
        "Nevertheless, its lagged effects were still having an adverse impact on the economies, particularly in the euro area and countries of the Central-Eastern Europe region.",
        "In particular, it was pointed out that the annual growth in prices remained high, which was causing a decline in real household income.",
        "As a result, retail sales were falling significantly in many economies.",
        "The Council members underlined that global monetary tightening, which was slowing down credit growth, was also having a negative impact on global economic activity.",
        "Forecasts indicated that GDP growth in the euro area would be relatively low in 2023.",
        "At the same time, GDP growth in the United States was to remain moderate in 2023.",
        "It was emphasised that the global economic activity outlook remained uncertain, among others, due to tensions in the banking sector in the United States, with certain Council members pointing to somewhat easing of these tensions.",
        "The Council members pointed out that global inflation was declining.",
        "Recently, inflation had fallen in both the euro area and the United States, as well as in the Central-Eastern Europe region.",
        "At the same time, it was underlined that in all these economies inflation remained high, and in the Central-Eastern Europe region it was still in double digits.",
        "At the same time, attention was drawn to a fall in core inflation in the environment of the Polish economy.",
        "In May, it declined for the second time in a row in the euro area.",
        "It was pointed out that core inflation had also begun to decline in the countries of the Central Eastern Europe region, although in most of them it was still over 10%.",
        "The Council members emphasised that the decline in global inflation was supported by the fading away of the supply shocks, including in the commodities market and in global trade, as well as by the limited demand for goods by households.",
        "As a result, producer price growth is quickly declining around the world.",
        "Despite this, the fall in inflation in many economies is gradual, since the rapid growth in nominal wages, the relatively good economic situation in services, as well as the pass through of the earlier sharp increases in production costs on consumer prices and the relatively high corporate profits are supporting further price growth.",
        "At the Council meeting, it was pointed out that recently the central banks in some advanced economies had raised interest rates.",
        "In turn, many central banks of the emerging economies, including in the Central-Eastern Europe region, are keeping interest rates unchanged.",
        "Amid the weakening of economic growth around the world, activity growth had also slowed down in Poland.",
        "Annual GDP growth stood at -0.3% in 2023 Q1.",
        "It was underlined that the data on a slowdown of GDP growth was consistent with the March projection.",
        "The base effect due to the sharp growth in inventories in 2022 Q1 contributed to lower annual GDP growth.",
        "It was pointed out that the slowdown in economic activity supported disinflation.",
        "Moreover, the majority of Council members pointed out that the structure of GDP growth was favourable from the point of view of a fall in price growth.",
        "In particular, the decline in consumption was giving enterprises less leeway for price increases.",
        "At the same time, some Council members pointed out that investment growth was supporting the expansion of production capacity, which in the medium term should additionally support disinflation.",
        "At the same time, attention was drawn to the fact that monthly data for April 2023 showed a deeper fall in industrial output.",
        "Retail sales also decreased, falling again by over 7% y/y in April.",
        "As a result, some Council members judged that growth in economic activity in 2023 Q2 might be lower than earlier expected.",
        "Certain Council members underlined in this context that a fuller assessment of the economic outlook would be possible after getting acquainted with the results of the July inflation and GDP projection.",
        "The Council members pointed out that despite a slowdown in economic activity growth, the labour market situation continued to be good and unemployment was low.",
        "However, the majority of Council members underlined that the monthly data confirmed a gradual slowdown in demand for labour.",
        "The employment growth in annual terms in the enterprise sector in recent months was decelerating, although the LFS data showed that the number of employed persons is high.",
        "It was underlined that according to the Social Insurance Institution (ZUS), in April 2023 the number of employment contracts had declined in annual terms for the first time in two years.",
        "At the same time, annual nominal wage growth in enterprises slowed down once again in April, which translated into a further fall in real wages.",
        "Certain Council members drew attention to the high growth in unit labour costs.",
        "In this context, these Council members also pointed to the further increase in the minimum wage in 2023, which would boost wage growth in the economy.",
        "The Council members underlined that in line with earlier forecasts, inflation in Poland was decreasing.",
        "According to the Statistics Poland flash estimate, CPI inflation fell to 13.0% y/y in May 2023 and was the lowest for over a year.",
        "It was emphasised that in the last three months inflation had fallen by over 5 percentage points.",
        "At the same time, in May 2023 the overall level of consumer prices was unchanged as compared to April 2023.",
        "In this context, the majority of the Council members drew attention to the fact that the still high annual inflation rate was therefore not evidence of current growth in the overall level of prices, but was the result of the history of price changes in previous months.",
        "It was pointed out that while in previous months the fall in the annual inflation rate had been almost exclusively due to a decline in the annual growth in food and energy prices, it could be estimated that in May 2023 core inflation had also fallen.",
        "It was underlined that growth in both prices of services and non-food products had most likely declined.",
        "Certain Council members expressed the opinion that price-setting processes in Poland, like in other countries, were currently following a different pattern than in a low inflation period.",
        "In the opinion of these Council members, the decline in the annual CPI index mainly reflected the base effects and the fall in commodity prices, and the impact of the previous NBP interest rate hikes was not sufficient.",
        "The Council members judged that in line with the available forecasts, price growth, including core inflation, would proceed to fall.",
        "It was pointed out that price growth would adjust to the weakened economic conditions, and at the same time the fading away of the global supply shocks and cost pressure would have a disinflationary effect.",
        "It was emphasised that the sharp slowdown in producer price inflation, which stood at 6.8% y/y in April, while in the summer of 2022 was over 25%, indicated a weakening of cost pressure.",
        "The majority of the Council members underlined that NBP's strong monetary policy tightening, which had contributed to a decline in credit debt in the Polish economy and in the M1 monetary aggregate, had also contributed to the decrease in inflation.",
        "The majority of the Council members therefore pointed out that the high level of NBP interest rates was still having anti-inflationary effects.",
        "Moreover, these Council members also drew attention to the continuation of the fall in the measures of inflation expectations, including of consumers and enterprises.",
        "It was also judged that the disinflation process was supported by the marked appreciation of the zloty observed in recent months.",
        "Some Council members pointed out that a squeeze on corporate margins, which had been relatively high in some sectors in previous quarters, would also be conducive to a fall in inflation.",
        "At the same time, certain Council members were of the opinion that the decrease in inflation in the coming quarters might be faster than current forecasts indicated.",
        "However, certain Council members judged that a significant portion of enterprises and consumers still expected relatively high inflation and that the median of price growth forecasts made by market analysts had remained stable in the recent period.",
        "At the same time, they judged that the pace of decline in inflation might be slower than the path outlined in the March projection.",
        "The majority of the Council members assessed that the weakening of the external economic conditions, together with a decline in commodity prices, would continue to curb global inflation, which would still contribute to lower price growth in Poland.",
        "The decline in domestic inflation would be supported by the weakening of domestic GDP growth, including consumption, amid a significant decrease in credit growth.",
        "As a result, the majority of the Council members assessed that the earlier strong monetary policy tightening undertaken by NBP would lead to a decline in inflation in Poland towards the NBP inflation target.",
        "At the same time, given the strength and persistence of the earlier shocks, which remained beyond the impact of domestic monetary policy, the return of inflation to the NBP inflation target would be gradual.",
        "Alongside that, it was underlined that the Council flexibly determined the desirable time necessary to bring inflation back to the target, as bringing inflation rapidly back to the target might entail significant costs to macroeconomic and financial stability.",
        "The Council members upheld the assessment that the decrease in inflation would be faster if supported by an appreciation of the zloty exchange rate, which, in the Council’s assessment, would be consistent with the fundamentals of the Polish economy.",
        "The majority of Council members recognised that, taking into account the above conditions, and in particular the expected gradual decline in inflation, the weakening of the domestic economic conditions, including the fall in consumer demand, decline in inflation expectations, low growth in monetary aggregates, including low credit growth, and also the decline in inflationary pressure abroad combined with the risks to the global economic outlook, and taking into account the earlier strong monetary policy tightening, it was justified to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged.",
        "Certain Council members expressed the opinion that given the persistently high price growth and elevated inflation expectations, the hitherto scale of interest rate hikes by NBP was insufficient to ensure the return of inflation to the target in the medium term and to lower inflation expectations to levels consistent with the medium-term inflation target.",
        "In the opinion of those Council members, the disinflation process as foreseen by the forecasts, and particularly the decline in core inflation, would be too slow.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 6.75%, the lombard rate at 7.25%, the deposit rate at 6.25%, the rediscount rate at 6.80%, and the discount rate at 6.85%.",
        "The Council pointed out that further decisions of the Council would depend on incoming information regarding prospects for inflation and economic activity.",
        "At the meeting, it was pointed out that some of the recently incoming data from abroad had proved better than expected and that forecasts of GDP growth for 2023 for the major economies had been revised slightly upwards, although they continued to signal a slowdown in GDP growth compared to 2022 and their risks were skewed to the downside.",
        "At the same time, it was observed that global economic conditions remained weak as indicated by, among others, the slowdown in GDP growth in 2022 Q4 in the largest economies.",
        "This was accompanied by uncertainty related to, among others, a possible escalation of the war in Ukraine, and to the consequences of China’s departure from its restrictive pandemic policies.",
        "The Council members pointed out that in recent months inflation in many economies had begun to decline, although it remained high.",
        "It was emphasised that the fall in inflation had been supported by the decline in energy commodity prices and the easing of global supply chain tensions, as well as the weakening of demand.",
        "As a result, in December 2022, inflation – including core inflation – continued to decline in the United States.",
        "In the euro area, the headline consumer inflation had also fallen, while core inflation had not yet begun to decline.",
        "It was pointed out that many central banks were continuing to tighten monetary policy.",
        "In particular, this was the case of the Federal Reserve of the United States and the European Central Bank, which had once again increased interest rates in February.",
        "Some Council members underlined that these banks had begun interest rate hikes much later than NBP, and that the total scale of the hitherto monetary policy tightening in the United States and the euro area was significantly smaller than in Poland.",
        "Other Council members pointed out that although the Fed and ECB interest rates were lower than the NBP rates, consumer inflation in the United States and the euro area was also lower.",
        "At the same time, certain Council members observed that following previous large interest rate hikes, most central banks in the Central and Eastern European countries outside the euro area had recently kept interest rates unchanged.",
        "While analysing the situation in the Polish economy, the Council members pointed out that in line with the Statistics Poland preliminary estimate, GDP growth in 2022 had slowed down to 4.9% (from 6.8% in 2021).",
        "It was emphasised that these data were somewhat better than anticipated in NBP’s November projection, yet they confirmed that growth in 2022 had gradually weakened.",
        "GDP growth in 2022 Q4 – implied from the Statistics Poland preliminary data for the whole of 2022 – was approx.",
        "The Statistics Poland preliminary data also indicated that private consumption had probably declined, despite increased sales of goods due to the inflow of Ukrainian refugees to Poland.",
        "Some Council members also underlined that monthly data for December on retail sales and industrial as well as construction and assembly output, which showed a marked decline in growth of these categories, likewise indicated a slowdown in economic activity at the end of 2022.",
        "At the same time, certain confidence indicators from the beginning of 2023 had improved, although they remained low, and suggested a further deceleration in GDP growth in annual terms.",
        "Some Council members pointed out that consumption data were particularly important in the context of economic developments, because – should the decline in consumption in 2022 Q4 be confirmed – it would signal a reduction in consumer demand pressure.",
        "When assessing the outlook for the Polish economy, the majority of Council members drew attention to the fact that consumption in the coming quarters might continue to run at a low level, curbed by the earlier and current increase in prices, including energy prices, high interest rates and the persistence of relatively weak sentiment.",
        "These Council members observed that high energy prices, high interest rates and the persisting uncertainty would also curb investment activity.",
        "Moreover, they pointed out that according to the Statistics Poland survey, in January 2023 capacity utilisation in manufacturing was the lowest since 2015, excluding the two quarters of the pandemic crisis of 2020.",
        "Amid global monetary tightening and low activity growth abroad, export growth might also be limited.",
        "However, in the opinion of some Council members, Poland might benefit from the shifting of production closer to the destination countries, i.e.",
        "so called nearshoring, particularly as a supplier of cheaper substitutes, as well as from the further growth of exports to Ukraine.",
        "In the opinion of the majority of the Council members, taking into account all these factors, GDP growth in Poland in 2023 would be lower than in previous years.",
        "Yet, certain Council members judged that reduced consumption could not be expected to be a disinflationary factor in the coming quarters.",
        "The Council members pointed out that despite weaker economic conditions, the situation in the labour market remained good, as evidenced by low unemployment rate and a steadily rising employment in the enterprise sector.",
        "However, some Council members indicated that the survey data from both the Statistics Poland and the NBP signalled a gradual weakening of demand for labour in the Polish economy.",
        "At the same time, wage growth in the enterprise sector in 2022 Q4 slowed down and in December stood at 10.3%.",
        "It was underlined that the slowdown in wage growth was seen in almost every sector.",
        "Moreover, it was indicated that nominal wage growth was lower than inflation.",
        "Alongside that, certain Council members stressed that in most of market services sector wage growth was still very high, which – in their opinion – was contributing to continued strong propensity of enterprises to raise prices, despite a slight decline in firms’ declarations of further increases in the prices of their own products in the recent period.",
        "At the meeting, it was indicated that the annual CPI in Poland in December 2022 had declined to 16.6%.",
        "It was observed that like in November, this was driven primarily by slower energy price growth.",
        "Moreover, some Council members pointed to the fact that in December 2022 also the annual food price growth had declined – for the first time since February 2021.",
        "In turn, core inflation net of food and energy prices had increased to 11.5%.",
        "It was noted that PPI inflation had declined again, which – along with the rising percentage of companies surveyed by NBP expecting producer price growth to slow down – might denote weakening cost pressure in the economy.",
        "Certain Council members pointed out that the recent decline in sales profitability might also be evidence of firms having less leeway to continue passing through cost increases into their product prices.",
        "It was additionally emphasised that in January households’ inflation expectations had decreased further, although – as certain Council members observed – this was mainly due to a decline in the level of perceived inflation.",
        "When discussing the outlook for inflation in Poland, the Council members pointed out that the CPI index would probably increase in the early months of 2023, in line with what forecasts had indicated for a long time.",
        "This would mainly result from the withdrawal of some of the reduced tax rates under the so-called Anti-inflationary Shield, the rise in energy prices and the base effect related to the reduction, a year earlier, in the VAT rate on food.",
        "At the same time, the majority of the Council members emphasised that according to the available forecasts, from 2023 Q2 inflation should gradually decline towards the medium-term NBP target (2.5% +/- 1 pp.).",
        "The majority of the Council members observed that the decline in the annual price growth in the subsequent months of 2023 would be supported by the base effect, as well as weaker upward pressure on prices driven by the fading of the previous supply shocks and the weakening in economic conditions, which, along with the decline in real wages, would constrain enterprises’ capacity to pass the rising costs on to product prices.",
        "In the opinion of these Council members, the disinflation process would be supported by the materialisation of the effects of the hitherto substantial monetary policy tightening by NBP, combined with tighter global financial conditions curbing both global economic activity growth and commodity prices.",
        "These Council members emphasised that although core inflation would decrease with a delay, this would largely be due to the persisting effects of the earlier shocks, including the cost ones.",
        "The Council members observed that from mid-2023, core inflation would account for most of the overall inflation.",
        "The impact of the strong monetary policy tightening by NBP on monetary conditions in the Polish economy was also highlighted.",
        "In this context, it was noted that lending, particularly to households, had slowed down very substantially.",
        "Furthermore, it was argued that even taking into account the so-called loan repayment holidays, the impact of higher mortgage debt service costs on household disposable income would be greater in 2023 than in 2022, which meant a further tightening in monetary conditions despite the NBP interest rates being kept unchanged.",
        "Some Council members also emphasised that the hitherto increases in NBP interest rate had translated into a decline in the more liquid components of the monetary aggregates, including cash.",
        "Certain Council members pointed to the announced easing of the supervisory recommendations on credit scoring terms for certain loans.",
        "However, other Council members stressed that with regard to variable rate loans, the recommendation on higher credit buffor was uphold.",
        "The majority of the Council members assessed that the weakening in the external economic conditions, together with monetary policy tightening by major central banks would curb global inflation and commodity prices.",
        "The deterioration in global economic conditions was also hampering economic growth in Poland.",
        "Under such circumstances, the hitherto significant monetary policy tightening by NBP would support a decline in inflation in Poland towards the NBP inflation target.",
        "At the same time, given the strength and persistence of the previous shocks, that remain beyond the impact of domestic monetary policy, in the short term inflation would remain high, and its return to the NBP inflation target would be gradual.",
        "Alongside that, it was underlined that the Council flexibly determined the desirable time necessary to bring inflation back to the target, as bringing inflation rapidly back to the target might entail significant costs to macroeconomic and financial stability.",
        "The decrease in inflation would be faster if supported by appreciation of the zloty exchange rate, which, in the Council’s assessment, would be consistent with the fundamentals of the Polish economy.",
        "In the opinion of the Council, considering the expected scenario of the gradual return of inflation to the NBP inflation target in the coming years, amid the deterioration in domestic economic conditions, including in the labour market, and the incoming signals of the global inflationary pressure slowing down, it was justified to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged.",
        "Certain Council members expressed the opinion that given the persistently high price growth and elevated inflation expectations, the hitherto scale of interest rate hikes by NBP was insufficient to ensure the return of inflation to the target in the medium term and to lower inflation expectations to levels consistent with the medium-term inflation target.",
        "In the opinion of those Council members, the disinflation process as foreseen by the forecasts, and particularly the decline in core inflation, would be too slow.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 6.75%, the lombard rate at 7.25%, the deposit rate at 6.25%, the rediscount rate at 6.80%, and the discount rate at 6.85%.",
        "The Council members pointed out that further decisions of the Council would depend on incoming information regarding the perspectives for inflation and economic activity, including the impact of the Russian military aggression against Ukraine on the Polish economy.",
        "At the meeting, it was noted that the economic conditions in the external environment of the Polish economy remained weakened, and that uncertainty about the activity outlook persisted.",
        "Incoming data pointed to a likely further slowdown of GDP growth in the euro area in 2023 Q3, including a steeper decline in activity in Germany.",
        "As a consequence, growth forecasts for the euro area had also deteriorated, signalling that the recovery in 2024 would be weaker than previously expected.",
        "It was observed that one of the risk factors to growth in the environment of the Polish economy was the effect on the euro area economy of the monetary policy tightening by the European Central Bank.",
        "At the same time, it was emphasised that economic conditions in the United States remained favourable.",
        "The Council members observed that the disinflation process was advancing across the world.",
        "It was pointed out that according to the Eurostat flash estimate, inflation in the euro area had fallen to 4.3% in September, on the back of a substantial decline in core inflation.",
        "In Central and Eastern Europe, price growth was also decreasing, although it remained higher than in the euro area.",
        "In the United States, core inflation was gradually declining.",
        "The Council members drew attention to the fact that producer price growth in some major economies was negative, which evidenced weak cost pressures.",
        "It was underscored that the European Central Bank and the United States Federal Reserve were expecting further disinflation, but they assumed inflation return to the inflation targets not earlier then in the second half of 2025.",
        "Certain Council members pointed out that those banks signalled keeping interest rates at an elevated level for a longer period.",
        "Amid the weakened global economic conditions, activity growth in Poland had also remained subdued.",
        "The Council members noted that retail sales and industrial output had declined in annual terms in August 2023, although the fall was somewhat smaller than in the previous month.",
        "It was also observed that the PMI indicator remained low, which pointed to a further decline in industrial activity.",
        "At the same time, construction and assembly output growth had increased.",
        "Taking into account incoming monthly data, the Council members argued that the annual GDP growth in 2023 Q3 was likely to have risen somewhat, while still remaining low.",
        "There had probably been another decline in consumption in annual terms, as well as in exports and imports.",
        "Activity growth in Q3 had also probably been lower than forecast in the July projection and markedly lower than the potential growth rate.",
        "As a result, incoming data pointed to a deepening of a negative output gap and to the continuation of weak demand pressure in the Polish economy.",
        "It was judged that although activity growth remained low, it was set to rise in the following quarters.",
        "In this context, certain Council members were of the opinion that retail sales data might be a sign of a recovery in consumption.",
        "During the meeting, it was pointed out that despite the slowdown in economic activity growth, good labour market conditions continued, including low unemployment.",
        "Although the number of working persons remained high, in August 2023 annual employment growth in the enterprise sector had slowed down to zero, and the number of full-time equivalents had declined in month-on-month terms.",
        "As a result, the sector’s total employment was lower than at the beginning of 2023.",
        "It was also highlighted that firms’ assessments of future employment levels, covered by the PMI indicator, were deteriorating, and that households’ concerns about unemployment rose.",
        "Certain Council members underlined that – in their opinion – wage growth in some sections was high.",
        "According to the majority of the Council members, the effects of the previous NBP monetary policy tightening were still observed in the credit market.",
        "In August, both the annual and monthly rate of change in bank loans to the economy had remained negative, and in particular there was a fall in the value of housing loans.",
        "As a result, the ratio of credit-to-GDP remained at its lowest levels in more than a decade, which – in the opinion of most Council members – was a sign that bank lending was currently not an inflationary factor.",
        "At the meeting it was pointed out that the annual CPI index had again fallen markedly in September 2023, running at 8.2% according to the Statistics Poland flash estimate.",
        "The Council members noted that this reading had turned out to be below market expectations.",
        "It was emphasised that the annual inflation had declined by more than 10 percentage points within the past seven months, and that during the past five months the general price level even decreased somewhat.",
        "In September, there had been a decline in price growth across all the main categories of the inflation basket.",
        "The Council members observed that based on the available data – apart from slower growth in food and energy prices – also core inflation could be estimated to have fallen again in September 2023, and that the fall had been significant.",
        "Attention was also drawn to the fact that the annual change of PPI index had been negative again in August.",
        "Thus, it was assessed that the decline in inflation resulted from both lower demand pressure and lower cost pressure.",
        "The Council members emphasised that the fall in inflation was accompanied by a drop in inflation expectations, and according to survey data, companies had again lowered the declared pace of further increases in the prices of their products.",
        "The majority of the Council members judged that the marked decline in inflation and the lowering of inflation expectations were contributing to an increase in the restrictiveness of monetary policy.",
        "While discussing the outlook for inflation in Poland, the majority of the Council members pointed out that inflation would continue to decline.",
        "Based on incoming data and forecasts, it was assessed that core inflation in the coming quarters might be lower than indicated in the July projection.",
        "It was also emphasised that inflation forecasts were subject to considerable uncertainty related, among others, to developments in the prices of energy commodities, including oil, as well as the level of VAT rates on food and the level of administered prices, including energy prices.",
        "In this context, it was pointed out that any potential rise in oil prices or taxes, on the one hand, would have a boosting effect on inflation and, on the other hand, would have a negative effect on real income and economic growth.",
        "Certain Council members were of the opinion that the pace of the recovery could pose a risk to the future disinflation process.",
        "The majority of the Council members judged that incoming data confirm weak demand and cost pressure in the economy as well as reduced inflation pressure amongst the weakened external economic conditions.",
        "Considering these circumstances – and taking into account the time lags in the monetary policy transmission to the economy – the Council adjusted the NBP interest rates, which is consistent with meeting the NBP inflation target in the medium term.",
        "Alongside that, it was underlined that the Council flexibly determined the desirable time necessary to bring inflation back to the target, as bringing inflation rapidly back to the target might entail significant costs to macroeconomic and financial stability.",
        "The Council members upheld the assessment that the decrease in inflation would be faster if supported by an appreciation of the zloty exchange rate, which, in the Council’s assessment, would be consistent with the fundamentals of the Polish economy.",
        "Certain Council members expressed the opinion that considering the uncertainty over the prospects of expected economic recovery and the pace of a further decline in inflation, it would be appropriate to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged on the current meeting.",
        "The view was expressed that given the persistently high annual price growth and elevated inflation expectations, the level of the NBP interest rates was too low to ensure the return of inflation to the target in the medium term and to lower inflation expectations to levels consistent with the medium-term inflation target.",
        "The Council decided to lower the NBP reference rate by 0.25 percentage points, i.e.",
        "At the same time, the Council set the remaining NBP interest rates at the following levels: the lombard rate at 6.25%, the deposit rate at 5.25%, the rediscount rate at 5.80%, and the discount rate at 5.85%.",
        "The Council pointed out that further decisions of the Council would depend on incoming information regarding prospects for inflation and economic activity.",
        "At the meeting, it was pointed out that the economic conditions in the environment of the Polish economy remained weakened and that uncertainty about the activity outlook persisted.",
        "In the euro area, annual GDP growth in 2023 Q2 slowed well below its long term average, while in Germany GDP contracted in annual terms.",
        "The Council underscored that data incoming in 2023 Q3 signalled a further deterioration in economic conditions in the euro area, including in Germany.",
        "Furthermore, it was observed that the recovery of activity in China following the departure from the so-called “zero-Covid” policy was unfolding much more slowly than expected.",
        "In turn, the current economic conditions in the United States remained better than in the euro area.",
        "Council members pointed out that the weak global economic conditions, along with the receding supply shocks, was having a disinflationary effect.",
        "According to the Eurostat flash estimate, inflation in the euro area stood at 5.3% in August.",
        "In the United States, inflation in July was markedly lower than in the euro area, although it continued to run above the inflation target.",
        "There has been a marked decline in inflation in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.",
        "It was observed that core inflation was also declining across the world, although at a slower pace, amid declining growth in goods prices, and still elevated services prices growth.",
        "Strong disinflationary trends are reflected in producer price indices, including in the economies important for global industry.",
        "It was emphasised that producer prices had fallen by about 6% y/y in Germany in July, while in China the annual PPI growth had been negative for ten months.",
        "Certain Council members observed that some major central banks, including the ECB and the Fed, were signalling that they would keep interest rates elevated for a longer period, because the upward pressure on prices in these economies remained heightened.",
        "By contrast, some Council members observed that these banks had started increasing their interest rate later than many other central banks.",
        "Amid the weakened global economic conditions, activity growth has also declined in Poland.",
        "According to the Statistics Poland preliminary estimate, the annual GDP growth in 2023 Q2 stood at -0.6%.",
        "Council members pointed out that this reading was markedly lower than forecast in the July projection.",
        "It was emphasised that consumer demand continued to decline, which was conducive to disinflation.",
        "At the same time, investment continued to rise.",
        "Certain Council members were of the opinion that the heavy inflow of refugees to Poland directly upon the onset of the Russian military aggression against Ukraine had boosted consumption in Poland in 2022, which, due to the statistical base effect, was currently hampering annual growth in this category.",
        "At the same time, an opinion was voiced that the present slowdown in the Polish economy was to a great extent structural in nature, related to energy transformation and the consequences of the COVID 19 pandemic.",
        "Incoming data indicate that in 2023 Q3 the economic conditions remained weak.",
        "Retail sales and industrial output in July 2023 declined in annual terms.",
        "Similarly, the PMI in industry signals weak economic conditions.",
        "In this context, Council members indicated that annual GDP growth in 2023 Q3 would be also probably lower than the predictions of the July projection.",
        "At the same time, it was judged that economic activity growth in Poland would gradually pick up in the following quarters, which should be supported by the fading of the previous supply shocks and the declining inflation.",
        "At the meeting it was pointed out that the situation in the labour market remained good, and that unemployment continued to be low.",
        "While the number of the working persons remained high, annual employment growth in the enterprise sector was slowing down, and nominal wage growth was gradually declining.",
        "The majority of Council members pointed out that the effects of the previous NBP monetary policy tightening were still being seen in the credit market.",
        "In July 2023, annual growth in credit in the economy, as well as cash in circulation and the M1 aggregate were negative.",
        "At the same time, the credit-to-GDP ratio remained at the lowest level in more than a decade.",
        "In this context, certain Council members pointed to what they thought was a considerable amount of newly extended loans and the recently rising number of applications for housing loans, which was fuelled by the launch of the so-called “Safe Credit” programme.",
        "Yet most of the Council members were of the opinion that the expected scale of the impact of this programme on macroeconomic developments would be limited.",
        "The Council members pointed out that the annual CPI inflation in August 2023 had decreased markedly once again and – according to Statistics Poland flash estimate – stood at 10.1%.",
        "It was emphasized that in half a year annual CPI inflation had fallen by more than 8 percentage points.",
        "It was also remarked that in recent months the overall price level had decreased.",
        "The fall in inflation in annual terms in August was mainly due to the fall in the annual growth of prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages.",
        "It was pointed out that on the basis of available data it could be estimated that in August core inflation had also declined again.",
        "Certain Council members indicated that core inflation remained high despite slower growth in economic activity.",
        "During the discussion it was pointed out that in July industrial producer prices had fallen in annual terms, while annual PPI growth had declined by over 27 percentage points since June 2022.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that enterprises were reporting growing difficulties in raising prices and that they were revising downwards their expectations regarding CPI inflation within a one-year horizon.",
        "It was indicated that production capacity utilization had also been falling.",
        "All consumer inflation expectations measures were also decreasing.",
        "The majority of the Council members judged that the marked decline in inflation and the lowering of inflation expectations were contributing to an increase in the restrictiveness of monetary policy.",
        "It was emphasized that this had been mirrored in the growth of real interest rates.",
        "In this context, it was pointed out that the NBP reference rate was higher than inflation expectations of market analysts within a one year horizon, which had significantly dropped recently.",
        "Certain Council members indicated, however, that the NBP reference rate remained lower than the quantified consumer inflation expectations within a one-year horizon.",
        "While discussing the outlook for inflation in Poland, the majority of the Council members indicated that the disinflation process was firming and that inflation would continue to decline.",
        "On the basis of incoming information and forecasts it was judged that annual growth of prices in September 2023 would fall again to stand below 10%.",
        "It was judged that in the coming quarters inflation would continue to decrease.",
        "It was indicated that taking into consideration information on lower demand pressure in the economy and regulatory factors, future price growth would probably stand below the predictions from the July projection.",
        "Certain Council members emphasized that predictions for inflation developments were contingent on the future scale and scope of support measures introduced in relation to the previous rise in global commodity prices.",
        "The majority of the Council members judged that the weaker domestic economic conditions – in particular, weaker demand pressure than previously expected – coupled with low growth of monetary and credit aggregates, a decrease in inflation expectations and cost pressure, as well as a drop in inflation pressure abroad and weak economic conditions in the environment of the Polish economy, would contribute to a faster return of inflation in Poland to the NBP inflation target.",
        "Considering these circumstances – and taking into account the time lags in the monetary policy transmission to the economy – the Council adjusted the NBP interest rates.",
        "In the opinion of the majority of Council members, following this adjustment, the level of interest rates will continue to support the return of inflation to the NBP inflation target in the medium term.",
        "Alongside that, it was underlined that the Council flexibly determined the desirable time necessary to bring inflation back to the target, as bringing inflation rapidly back to the target might entail significant costs to macroeconomic and financial stability.",

        "Certain Council members expressed the opinion that considering the uncertainty over the pace of a further decline in inflation, and given the prospects of economic recovery, the hitherto level of interest rates was optimal, yet they pointed out that in the future a reduction of interest rates might be justified.",
        "The view was expressed that given the persistently high annual price growth and elevated inflationary expectations, the level of the NBP interest rates was too low to ensure the return of inflation to the target in the medium term and to lower inflation expectations to levels consistent with the medium-term inflation target.",
        "The Council decided to lower the NBP reference rate by 0.75 percentage points, i.e.",
        "At the same time the Council set the remaining NBP interest rates at the following levels: the lombard rate at 6.50%; the deposit rate at 5.50%; the rediscount rate at 6.05%; the discount rate at 6.10%.",

        "However, certain Council members were of the opinion that the main factor behind the growth in demand in the euro area economy was the sharp fall in commodity prices, which increased real disposable income, while the impact of the ECB’s monetary policy on the economic activity was negligible.",
        "While discussing the economic outlook in the euro area, some Council members pointed out that the slowdown in growth in the emerging economies, including China and Russia, was a risk factor for the euro area economy.",
        "This slowdown had already translated into a fall in euro area exports to these economies.",
        "However, some Council members emphasised that in the recent period the risk of a sharp slowdown in economic growth in China had declined, which was indicated by the better than expected GDP data.",
        "Moreover, they pointed out that the economic slowdown observed so far in China had not had strong negative impact on economic activity in the euro area.",
        "Certain of these members also argued that – despite the slowdown – growth in China would remain markedly higher than in the developed economies, therefore it would not significantly limit GDP growth in the euro area.",

        "Referring to monetary policy of the major central banks, Council members emphasised that uncertainty about its outlook persisted.",
        "It was pointed out that despite the somewhat worse data in the United States, the Federal Reserve announced interest rate hike in the coming months.",
        "On the other hand, the ECB was signalling further monetary policy easing due to the persistence of very low price growth in the euro area.",
        "Council members emphasised that expectations of the ECB’s monetary easing and better than expected data from China had contributed to an improvement in sentiment in the financial markets.",
        "However, some Council members judged that volatility in the financial markets could once again increase along with the beginning of Fed’s monetary policy tightening, particularly in the context of continued risks to the economic situation in the emerging economies, including China.",
        "Referring to the economic situation in Poland, Council members pointed out that economic activity continued to expand steadily and that domestic demand remained the main driver of growth.",
        "It was emphasised that the situation in the labour market further improved, and employment in enterprises – like the number of job vacancies – was relatively high.",
        "At the same time, the unemployment rate was close to the pre-crisis level.",
        "Moreover, some Council members pointed to the acceleration in wage growth in enterprises in the recent month.",
        "Council members underlined that the robust labour market and the increase in the wage fund supported stable consumption growth.",
        "However, some Council members judged that consumption growth remained relatively low, which could be due to the sustained increase in the household saving rate, observed despite the low nominal NBP interest rates.",
        "When addressing the business conditions in Poland, Council members pointed to the stable growth in industrial output and the continued good situation of enterprises as indicated by business sentiment surveys.",
        "It was emphasised that these surveys suggested that despite the economic slowdown in China, Polish enterprises had not so far experienced considerable fall in sales.",
        "However, some Council members argued that despite the good economic situation, many enterprises were refraining from investments.",
        "They judged that this could be due to the continued uncertainty about the situation in the global economy or the lack of conviction as to the sustainability of the recovery in demand in Poland.",
        "While analysing the situation on the credit market, Council members pointed to the stable growth in lending in the economy, with a slight deceleration in lending to households and an increase in corporate lending growth.",
        "Certain Council members stressed that corporate demand for credit remained low due to the significant share of companies’ own funds in financing investments.",
        "It was also underlined that in the housing credit market there were no signs of growing imbalances.",
        "While discussing inflation developments in the economy, Council members emphasised that consumer price growth remained negative.",
        "It was pointed out that in October price growth was once again lower than its forecast.",
        "However, it was judged that low price growth remained to be a global phenomenon and resulted mainly from the sharp fall in commodity prices in the global markets.",
        "At the same time, Council members emphasised that low price growth was accompanied by stable GDP growth and improving labour market conditions.",
        "Certain Council members pointed out that the fall in prices – largely driven by low commodity prices – supported real incomes of consumers and limited production costs of enterprises.",
        "While discussing the November projection, it was pointed out that the coming quarters were expected to see further stable GDP growth, supported by domestic demand.",
        "At the same time, it was emphasised that the contribution of net exports to growth would remain negative.",
        "Despite this, Council members pointed to the lack of significant risk to the external balance of the economy.",
        "Some Council members judged that – in line with the projection – GDP growth in 2016 could temporarily decrease.",
        "This fall, however, would be associated with a temporarily lower inflow of EU funds due to the beginning of absorption of funds from the new budgetary perspective.",
        "However, certain Council members emphasised that the GDP growth forecast for the coming years was slightly lower than in the previous projection, which partly resulted from a downward revision of forecast for corporate investments.",
        "While analysing the results of the projection, Council members pointed out that due to stable GDP growth continuing above the potential rate, the output gap would gradually close.",
        "However, certain Council members expressed the view that so far observed and projected investment growth, would raise the potential output.",
        "As a result, growth of potential GDP could be faster than in the projection, which along with the forecast growth of actual GDP might not lead to the closure of the output gap in the projection horizon.",
        "At the same time, certain Council members emphasised that the lowering of the equilibrium unemployment rate would be a factor increasing the potential output of the economy and would simultaneously limit wage pressure in the economy.",
        "While discussing the outlook for inflation in the context of the projection, Council members judged that in the coming quarters price growth would slowly increase.",
        "Price growth would be supported by stable growth in demand observed against the background of an improving economic situation in the euro area and the robust domestic labour market.",
        "At the same time, certain Council members pointed out that the period of deflation had prolonged, and the expected return of inflation to the target in the projection had receded.",
        "Certain Council members expressed the opinion that since they expected low commodity prices to persist in the global markets, and due to the limited growth of demand in the environment of the Polish economy, and therefore also in Poland, there was a risk of price growth continuing at a very low level for more prolonged period.",
        "While referring to the projection, Council members pointed to the risk to the base scenario.",
        "The continued uncertainty about the global outlook, commodity prices and price growth in the environment of the Polish economy were emphasised.",
        "It was also stressed that due to the appointment of the new government, there was uncertainty about the future economic policy, particularly the shape of fiscal policy in the next year.",
        "While discussing interest rates, the Council assessed that they should remain unchanged.",
        "While justifying this decision, Council members argued that in the coming quarters price growth would rise slowly, which would be driven by stable economic growth and the gradual closing of the output gap.",
        "Council members emphasised that prolonged deflation in Poland was mainly related to the factors beyond the reach of domestic monetary policy, among others, low commodity prices and low price growth abroad.",
        "Certain Council members also expressed the opinion that although GDP growth might remain below potential, the source of the negative output gap would continue to be external, and therefore it would remain beyond the influence of domestic monetary policy.",
        "Some Council members argued that an additional factor in favour of a stabilisation of interest rates was the persisting uncertainty about the economic outlook abroad and the monetary policy of the main central banks, which could contribute to volatility in the financial markets, including volatility of exchange rates of the emerging economies.",
        "Some Council members also stressed the uncertainty about the shape of future economic policy, which should be taken into account in monetary policy decisions in order to ensure an optimal macroeconomic policy-mix.",
        "Certain Council members were of the opinion that although interest rates should remain unchanged at the current meeting, in the coming months it could not be excluded that a slight lowering of the rates might be needed.",
        "While justifying this view, these members pointed to the risk of deflation persisting longer than expected which would shift the prospects of inflation returning to the target, and the risk of a slowdown in economic growth.",

        "At the same time, it was underlined that the exchange rate of the zloty - despite a certain weakening in the recent period - remained relatively stable.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members, the volatility of the zloty is limited by the positive assessment of Poland by foreign investors, the effect of which is a significant share of long-term investors in structure of Poland's foreign debt.",
        "While analysing the situation in Poland’s real economy, Council members pointed to the continued stable GDP growth, and even its’ slight acceleration in 2015 Q3.",
        "The main growth factor continued to be consumer demand, supported by growing employment and positive household sentiment.",
        "At the same time, in the view of some of the Council members, growth of consumer spending remained moderate due to the relatively low nominal wage growth and a higher rate of voluntary saving than earlier.",
        "It was pointed out that the growth in investment also contributed to GDP growth, although it had slowed down in 2015 Q3 -.",
        "Certain Council members judged that the investment slowdown in the economy could be connected with the lower absorption of EU funds.",
        "In turn, according to some Council members, the corporate propensity to invest could be reduced by the uncertainty regarding the economic situation abroad.",
        "It was pointed out that net exports also had a positive contribution to GDP growth in 2015 Q3.",

        "These Council members pointed out that the corporate loans to GDP ratio in Poland was considerably lower than in the euro area.",
        "However, some Council members underlined that currently the growth of corporate loans - amidst low interest rates and their high availability - was not restricted by supply factors.",
        "At the same time, certain Council members judged that an increased financial burden imposed on the banking sector could most likely adversely affect the credit supply in the future.",
        "Referring to the outlook for economic growth, the majority of Council members believed that in the coming quarters GDP growth would remain relatively stable.",
        "Certain Council members even assessed that, provided GDP growth would not be weakened by external shocks, growth in 2016 could be higher than in 2015.",
        "The economic growth would continue to be supported by strong consumer demand and investment.",
        "However, it was pointed out that investment growth might slow down.",
        "The temporarily reduced inflow of EU funds in the initial phase of the new budget perspective would contribute to this process.",
        "In the opinion of certain Council members, corporate investment growth might be restricted by the relatively high level of investment outlays of enterprises in relation to fixed assets, and the moderate growth in demand, which did not create incentives to expand production capacity.",
        "Council members judged that – besides domestic demand – rising exports would also boost economic activity in Poland.",
        "Certain Council members were of the opinion that in connection with the current economic recovery in the euro area, export growth would be higher than GDP growth.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that the weakening of foreign trade related to the further slowdown in emerging economies remained the main risk for domestic economic activity.",
        "Certain Council members also judged that possible financial crises in the emerging economies and resulting weakening of the global economy might be the source of negative shocks for the Polish economy.",
        "While discussing inflation developments in Poland, Council members pointed out that the scale of consumer price deflation was gradually declining.",
        "Council members argued that in the coming quarters price growth would continue to rise, driven by further stable growth in economic activity and the robust domestic labour market.",
        "However, some Council members pointed out that the increase in price growth was slow and weaker than expected.",
        "Certain Council members highlighted that if wage growth did not pick up, the return of inflation to the target could lengthen.",
        "In this context, certain Council members pointed out that the announced unfreezing of wages in the public sector - in addition to the low unemployment - may contribute to a pickup in wage growth in 2016.",
        "Council members discussed monetary policy conducted in the years 2010-2015.",
        "It was assessed that in this period the long-term stability of prices in Poland had been maintained, despite the increased volatility of price growth in certain years.",
        "It was pointed out that inflation volatility was mainly the effect of sharp changes in commodity prices in global markets.",
        "At the same time is was emphasised that monetary policy supported the stability of the zloty, which during the term of office of the Council was one of the least volatile currencies.",
        "It was also underlined that the flexible response of monetary policy to shocks contributed to the maintenance of balanced economic growth and financial stability.",
        "In this context, Council members pointed to, above all, the low volatility of the output gap, the current account surplus, and the maintenance of lending growth at a stable level.",
        "While discussing interest rates, the Council assessed that they should remain unchanged.",
        "Council members argued that in the coming quarters price growth would pick up slowly, which would be driven by stable economic growth and the gradual closing of the output gap.",
        "Council members judged that in the light of available data and forecasts, the current level of interest rates is conducive to keeping the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and sustaining macroeconomic balance.",
        "Some Council members stressed that the persistence of uncertainty regarding the domestic and external developments also spoke in favour of interest rate stability.",
        "In this context, they pointed above all to the persistent risk of sharper weakening of growth in emerging economies and the expected growing divergence of monetary policies of the main central banks, which could contribute to an increase in volatility in financial markets.",
        "They also pointed to the uncertainty regarding the shape of future economic policy.",
        "Certain Council members thought that the Council should consider interest rate increases in the nearest months.",
        "They argued that this would provide more room for monetary easing in the event of strong external shocks.",
        "These Council members argued that in the absence of interest rate hikes, monetary policy would become procyclical, contributing to a deterioration of the current account balance and an increase in Poland's foreign liabilities.",
        "The rising dependence of the Polish economy on foreign finance could, in turn, limit the possibility to conduct countercyclical monetary policy in the future, due to the concerns about a sharp change in the zloty exchange rate and flows of foreign capital.",
        "However, certain Council members were of the opinion that although at the current meeting interest rates should remain unchanged, in the coming months – as the uncertainty about the determinants of monetary policy abates - it could be justified to lower them.",
        "These Council members pointed out that price growth was slow and inflation forecasts for the coming years were being revised downwards.",
        "These Council members also judged that a possible easing of monetary policy would contribute to a recovery of lending to enterprises which – particularly in the case of the SME sector – remained relatively weak.",
        "However, the easing of monetary policy could be pursued amid stable exchange rate.",
        "Other Council members argued that lowering interest rates would not contribute to acceleration of corporate lending – which was restricted by demand factors – yet it could have an adverse effect on the stability of the financial system.",
        "The Council decided to keep the basic NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 1.50%, the lombard rate at 2.50%, the deposit rate at 0.50% and the rediscount rate at 1.75%.",
        "At the same time, they pointed to a significant uncertainty about the economic growth outlook for China.",
        "Certain Council members argued that the decline in growth in China resulted mainly from economic growth rebalancing into a more consumer-based economy, which – in the longer term – might support conditions in exporters of consumer goods and services providers and firms providing them.",
        "The Council members were of the opinion that the slowdown in China and other emerging market economies had so far had a limited impact on economic activity in Poland’s main trading partners but highlighted that this impact might increase in the future.",
        "In the euro area, a moderate recovery continues, supported mainly by an improvement in labour market conditions and consumer demand growth, though economic conditions vary across euro area member states.",
        "In Germany, which is Poland’s main trading partner, growth in economic activity is stable and the surveys indicate high export orders in this country.",
        "However, certain Council members pointed out that the slowdown in China – led by lower growth in investment and production of goods for investment purposes – might prove a substantial headwind to growth in Germany, since capital-intensive goods were important to German exports.",
        "Moreover, certain Council members pointed out that even though data on economic activity in the United States had been recently somewhat worse than expected, GDP growth in this economy was still higher than in other major advanced economies, driven by a further improvement in labour market conditions.",
        "However, they highlighted that the labour force participation rate in the United States was the lowest since the 1970s, which could indicate limited resource utilization in this economy.",
        "While discussing price developments abroad, Council members emphasized that the renewed fall in commodity prices in recent months had translated into lower inflation in many economies, also in the euro area, where price growth in September remained negative.",
        "They also indicated that inflation expectations in the euro area had declined and inflation forecasts had been revised downwards in many advanced economies.",
        "The Council members also pointed to uncertainty about monetary policy abroad.",
        "They stressed that the Federal Reserve was expected to delay the interest rate increase.",
        "In turn, the European Central Bank did not rule out an extension of its asset purchase programme.",
        "In the opinion of certain Council members, such a decision might be beneficial for the Polish economy, as it could support economic activity in the euro area member states, including Germany.",
        "Certain Council members pointed also to still elevated volatility in the financial markets and a further depreciation of many emerging market currencies, including the zloty, albeit to a considerably lesser degree.",
        "In this context, certain Council members judged that loose monetary conditions in major advanced economies had contributed to a strong rise in financial asset and real estate prices in previous years.",
        "As a result, a sharper market correction than recently observed, amplified by low liquidity in certain markets, should be expected in their opinion.",
        "They emphasized that the expected monetary policy tightening in the United States could be a trigger for a debt crisis in many emerging market economies, particularly where the issuance of debt securities denominated in the United States dollar had increased in previous years.",
        "According to these Council members, due to strong economic ties, such a crisis could spread to other economies, also to some euro area member states.",
        "Discussing economic conditions in Poland, the Council members judged that, despite external risks, they remained favourable, supported by good labour market conditions, improved financial standing of enterprises, high capacity utilization, stable lending growth, as well as high price competitiveness of the Polish economy combined with ongoing economic recovery in Poland’s main trading partners.",
        "Some Council members, however, pointed out that industrial production and retail sales had grown less than expected in summer months, and sentiment in industry had reached its one-year low in September, which might point to a weakening in economic growth in Poland.",
        "Some of these members were of an opinion that the slowdown in Polish industry was cyclical; however, others believed that it rather resulted from adjustment in industrial output to lower demand for durable and capital goods in the global economy.",
        "While discussing the labour market conditions, the Council members pointed to further growth in employment and a gradual decline in the unemployment rate, as well as to moderate wage growth.",
        "Certain Council members expressed an opinion that ongoing employment growth coupled with only moderate wage growth indicated a rather positive assessment of Polish enterprises regarding future economic conditions.",
        "However, other Council members pointed to labour market tensions resulting from difficulties in finding suitably skilled workers.",
        "As a result, the pace of improvement in labour market conditions, measured by employment growth, had levelled off in recent months.",
        "During a discussion on household sector conditions, it was highlighted that the voluntary household savings rate had recently risen.",
        "According to some Council members, the increase in the propensity to save could limit consumption growth in the coming quarters.",
        "Most of these members noted that the rise in the savings rate was a positive development in the Polish economy in longer term, but some of them were of the opinion that it might prove a drag for economic growth in Poland, both in shorter and longer run.",
        "Certain Council members also pointed to a some acceleration in lending to households in the recent months.",
        "The Council members also pointed to an improvement in financial standing of enterprises, in particular to renewed growth in company profits.",
        "Moreover, certain Council members noted that corporate lending had accelerated of late, driven by faster growth in current loans and stable increase in investment loans.",
        "The Council members judged that the financial system in Poland was functioning in a stable manner.",
        "However, they maintained their assessment that a possible currency conversion of some foreign currency loans posed a significant risk to banking sector stability in Poland.",
        "Assessing the outlook for economic growth in the coming quarters, the Council members judged that it should be close to the NBP’s July projection.",
        "At the same time, they underlined that since that projection the risks for economic growth had shifted to the downside, mainly due to recent developments abroad.",
        "The Council members pointed to a risk of more expansionary fiscal policy in the coming quarters that could result from the implementation of the draft budget law for 2016 as well as the election promises.",
        "If effected, fiscal expansion could support economic growth in the coming quarters, but – according to some Council members – might also undermine fiscal stability in the longer run.",
        "Analysing the possible impact of weaker growth outlook in China on economic conditions in Poland, the majority of the Council members judged it should be limited given a small share of this country in Polish exports and the ongoing economic recovery in the euro area.",
        "However, certain Council members were of the opinion that already observed and possible further external shocks might have a strong negative impact on Polish economy.",
        "They argued that the capacity for anti-cyclical economic policy was limited due to substantial – in their assessment – fiscal imbalances and low interest rates.",
        "While discussing price developments in Poland, it was noted that deflation had deepened slightly in September due to further decline in global commodity prices.",
        "Certain Council members also pointed to a sharper fall in producer prices.",
        "Along with slow growth in unit labour costs, this contains a risk of rising cost pressure.",
        "Yet, in the opinion of the Council members, in the coming months inflation should gradually increase.",
        "However, the majority of the Council members emphasized that inflation would probably rise at a somewhat slower pace than expected in the July projection.",
        "They stressed that starting from 2016 Q1, the rise in inflation might come to a halt, and following that, inflation could remain slightly below the lower band for deviations from the target.",
        "However, certain Council members pointed to upside risks to inflation in the coming quarters, resulting from growing tensions in the domestic labour market, relatively high wage increases planned by enterprises and a likely – in their opinion – rise in food prices caused by adverse weather conditions in some parts of the world.",
        "Referring to interest rate decisions, the majority of the Council members were of the opinion that it was justified to keep nominal interest rates at the current levels, as the risks in the environment of the Polish economy were not having a clear impact on economic growth and inflation was expected to rise gradually towards the target.",
        "Some Council members emphasized that stable interest rates support the resilience of the Polish economy to shocks, particularly amidst considerable uncertainty about the global economic outlook.",
        "Certain Council members judged that a further reduction in interest rates would fail to translate into a significant lending growth, at the same time resulting in lower voluntary household savings.",
        "However, certain Council members expressed an opinion that the Council should consider the possibility of a reduction in interest rates in the coming months.",
        "In their view, lower interest rates would support domestic demand and therefore contain the scale of a possible economic slowdown driven by worse economic conditions abroad.",
        "They also argued that monetary policy easing in Poland would reduce the interest rate differentials between Poland and abroad, including the euro area, where monetary conditions might be loosened over a longer period than previously expected.",
        "In turn, according to certain Council members, the Council should consider interest rate increases in the coming months.",
        "These members argued that the interest rate increases are justified by a faster acceleration in price growth than assumed in the July projection expected by them and a high risk of severe external shocks.",
        "In their opinion, interest rate increases would provide more room for monetary policy easing in the event of adverse shocks.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 1.50%, the lombard rate at 2.50%, the deposit rate at 0.50%, the rediscount rate at 1.75%.",
        "Other Council members expressed the opinion that the impact of interest rates on corporate restructuring was limited, and its intensity was determined mainly by institutional factors.",
        "Referring to the situation in the emerging economies, it was pointed out that economic conditions in China continued to deteriorate gradually, and forecasts indicated a further slowdown in GDP growth in 2015.",
        "It was also emphasized that the situation of Poland’s eastern trading partners remained unfavourable, with recession forecasted for Russia and Ukraine in 2015.",
        "Certain Council members pointed to a possible outflow of capital as a risk factor for the emerging economies, especially those experiencing less favourable macroeconomic conditions.",
        "At the meeting attention was drawn to the stabilization of prices in the international commodity markets.",
        "Certain members remarked at that point that oil prices, following a strong decline, had increased slightly since the beginning of the year.",
        "In the recent period, also declines in the prices of agricultural commodities and industrial metals had come to a halt.",
        "This contributed to the weakening of disinflationary forces in many countries, and hence easing of deflation in the euro area and the stabilization of prices in the United States.",
        "The growth of prices in the global markets continued to be very slow, and remained negative in most European Union countries.",
        "With reference to monetary policy in Poland’s external environment it was pointed out that it had recently been eased by many central banks.",
        "The ECB had launched a Treasury bond purchase programme, and conducted another TLTRO operation on a larger-than-expected scale.",
        "It was also emphasized that the Fed had ruled out interest rate hikes in the next two months, while still signalling tightening its monetary policy this year.",
        "When analysing the situation in real economy in Poland, it was pointed out that the incoming data confirmed continued stable growth in economic activity.",
        "Some Council members expressed the view that GDP growth in 2015 Q1 had probably slightly picked up as compared to the previous quarter.",
        "It was estimated that economic activity was fuelled by sustained growth in domestic demand.",
        "In this context, attention was paid to the still sound financial situation of companies – despite some deterioration in 2014 Q4 – and a stable rise in corporate lending, which further boosted corporate investment activity.",
        "Consumer demand continued to be supported by growing real income of households amid rising employment, and a further increase in consumer loans.",
        "Certain Council members pointed out, however, that although the situation in the labour market remained good, both employment and nominal wage growth in the enterprise sector had slowed down.",
        "Other members emphasized that unemployment – despite a gradual decline – stayed relatively high and nominal wages continued to be low as compared to most European countries.",
        "Council members also pointed out that weak growth of foreign demand, notwithstanding its slight acceleration, remained a factor curbing GDP growth in Poland in the first quarter.",
        "While discussing the outlook for economic growth, most members of the Council assessed that GDP growth in the coming quarters would gradually accelerate with consumption and investment remaining its key drivers.",
        "Moreover, along with economic recovery in the euro area GDP growth in Poland would be increasingly supported by rising exports.",
        "Certain members of the Council assessed that GDP growth was likely to be higher than anticipated in the March projection; this might be driven by faster improvement in the labour market, which, together with stronger rebound in economic activity abroad, would be conducive to stronger growth in consumption and private investment.",
        "Some Council members were of the opinion that also the increase in public investment might be higher than projected due to faster absorption of EU funds.",
        "Certain Council members believed, however, that GDP growth in 2015 might be slightly lower than projected, which – in their opinion – could be driven by a slowdown in corporate investment.",
        "According to certain members of the Council, also the positive supply shocks waning faster could lead to GDP growth slower than projected; this would, at the same time, contribute to the build-up of external imbalances.",
        "It was pointed out that GDP growth in the coming quarters might be additionally constrained by an excessive appreciation of the zloty.",
        "Some Council members observed that the impact of the ECB's quantitative easing on the real economy in the euro area and on asset prices within and outside the euro area continues to generate uncertainty about future economic conditions in Poland.",
        "Some Council members pointed out that the assessment of Poland's economic outlook is obscured by the uncertainty related to future geopolitical situation in Ukraine, the timing of the monetary policy tightening by the Fed, and the risk of turmoil related to the situation in Greece.",
        "Certain Council members also considered the current situation to involve a high risk of shocks in the international financial markets as a result of the sustained expansionary monetary policy by major central banks.",
        "Other Council members emphasized the absence of imbalances in the domestic economy, pointing to a stable situation in the real estate market, a relatively low private and public debts, a small deficit on the current account and a safe level of Poland's foreign indebtedness.",
        "Discussing inflation developments in Poland, it was indicated that annual price growth in February had decreased again and was running below expectations.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that while short-term inflation forecasts had been revised downwards, the expected period of deflation had remained unchanged.",
        "Some Council members highlighted that deflation in Poland was mainly driven by external factors, including, in particular, declining prices of energy and food commodities.",
        "As deflation was primarily caused by supply-side factors, in the opinion of those members of the Council, it was boosting households' purchasing power and reducing corporate costs, thus supporting domestic economic growth.",
        "In turn, some Council members were of the opinion that apart from external factors, weak price growth in Poland was underpinned by the absence of demand pressure, as indicated by the negative readings of most core inflation measures and the steady decline in producer prices.",
        "They also emphasized persistently limited wage pressure despite a gradual improvement in the labour market.",
        "Addressing the prospects for inflation, members indicated that both the March projection and short-term forecasts envisaged price growth to remain negative in the following months, albeit the pace of this growth would gradually pick up, to turn positive by the end of the year.",
        "Some Council members represented the opinion that price growth would be higher than indicated in the March projection, and certain members expected inflation to return to the target as early as next year.",
        "It was pointed out that the waning effect of the decline in global commodity prices would contribute to the weakening of deflationary trends.",
        "Certain Council members indicated at this point a possibility of a rise in oil prices this year which might additionally drive up consumer price growth.",
        "Certain Council members voiced the opinion that as supply shocks wore away, the wage pressure might increase, which – according to those Council members – was currently disguised by the rise in the purchasing power of households' disposable income due to a decline in energy and food prices.",
        "The increase in wage pressure and accelerated growth of nominal wages would be supported – in the opinion of those Council members – by the situation in the labour market, which was favouring job seekers, as indicated by the high proportion of vacancies in relation to the number of the unemployed.",
        "Yet, other Council members believed that growth of wages in the coming quarters would be close to that of labour productivity, with wage pressure remaining limited.",
        "Some Council members pointed out that the appreciation of the zloty, especially amidst an extended period of low inflation abroad, might also exert downward pressure on price growth.",
        "Council members drew attention to some appreciation of the exchange rate of the zloty in the past quarter, which was supported by ECB’s quantitative easing.",
        "Some Council members observed that the appreciation of the zloty might constrain the competitiveness of Polish exports.",
        "Council members assessed that price growth in the nearest quarters would remain negative, mainly due to prior sharp price declines in commodity markets.",
        "At the same time, as the effects of those shocks waned, price growth would gradually increase.",
        "This would be additionally supported by both the sustained economic recovery at home and an improvement in economic conditions abroad, which – together with the prior adjustment of monetary policy – would limit the risk of inflation continuing below the target in the medium term.",
        "The Council decided to keep the basic NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 1.50%, the lombard rate at 2.50%, the deposit rate at 0.50% and the rediscount rate at 1.75%.",
        "At the same time, few members of the Council expressed the opinion that the expected acceleration of GDP growth in the United States in 2015 might fail to materialize, as indicated by the slowdown in GDP growth in 2014 Q4.",
        "Members of the Council highlighted the fall in prices of a large group of commodities in the recent period, which – amidst moderate global economic growth – had resulted in a decline in inflation in many countries.",
        "At the same time, it was emphasised that the fall in commodity prices would help to stimulate economic activity in countries that are net commodity importers.",
        "Few Council members pointed out that oil prices had increased somewhat in recent days and noted that the changes in commodity prices were an important source of uncertainty about economic activity and inflation developments in the global economy.",
        "With regard to monetary policy in Poland’s external environment, it was highlighted that – in response to the deepening deflation and persistently slow economic growth in the euro area – the European Central Bank (ECB) had significantly extended its asset purchase programme by adding sovereign bonds.",
        "When discussing the possible effects of the ECB’s quantitative easing, some of the Council members expressed the opinion that its impact on the real economy might be limited.",
        "According to them, an increase in liquid reserves in banks in the euro area might fail to significantly stimulate lending activity, including loans for investment purposes.",
        "They noted that the low growth in corporate lending was related to the continued uncertainty about the future economic situation in the euro area and – therefore – the financing cost had little influence on demand for credit.",
        "This was indicated, according to few Council members, by persistently falling value of corporate loans in the euro area despite decreasing interest rates on corporate loans in recent months.",
        "Some of the Council members assessed that declining yields on debt instruments in the euro area would be the main effect of the ECB’s activities.",
        "Few Council members expressed the opinion that declining yields on assets and interest rates on deposits in the euro area could increase the propensity of some households to save, so that the growth in savings, and thus future consumption, would remain at a constant level, which, consequently, might limit current consumption.",
        "At the same time, some Council members pointed out that the ECB’s quantitative easing might increase the inflow of portfolio capital to non-euro area economies, including Poland, causing exchange rate appreciation pressures.",
        "Council members also discussed the decision of the Swiss National Bank to remove the Swiss franc asymmetric peg against the euro and reduce its interest rates.",
        "In this context, it was pointed out that currently it is not possible to assess in full the consequences of the Swiss franc appreciation for Polish economic agents with francdenominated liabilities, due to the high volatility of the zloty against the franc and the unknown reaction of the banking sector and supervisory and regulatory authorities to this situation.",
        "Few Council members noted, that persisting weak exchange rate of the zloty against the Swiss franc would exacerbate the problems with repayment of the franc-denominated debt and would deteriorate banks’ asset structure.",
        "While discussing the business climate in Poland, Council members pointed out that GDP growth in 2014 Q4 had slowed down slightly, remaining above 3%.",
        "Members of the Council emphasised a higher growth of industrial production, construction and assembly, and retail sales in December, as well as an increase in some business climate indicators and a further improvement in labour market conditions.",
        "Some Council members assessed that despite a slight slowdown, GDP growth was at a level similar to that of the potential output.",
        "Few Council members pointed out that growth in domestic demand in 2014 Q4 – despite the negative contribution of inventories to GDP growth – was above the expectations and higher than the growth of the whole GDP.",
        "In the opinion of these Council members, the continued high growth of domestic demand contributed to the widening of the current account deficit, the size of which is currently lowered by the fall in commodity prices and the related improvement in the terms of trade.",
        "Other Council members assessed, however, that although GDP continued to grow at around 3%, the output gap in Poland remained negative.",
        "While discussing the prospects for economic growth, some Council members emphasised that in the following quarters economic growth in Poland would gradually pick up.",
        "These members argued that a further increase in employment, amidst moderate growth in wages and an improvement in consumer confidence indicators, would be conducive to continued high growth in consumer demand.",
        "According to these Council members, investment demand would, in turn, be supported by a further fast growth in investment expenditure of enterprises, and in the second half of 2015 also by an acceleration in infrastructure investment financed from EU funds.",
        "Few Council members emphasised that the favourable prospects for corporate investment activity were largely the result of a growing propensity of enterprises to invest driven by falling perceived uncertainty in their environment, increasing capacity utilisation and an improvement in the demand forecasts, alongside favourable financing conditions.",
        "Some Council members pointed to the forecasted acceleration in GDP growth in the euro area as an additional source of the economic upturn in Poland.",
        "Other Council members expressed the opinion that even if GDP growth accelerated gradually in the following quarters, it would not lead to a build-up of imbalances in the economy.",
        "Few Council members also pointed to the risk of a slowdown in growth at the end of 2015 and at the beginning of 2016.",
        "It was noted that the rise in consumer demand would be limited by an increase in the Swiss-franc denominated debt of households.",
        "In turn, in the opinion of few Council members, growth in investment outlays of enterprises might be adversely affected by continued uncertainty about demand and their low expected profitability compared to the yields on alternative forms of savings allocation.",
        "Against this background, few Council members pointed to the persistence of the low contribution of investment to GDP growth and the small percentage of enterprises planning to start new investments.",
        "Some Council members were of the opinion that the main source of risk for acceleration of economic activity in Poland was the possibility of lower than expected GDP growth in the euro area.",
        "Few Council members also noted that the possible appreciation of the zloty could adversely affect GDP growth.",
        "While discussing the inflationary processes in Poland, it was pointed out that in January the annual consumer price index had fallen once again and was below the expectations.",
        "At the same time, the short-term inflation forecasts had been significantly revised downwards, and the expected period of deflation had been extended.",
        "In addition, an acceleration in the decline in producer prices was noted.",
        "Some Council members expressed the opinion that the deflation in Poland was mainly driven by external factors, primarily the decline in commodity prices.",
        "They noted that the extension of the expected period of deflation was the result of a downward revision of the forecasted paths for energy and food prices.",
        "In the opinion of these Council members, the deflation – as it was supply driven – would not have adverse economic effects.",
        "On the contrary, it would support GDP growth, by stimulating an increase in the purchasing power of incomes.",
        "Few Council members noted that there are currently no signals indicating a risk of deflationary spiral.",
        "Few Council members also expressed the opinion that the low price growth – amidst moderate economic growth in Poland’s external environment and a fall in commodity prices – was a normal phenomenon, and taking into account the expected persistence of these developments, inflation would most likely remain low also in the long-term.",
        "Some Council members, in turn, were of the opinion that the decline in prices in Poland was not only a result of external factors, but was also due to low demand pressure in the domestic economy.",
        "In their opinion, this was indicated by both the further decline in the majority of core inflation measures and the fact that producer prices had been decreasing for almost three years, thus much longer than the fall in commodity prices in the global markets.",
        "These Council members also emphasised that against the background of a sustained fall in prices, inflation expectations of households and enterprises remained very low, while the expectations of analysts had recently been significantly revised downwards.",
        "Moreover, these Council members were of the opinion that the longer the period of deflation, the higher the risk of its adverse effects for the economy.",
        "Referring to the level of interest rates, some Council members emphasised that although nominal interest rates had been lowered in 2014 Q4, deepening deflation and the strong downward revision of price growth forecasts had led in recent months to an increase in interest rates in real terms, driving them to relatively high levels.",
        "They also pointed to the record low yields on long-term bonds, indicating that in the long-term inflation or the equilibrium real rate would be markedly lower than to date.",
        "However, other Council members noted that nominal rates were at record lows, and real rates would decline along with forecasted rise in price growth.",
        "While discussing the decision on NBP interest rates, the majority of the members of the Council judged that they should remain unchanged at the current meeting.",
        "Some of the Council members pointed out that GDP growth was currently close to that of the potential output and its acceleration was forecasted in the following quarters.",
        "Moreover, these members argued that deflation in Poland was mainly supply driven and – as a consequence – did not have a negative impact on the economy, while the influence of monetary policy on inflation processes was limited.",
        "Few Council members were of the opinion that against the background of sustained high growth in domestic demand, a lowering of interest rates could result in a build-up of external imbalances and lead to excessive growth of credit, including housing credit, and expose the borrowers to significant rise in debt servicing costs in case of interest rates increase.",
        "Excessive credit growth could also create the risk of real estate bubble.",
        "These Council members expressed the opinion that further adjustment of interest rates – while reducing the cost of servicing the public debt only temporarily – could lead to increased instability of public finance in the future.",
        "At the same time, in the opinion of these Council members, maintaining nominal interest rates at low levels has an adverse effect on the process of selection of economic agents and thus limits the productivity growth in the economy.",
        "However, some Council members pointed out that deepening deflation and its longer duration increased the risk of inflation remaining below the target in the medium term and therefore justified interest rate cuts.",
        "In addition, they noted that the risk of negative consequences of deflation for the economy rose along with its duration.",
        "These members judged that the persistence of a significant interest rate differential between Poland and its external environment, amidst a strong easing of monetary policy by the ECB, increased the risks of an inflow of portfolio capital and excessive strengthening of the zloty exchange rate, which would additionally hinder the return of inflation to its target and could weaken GDP growth.",
        "Few members of the Council also emphasised that interest rate cuts – in the absence of inflation risk – would lead to a reduction in public debt servicing costs, and thus support the government’s economic policy.",
        "Moreover, few members noted that the adjustment of interest rates would make the deleveraging of economic agents easier and could also support the process of currency conversion of housing loans.",
        "However, some Council members judged that due to the significant volatility in the financial markets in the recent period, it was justified to leave interest rates unchanged at the current meeting.",
        "Yet, these members did not rule out an adjustment of monetary policy in the nearest future, when evaluation of inflation prospects in the medium-term would be possible, taking into account NBP’s March projection.",
        "Few Council members assessed that despite a significant volatility in the financial markets, the extension of the period of falling prices and the low likelihood of significant GDP growth in the coming quarters, posing the risk of macroeconomic imbalances, justified the lowering of interest rates already at the current meeting.",
        "These members indicated that in view of the above developments, the lack of a decision on easing monetary policy might lead to growing uncertainty in the economy.",
        "At the meeting a motion to cut the NBP interest rates by 0.25 percentage points was submitted.",
        "The Council decided to keep the key interest rates at the following levels: the NBP reference rate at 2.00%, the lombard rate at 3.00%, the deposit rate at 1.00%, the rediscount rate at 2.25%.",
        "at reducing the public debt.",
        "Furthermore, uncertainty surrounding the outlook for euro area growth was emphasised.",
        "A few Council members observed that a recovery in this currency area was delaying, citing the recent downward revisions of GDP growth forecasts for this economy, including those by the European Central Bank.",
        "Yet, other Council members were of the opinion that despite the persistently heightened uncertainty in the euro area, driven, among others, by the nearing elections in Greece, GDP growth should accelerate gradually in the following quarters supported by the considerable decline in oil prices.",
        "Council members also pointed to the halt in economic growth in Russia in 2014 Q4 and the likelihood of a marked GDP decline in this economy in 2015.",
        "On the other hand, a few Council members emphasised that economic activity in many other countries of the Central and Eastern European region remained stable.",
        "Members of the Council highlighted further substantial decline of oil prices observed in the recent period, leading to lower inflation and inflation forecasts in many economies.",
        "It was noted that deflation was observed in the euro area in December and the ECB had markedly revised downward its inflation forecasts for 2015.",
        "It was assessed that under these circumstances the announcement of new quantitative easing programmes by the ECB was likely as early as in January 2015.",
        "Council members also pointed to the likelihood of forthcoming interest rate rise in the United States, which would probably support an inflow of portfolio capital to the US economy.",
        "Heightened risk aversion that had prevailed recently in the financial markets was pointed out.",
        "As expectations of an interest rate rise in the United States had been mounting, the US dollar had gained considerably, while emerging market currencies, including the zloty, had weakened.",
        "Yet, it was emphasised that the decline in the zloty exchange rate vis-à-vis the euro was much smaller than that vis-à-vis the dollar.",
        "A few members of the Council argued that the zloty had weakened partially on the back of the slump of the rouble.",
        "It was further pointed out that the currencies of Poland’s other trading partners had depreciated much more than the zloty.",
        "As a result, the nominal effective exchange rate of the zloty had been stronger in December than in the month before.",
        "While analysing the conditions in the real economy in Poland, Council members assessed that GDP growth could have weakened somewhat in 2014 Q4.",
        "Yet, some Council members were of the opinion that despite this likely slowdown, GDP growth remained stable and forecasts pointed to its gradual rebound in the following quarters.",
        "Against this background, those Council members argued that the observed decline in global oil prices would support domestic demand as well as – through higher GDP growth abroad – Polish exports.",
        "As a result, economic growth in Poland might prove to be stronger than previously forecasted.",
        "Other Council members believed that GDP growth in the second half of 2015 would be propped up by higher inflow of European Union funds.",
        "Pointing to the relatively strong outlook for demand in the Polish economy, a few Council members observed that the financial situation of enterprises continued to be sound, fuelled by low oil prices.",
        "Investment kept on rising at a robust pace, supported by low credit cost, while forecasts of orders and production were above their long-term average.",
        "They also argued that corporate lending was rising, and money supply in the real terms expanded at the highest pace since the onset of the global financial crisis.",
        "They also assessed that corporate business climate indicators had stabilised and that household sentiment was improving.",
        "However, some Council members pointed out that the pace of GDP growth did not ensure fast closure of the output gap and there were no signs of a marked pick-up in the economic activity in the following quarters.",
        "A few Council members emphasised the risk of a substantial slowdown in GDP growth.",
        "In this context, it was argued that industrial production growth had decreased close to zero in November, while construction and assembly output had continued to contract and retail sales growth had weakened.",
        "Some Council members pointed out that domestic economic conditions were being adversely affected by the delay of recovery in the euro area and by the slump in activity in Russia.",
        "It was emphasised that a further tightening of the macroprudential policy at the beginning of this year would probably limit mortgage lending growth.",
        "A few Council members also drew attention to the fact that in recent quarters, domestic demand had been supported by a considerable rise in inventories, which could have resulted from shortage of demand for already produced goods.",
        "This could result in lower production growth in the future.",
        "While analysing labour market conditions, sustained corporate employment growth was highlighted, as well as the declining seasonally adjusted unemployment rate.",
        "A few Council members also pointed to business climate surveys suggesting further growth in corporate employment.",
        "At the same time it was pointed out that no signs of wage pressure had been observed in the corporate sector, and that wage growth in the government sector was being curbed by the wage fund freeze in this sector.",
        "When discussing inflationary processes in Poland, Council members pointed to the possibility of deflation continuing longer than previously expected.",
        "It was also emphasized that price growth forecasts for the following quarters had been revised downwards in the recent period.",
        "As a result, deflation might persist for another few months, and the horizon of inflation returning to the NBP inflation target might get longer.",
        "Some members of the Council emphasized, however, that deflation was primarily due to lower prices of commodities.",
        "Those members assessed that for this reason deflation was conducive for domestic demand growth, as it supported wage growth in real terms and increased the ability of economic agents to service debt, thus supporting the economic upturn.",
        "They pointed to the fact that the decline in energy prices boosted the sentiment of most economic agents.",
        "A few members of the Council emphasized that an extended period of slow price growth was currently a feature of many economies.",
        "Some members of the Council highlighted, however, that the observed decline in prices was not only driven by falling commodity prices, but also by negative output gap in the economy.",
        "In their opinion, this was reflected by the lowest in history and negative average of core inflation measures as well as the continued negative growth rate of producer prices.",
        "Those members of the Council also indicated that most retail sales deflators were negative, and the growth of prices of services – which were most responsive to domestic demand pressure – had followed a downward trend for many quarters.",
        "It was pointed out that deflation led to expectations of households and enterprises running consistently at very low levels, and that inflation expectations of analysts for the following two years were below the inflation target.",
        "While discussing the NBP interest rates, the majority of the members of the Council judged that they should remain unchanged at the current meeting.",
        "The majority of the members of the Council expressed the opinion that leaving interest rates unchanged at the current meeting was justified by the heightened risk aversion in the international financial markets, resulting, inter alia, from the foreign exchange crisis in Russia.",
        "Some members of the Council who were in favour of keeping the interest rates unchanged pointed out that the prolonged deflation resulted from supply shocks, hence was beyond the direct impact of the domestic monetary policy.",
        "It was also pointed out that the observed decline in commodity prices supported economic activity.",
        "A few Council members assessed that a further reduction in interest rates – amidst domestic demand growth exceeding, in their opinion, potential GDP growth – could lead to excessive lending growth and an increase in the current account deficit, which was currently curbed by a significant drop in import prices.",
        "They also argued that a possible increase in interest rates abroad might worsen the income balance on the current account.",
        "Those members of the Council also pointed out that currently the NBP interest rates were at historically low levels, and their further lowering would inhibit corporate restructuring and curb potential economic growth.",
        "Some of the members of the Council observed that slow price growth was typical for many economies, and the experience of other central banks showed that under the current conditions interest rate cuts might fail to bring inflation to the target.",
        "Some members of the Council also judged that the expected acceleration in the growth of prices would bring about a decline in real interest rates.",
        "Yet, some Council members assessed that it might be justified to adjust the NBP interest rates in the coming months.",
        "Those members emphasized that the period of deflation and the time horizon of inflation returning to the target were extending.",
        "They also assessed that the incoming data pointed to a risk of a slowdown in economic activity, and sluggish economic growth persisted in the external environment of the Polish economy.",
        "They indicated that continuing deflation boosted real interest rates, which were now relatively high in Poland both in historical terms and when compared with other economies.",
        "The possibility of the ECB’s further easing of its monetary policy was also emphasized.",
        "A few of those members of the Council also pointed out that interest rates on loans to the private sector were higher than the nominal GDP growth.",
        "In real terms they were higher than the profitability of enterprises, and so – in the opinion of those Council members – did not pose a risk of excessive debt growth nor inhibit corporate restructuring.",
        "Those members also pointed out that due to the limited array of monetary policy tools, corporate restructuring should be supported primarily by structural policy.",
        "A few members of the Council who did not rule out an adjustment of interest rates in the coming months, underlined that the potential need to adjust monetary policy could be assessed better after the possible measures of the ECB had been evaluated and the new projection of inflation and GDP had been released.",
        "A few Council members assessed that due to the continuing decline in prices, extended period of inflation returning to the target as well as the risk of a slowdown in GDP growth in the coming quarters, interest rates should be cut already at the current meeting.",
        "In their view, lower NBP interest rates would not only boost economic activity, but also – in the absence of inflationary threats – would help to reduce the cost of public debt servicing, which would support the government's economic policy.",
        "Given these arguments, a few of those members of the Council were in favour of a considerable cut in interest rates.",
        "At the meeting a motion to cut the NBP interest rates by 1.00 percentage point was submitted.",
        "A motion to lower the NBP interest rates by 0.25 percentage points was submitted.",
        "The Council decided to keep the key interest rates at the following levels: the NBP reference rate at 2.00%, the lombard rate at 3.00%, the deposit rate at 1.00%, the rediscount rate at 2.25%.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that should Greece’s negotiations with its creditors fail, this might hurt sentiment and economic activity in the euro area and worldwide.",
        "Certain Council members believed that the impact of a Greek default would probably be weaker now than if it had happened in the previous years.",
        "Some Council members also highlighted the continued weakness of business activity in the largest emerging economies as a considerable risk to global economic growth.",
        "It was argued that the relatively subdued output growth in these economies was dragging on export growth in the developed countries, including Germany.",
        "Particular attention was paid to the weaker than in the previous years economic activity in China and the effects of excessive investment in the real estate market in this country.",
        "In this context, certain Council members considered that the developments in China – as well as the sentiment in the global financial markets – might also suffer from the slump in share prices on stock exchanges in this country.",
        "With regard to global inflation developments, the Council pointed to the recent pick up in price growth in many economies.",
        "It was emphasized, however, that amidst the merely modest global economic recovery and the persistence of relatively low commodity prices, inflation pressure in the global economy remained very weak, with price growth in the euro area, the United States, and – on average – the countries of Central and Eastern Europe hovering barely above zero.",
        "While analysing the situation in the global commodity markets, it was observed that oil prices had edged down recently.",
        "In turn, agricultural commodity prices had risen sharply on the back of concerns about poor harvest due to unfavourable weather conditions.",
        "When discussing monetary policy in Poland’s external environment, it was pointed out that the main central banks were keeping interest rates close to zero.",
        "At the same time, while the ECB had announced the continuation of asset purchases until at least September 2016, the Fed had signalled the commencement of interest rate hikes as early as this year.",
        "Certain Council members emphasised, moreover, that some central banks in Poland’s most immediate environment, i.e.",
        "in Sweden, Norway and Hungary, had eased their monetary policy in the recent period, as well as banks of the largest emerging economies – India, Russia and China.",
        "While analyzing the situation in the real sphere of the Polish economy, some members expressed the opinion that GDP growth in 2015 Q2 might have continued close to the previous quarter’s level.",
        "Members of the Council assessed that consumption, fuelled by further increase in real income of households and their positive sentiment, was likely to have remained the key driving force behind growth in economic activity.",
        "It was pointed out that growth in economic activity in 2015 Q2 was also supported by a further rise in investment.",
        "It was argued that corporate investment activity was driven by good financial conditions of corporations, enabling them to finance investment projects with their own funds.",
        "At the same time, some Council members pointed to a slowdown in both industrial production at the beginning of 2015 Q2 and sales in construction and assembly production in May 2015, as well as a merely moderate increase in retail sales.",
        "Certain Council members assessed that this might indicate a stabilization of economic growth in the coming quarters at the level close to that in 2015 Q1, or even its slight weakening.",
        "In the opinion of the Council members situation in the labour market remained good.",
        "In particular, employment continued to rise and unemployment was still falling.",
        "Some members of the Council emphasized, however, that employment growth in the enterprise sector had levelled off, while the nominal wage growth in the sector had slowed down in the recent period.",
        "Nevertheless, certain Council members pointed that the real wage growth remained high and exceeded labour productivity growth.",
        "In the opinion of those members this situation, if continued – as indicated in the July projection – might bring about adverse structural changes in the economy; in particular, it might inhibit further increase of the share of industry in value added.",
        "Other Council members were of the opinion that the relatively rapid growth in real wages was justified given a relatively modest ratio of wages to GDP in Poland.",
        "Those members were of the opinion that high real wage growth did not necessarily have a negative impact on the economy, as labour productivity would increase with growing technological advancement and innovation.",
        "While analyzing the situation in the financial sphere of the Polish economy, members of the Council remarked that the increase in lending to the private sector had slowed down somewhat in the recent period.",
        "It was pointed out that the rise in current account deposits was accompanied by a decline in term deposits.",
        "At the same time, growth of cash in circulation picked up.",
        "Certain members of the Council assessed that sustained high growth in mortgage lending in PLN, combined with a rising share of households whose income net of interest payment had fallen below the subsistence level, might be a source of risk to financial stability.",
        "Those members also expressed the opinion that the rising percentage of companies unable to cover interest expenses out of their profits was a negative phenomenon.",
        "Yet, the majority of Council members concluded that the financial sector showed no sign of imbalances or any tangible risk of their occurrence in the future.",
        "Some of those members of the Council emphasized that the growth of housing loans in transaction terms, had fallen to its lowest level in more than a decade.",
        "They also pointed out that the risk of excessive growth in housing loans in the future would be limited by the steady tightening of macro-prudential policy as the ceiling on the LtV ratio was progressively reduced.",
        "Referring to the ability of enterprises to repay their loan obligations, those members pointed out that the share of loans with payment delays was not increasing and remained at a moderate level.",
        "When discussing the outlook for economic growth in the context of the July projection, it was indicated that GDP growth would be relatively stable at close to 3.5% over the whole projection horizon.",
        "Certain members of the Council pointed out that the central path of the July projection was slightly above that of the March projection.",
        "According to the current projection, economic growth throughout the projection horizon would be primarily supported by rising consumption, as well as the still relatively high – despite a certain weakening in the second half of 2016 – investment growth.",
        "Some Council members emphasized that given the projected GDP growth, the output gap would close in 2015 and would remain near zero in the subsequent years.",
        "In the opinion of certain members of the Council, economic growth may, however, be stronger than indicated by the central projection path.",
        "According to these Council members, higher GDP growth may result from a slightly weaker exchange rate of the zloty than that accounted for in the projection.",
        "In this context, the above Council members indicated that the political risk related to the parliamentary elections and also the beginning of interest rate increases by the Fed might lead towards depreciation of the zloty.",
        "In turn, some Council members highlighted downside risks to the forecasted path of economic growth.",
        "In particular, it was pointed out that Greece’s possible default and its exit from the euro area might enhance risk aversion in the financial markets.",
        "This in turn, according to these Council members, could result in a rise in debt servicing costs, an outflow of portfolio capital from Poland and a depreciation of the zloty, which would increase the charges on economic entities resulting from foreign currency denominated loans.",
        "Unfavourable developments in Greece could also weigh down on business conditions in the euro area, which in turn would have an adverse impact on economic activity in Poland.",
        "However, the majority of Council members were of the opinion that the impact of turmoil related to the situation in Greece on the Polish economy would probably be limited.",
        "Some Council members pointed to the shape of fiscal policy next year as a factor of uncertainty.",
        "These Council members emphasized that there was a risk of fiscal policy easing, particularly as the excessive deficit procedure against Poland had been lifted.",
        "Discussing inflation developments in the economy, the Council members drew attention to the gradual increase in price growth.",
        "However, some Council members stressed that the weakening of deflation resulted exclusively from the increased growth of food and energy prices.",
        "At the same time, the majority of Council members assessed that given the moderate growth in demand and nominal wages as well as the persistently negative output gap, there was no inflationary pressure in the economy.",
        "In the opinion of these Council members, this was indicated by the still very low core inflation and continued decline in producer prices in annual terms.",
        "The Council members also drew attention to inflationary expectations remaining at a very low level.",
        "Addressing the outlook for inflation, it was emphasized that in accordance with the July projection, assuming unchanged interest rates, price growth in 2015 Q4 would increase above zero and in the coming years would gradually move towards the inflation target.",
        "However, certain Council members were of opinion that price growth might be lower than indicated by the central projection path.",
        "In turn, other Council members assessed that price growth would be higher than indicated in the July projection, which could be caused by a weaker exchange rate of the zloty than that accounted for in the projection as well as a higher than assumed growth in food and energy prices.",
        "Referring to the decision on interest rates, the majority of Council members acknowledged that in the coming years inflation was likely to gradually rise towards the target, but there was no risk of exceeding the target in the medium term.",
        "At the same time, the projection and external forecasts indicate that economic growth in the coming years would be around potential and should not lead to imbalances in the economy.",
        "Moreover, favourable conditions in the labour market continue, yet not entailing growth in wage pressure.",
        "In such a situation, and also taking into account that real interest rates will decline along with the forecasted increase in price growth, it is justified to stabilise nominal interest rates at the present level.",
        "Certain Council members pointed out, however, that with nominal interest rates unchanged amidst gradually accelerating price growth, real interest rates might approach zero next year.",
        "Moreover, these Council members expressed the opinion that weak growth in food and energy prices was concealing wage pressure in the economy and increasing the current account balance.",
        "As a result, with shocks leading to low food and commodity prices waning, macroeconomic imbalances could build up in the economy.",
        "For these reasons, it may be justified – in their opinion – to consider in the coming quarters an increase in interest rates.",
        "Yet, other Council members indicated that currently it was difficult to determine the direction of future interest rate decisions, particularly taking into account the uncertainty of the situation in Poland’s external environment and its impact on the Polish economy.",
        "The Council decided to keep the basic NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 1.50%, the lombard rate at 2.50%, the deposit rate at 0.50% and the rediscount rate at 1.75%.",
        "at that time, including the euro area.",
        "They also noted that in case of the countries of significant interest rates spread to the euro area, the risk of portfolio capital inflows and an appreciation of their currencies had increased due to the ECB’s quantitative easing.",
        "Few Council members underlined that the additional liquidity from quantitative easing programmes in the United States and Great Britain, had been passed onto the real economy only to a limited extent.",
        "Therefore, in their opinion, the programmes had failed to stimulate economic activity.",
        "According to these Council members, quantitative easing in the United States had distorted asset prices, and thus resulted in re-emergence of imbalances in this economy.",
        "They indicated that despite quantitative easing programmes, the recovery of the US economy, though faster than in the euro area, was still the slowest since the World War II.",
        "They pointed out that it was greater flexibility of the US and British economies that contributed to the relatively fast recovery in these countries following the global financial crisis.",
        "With reference to monetary policy in other economies, some Council members pointed out that it had recently been eased in many economies, particularly in Europe.",
        "They also noted that the Fed had been indicating that it might not start to tighten its monetary policy soon, as inflation had fallen, there was no wage pressure in the economy and the US dollar had strengthened.",
        "While discussing inflationary developments abroad, it was highlighted that the price growth had fallen in many countries over the recent months, and it was negative in the majority of European Union member states.",
        "Few Council members were of the opinion that the fall in oil prices could have come to an end.",
        "At the same time, the majority of Council members assessed that oil prices would remain markedly lower than in previous years.",
        "Moreover, due to the structural changes in oil supply, the upward pressure on its price will likely remain low.",
        "The Council members also noted that prices of many nonenergy commodities, particularly agricultural commodities, had continued to fall.",
        "While discussing the business climate in Poland, it was pointed out that GDP growth in 2014 Q4 had decelerated slightly, but remained above 3%.",
        "It was highlighted, that GDP growth in 2014 Q4 had been still supported mainly by domestic demand, as consumption growth had been stable while investment growth in spite of a slight deceleration, had been high.",
        "However, some Council members stressed that the uncertainty about demand prospects prevailed, particularly in relation to external demand.",
        "These members also highlighted that data on the economic activity in January and the indicators of economic conditions in February had been mixed.",
        "It was pointed out that industrial production and retail sales growth had slowed down in January.",
        "At the same time, in February, indices of sentiment in industry were above expectations and suggested a pick-up in activity and an increase in employment in this sector.",
        "Some Council members also noted that the NBP business climate surveys were indicating a favourable outlook for corporate investment, demand and employment.",
        "They pointed to sound financial position of the enterprise sector, which had been allowing enterprises to finance their investments with their own funds.",
        "In the opinion of few Council members, reliance on own funds in investment financing could lead to some decline in lending to enterprises in early 2015, despite easier corporate lending conditions.",
        "In the assessment of some Council members, the fall in oil prices in the previous months could have improved the financial position of enterprises.",
        "In addition, they pointed out that the fall in oil prices had supported real disposable personal income and private consumption, in addition to further improvement in the labour market conditions, including continued growth in employment.",
        "Few Council members indicated that the improvement in the outlook for household finances also had been translating into ongoing recovery in the housing market in Poland and, consequently, an increase in activity in the housing construction sector.",
        "Few Council members assessed, however, that domestic demand growth caused by an improvement in terms of trade related to the fall in oil prices might lead to greater external imbalances if oil prices increase.",
        "Discussing the economic growth outlook in the context of the March projection, it was noted that in line with the projection GDP growth was to remain stable in the following quarters, increasing slightly, while in the whole projection horizon it should run between 3 and 4%.",
        "Stable GDP growth should result – in light of the projection – from stable increase in consumption and investment growth staying high, despite some weakening in 2016.",
        "In the opinion of few Council members, investment growth could, however, be lower than the central projection path due to weak industrial production growth in recent months and uncertainty about the economic outlook abroad.",
        "The lower than expected investment growth could, in turn, translate into weaker than currently expected GDP growth in the coming quarters or even further economic slowdown.",
        "However, other Council members stressed that the March GDP projection was slightly higher than the November projection.",
        "They assessed that investment growth could be faster than the central projection path due to more efficient absorption of EU funds than assumed in the projection.",
        "Discussing inflationary developments in Poland, it was highlighted that in January annual growth in consumer prices had fallen again.",
        "Some Council members expressed an opinion that deflation in Poland was mainly driven by external factors, including, above all, the fall in commodity prices.",
        "Therefore, deflation will not have negative economic consequences, but rather will support GDP growth, as it will improve the purchasing power of households and financial position of enterprises.",
        "At the same time, some Council members were of the opinion that low price growth in Poland resulted not only from external factors, but also from subdued domestic demand pressure, as indicated by a negative level of most core inflation measures, an extended period of a fall in producer prices and a negative GDP deflator in 2014 Q4.",
        "Discussing the outlook for inflation, it was stressed that according to the March projection, under an assumption of constant interest rates, CPI inflation – despite steady increase in the following quarters – would not return to the target over the projection horizon.",
        "Similarly, core inflation, net of food and energy prices, was forecasted to run below the inflation target at the end of the projection horizon.",
        "In addition, some Council members pointed out that the output gap would most likely remain negative over the projection horizon.",
        "The Council members also noted that the March projection indicated no wage pressure, as labour productivity was expected to increase faster than wages.",
        "However, few Council members indicated that falling prices in the global commodity markets could temporarily mask the wage pressure, as they increased real wage growth and disposable household income.",
        "In their opinion, a steady increase in the relation of job vacancies to the number of the unemployed shows that nominal wages may accelerate when the impact of falling oil prices fades out.",
        "Referring to the level of interest rates in Poland, some Council members emphasised that deepening deflation and further downward revisions of price growth had resulted in an increase in real interest rates.",
        "Few of them pointed out that the high level of real interest rates could contain investment projects in the real economy due to a lower rate of return compared to capital investments.",
        "Other Council members emphasised that in connection with the real convergence of the Polish economy with the euro area, the level of interest rate consistent with the macroeconomic equilibrium in Poland had most likely declined over the recent years.",
        "However, few Council members indicated that the level of real interest rates in the economy was consistent with the current pace of economic growth and macroeconomic equilibrium, helping to prevent external imbalances and excessive credit growth, or might be even too low for current conditions.",
        "In the assessment of few Council members, the level of real and nominal interest rates could be too low also according to the March projection of GDP and inflation, which indicates that the current account deficit should grow under an assumption of constant interest rates.",
        "Moreover, these members stressed that nominal rates in Poland were at historical lows, also compared to the advanced economies before the global financial crisis.",
        "They also emphasised that the real interest rates would decline as the price growth resumes to increase in accordance with the projection.",
        "Discussing the decision on NBP interest rates, the majority of the Council members judged that they should be lowered at the current meeting.",
        "They pointed out that since the previous meeting, volatility in the financial markets, including the currency markets, had diminished.",
        "They underlined that the results of the March projections of inflation and GDP confirmed the assessment that the level of interest rates was too high to support a return of inflation to the target in the following years.",
        "They pointed out that in the light of the March projection, assuming that interest rates remained unchanged, inflation would not return to the target, while the output gap would remain negative over the projection horizon.",
        "They also pointed to the growth in interest rate spread in relation to Poland’s immediate environment, which could be conducive to an increase in foreign capital inflows and an appreciation of the zloty.",
        "This would amplify deflation and delay the return of inflation to the target.",
        "Few Council members underlined that the interest rate cut would also reduce costs of public debt service, thus supporting the government’s economic policy.",
        "While discussing the scale of interest rate reduction and their desired level in the current cycle, the majority of Council members judged that interest rates should be adjusted on a single occasion so that the scale of the reduction would be significant and enough to contain the uncertainty about future monetary policy.",
        "These members were also of the opinion that a significant one-off reduction in interest rates should come along with an announcement that this decision concluded the monetary policy easing cycle.",
        "The majority of Council members judged that such an announcement would not prevent an adjustment in interest rates in an event of unexpected strong shocks in the Polish economy or its environment.",
        "In turn, some Council members were of the opinion that interest rates should remain unchanged.",
        "These members argued that deflation in Poland resulted mainly from supply factors and, consequently, did not impair the economy, while monetary policy currently had a limited impact on inflationary processes.",
        "They pointed out that according to the March projection, a reduction in interest rates in the first half of 2015, in line with the market expectations, would not result in such an increase in inflation that would be sufficient to ensure its return to the target.",
        "At the same time, according to the March projection, a reduction in interest rates could widen external imbalances.",
        "In addition, in the opinion of Council members who were in favour of keeping the monetary policy parameters unchanged, a reduction in interest rates could lead to an increase in financing of unprofitable investments.",
        "In such an event, a relatively high percentage of non-performing loans in Poland could lead to a deterioration in the financial situation of the banking sector.",
        "At the meeting a motion to cut NBP interest rates by 0.50 percentage points was submitted.",
        "A motion was also submitted to reduce NBP interest rates by 0.25 percentage points.",
        "This motion was not voted on due to the adoption of the motion to reduce NBP interest rates by 0.50 percentage points.",
        "The Council decided to reduce the key NBP interest rates by 0.50 percentage points to the following levels: the NBP reference rate to 1.50%, the lombard rate to 2.50%, the deposit rate to 0.50%, the rediscount rate to 1.75%.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that the decline in fuel prices, though sharper than in the euro area, had failed to stimulate consumer spending, yet had increased the savings rate.",
        "It was underlined that the slowdown in economic activity continued in early 2015 Q2.",
        "In addition, it was highlighted that the recent weaker data releases on the economic activity in the United States resulted in a setback in market expectations for the fed funds rate increase.",
        "Certain Council members were of the opinion that the global imbalances, in particular excessive savings in some large economies, remained a drag on global and emerging market economic activity.",
        "They emphasized that global economic activity could be disrupted by the difficulty to stimulate consumer demand in economies with high savings rates.",
        "Evaluating the financial market developments abroad, the Council members pointed to a recent rise in sovereign bond yields in many advanced economies, including the euro area member states.",
        "The rise occurred despite the EBC’s public sector purchase programme.",
        "It was assessed that uncertainty about the measures taken to overcome Greece's sovereign debt crisis could have been a driver of both the increase in risk aversion in the financial markets and the rise in price volatility of many financial assets.",
        "Some Council members also pointed to a recent increase in the prices in the global commodity markets, primarily for crude oil.",
        "Analysing the domestic real economic conditions and the economic outlook, the Council members stressed that the Polish economy had continued to recover in 2015 Q1.",
        "It was also emphasized that GDP growth in 2015 Q1 had been higher than expected.",
        "It was pointed out that although domestic demand growth had ebbed somewhat, this was primarily due to a fall in inventories.",
        "It was also emphasized that household consumption had been rising and investment growth – despite a high statistical base – had also picked up.",
        "In addition, the Council members pointed out that net exports, supported by a gradual recovery in the euro area, contributed positively to the GDP growth rate in 2015 Q1.",
        "Some Council members indicated that Polish foreign trade had been in surplus for two years, and more recently a surplus was recorded also in the current account.",
        "Certain Council members expressed an opinion that these figures showed that competitiveness of the Polish economy was improving and that there were no significant threats to Poland’s external balance.",
        "The Council members assessed that household consumption in Poland was supported by the ongoing improvement in the labour market conditions.",
        "They emphasized that unemployment had fallen and highlighted that the number of the employed had reached historical highs.",
        "Some Council members assessed that, although employment had continued to rise, no wage pressure had been observed in the economy thus far, as the growth rate in unit labour costs had been stable.",
        "In this context, it was cited from the NBP business survey results that according to the survey participants there was no risk of a considerable acceleration in wage growth in the enterprise sector in the near future.",
        "Certain Council members argued that the room for wage increases in the enterprise sector was limited, given that the rise in employment was accompanied by a relatively small pace of increase in production and hence labour productivity.",
        "Certain Council members indicated, however, that in their opinion the unemployment rate was currently already below the equilibrium unemployment rate, which might be conducive to a rise in wage growth in the future.",
        "Other Council members expressed an opinion that the wage level in Poland was low.",
        "According to these members, faster productivity growth could lead to higher wages in Poland provided that it was brought about by more innovation in the Polish economy.",
        "Referring to investment, attention was paid to an increase in the share of enterprises intending to launch new investment projects, as well as to a further recovery in construction.",
        "The Council members also argued that investment growth was supported by a very good financial position of enterprises and relatively high capacity utilization.",
        "Certain Council members assessed that corporate profits were supported by a fall in producer prices, as it reduced production costs more than revenues.",
        "Certain Council members, however, judged that financial costs and revenues had been playing a significant role in shaping corporate profits.",
        "They argued that higher consumer demand could result in a lower share of financial revenues in total revenues of enterprises, as it would increase the relative profitability of sales compared to the profitability of financial operations.",
        "Certain Council members noted that the investment growth rate had been exceeding that of the production.",
        "They assessed that therefore investment growth could slow down in the coming quarters, regardless of the expected increase in investments financed with EU funds.",
        "The Council members highlighted that despite the favourable GDP data for 2015 Q1, economic activity growth could ease somewhat in early 2015 Q2, as indicated by a deceleration in industrial production and retail sales, and a decline in certain economic indicators.",
        "Some Council members emphasized that although the source of this slowdown was difficult to identify and the degree of its persistence hard to assess at the time of the meeting, it would most likely prove temporary.",
        "Certain Council members were of the opinion that ongoing growth in the real disposable personal income would support economic recovery.",
        "Some Council members judged that fiscal policy could be eased in the following year.",
        "Certain Council members indicated that wages in the general government sector might be unfrozen, and that public spending on benefits and allowances was likely to be increased.",
        "The risk of easier fiscal policy was – according to certain Council members – associated with the expected abrogation of the excessive deficit procedure against Poland, which would make more room for larger public spending.",
        "Other members argued, however, that the general government deficit might increase in an event of a slowdown in output due to fluctuations in the business cycle.",
        "Analysing the situation in the financial sector in Poland, some Council members indicated that lending to the private sector continued to grow steadily, which supported economic growth but did not pose a threat to financial stability.",
        "They emphasized that decreases in the NBP interest rates had contributed to a significant decline in interest rates on loans to households and enterprises.",
        "In this context, some Council members marked that there were currently no signs of imbalances in the housing market and that the risk of excessive growth in mortgage loans was limited by macroprudential policy tightening through lowering the maximum loan-to-value ratio.",
        "Certain Council members emphasized, however, that in recent years, despite decreases in the NBP interest rates, lending growth in the economy slowed down somewhat.",
        "They assessed that the interest rates on corporate loans declined in recent months less than the NBP interest rates.",
        "These members also pointed to a slower deposit growth in the banking sector and a likely acceleration in the pace of growth in the ratio of impaired loans for currency loans in an event of depreciation of the zloty.",
        "Other Council members assessed, however, that the value of the foreign currency loans in relation to GDP was low in Poland.",
        "Discussing inflation developments in the economy, the Council members emphasized that the consumer price growth had increased in recent months.",
        "It was pointed out that deflation had eased primarily due to a rise in food and energy prices.",
        "The Council members pointed out that forecasts suggested further price growth.",
        "Yet, most Council members assessed that inflation would return to the target only gradually as producer prices had been declining for many quarters and inflation expectations of households and enterprises were very low.",
        "They also assessed that the output gap in the economy had been negative, which had been translating into very low or even – in most cases – negative core inflation measures.",
        "Certain Council members highlighted that inflation would be returning to the target very slowly also due to still low price growth in the environment of the Polish economy.",
        "Other Council members judged, however, that due to a marked recovery in demand, inflation might increase faster than expected in the latest NBP projection.",
        "The Council members assessed that in the coming months, the annual price growth would remain negative, mainly due to the earlier sharp fall in commodity prices.",
        "At the same time, the expected gradual acceleration in economic growth, amidst recovery in the euro area and good domestic labour market conditions, reduced the risk of inflation remaining below target in the medium term.",
        "Therefore, the Council decided to keep NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 1.50%, the lombard rate at 2.50%, the deposit rate at 0.50% and the rediscount rate at 1.75%.",
        "At the same time, certain Council members emphasised that GDP growth in 2015 Q2 had slowed down somewhat and incoming data for 2015 Q3 did not clearly indicate an acceleration of economic activity.",
        "In turn, it was stressed that with the launch of the third assistance programme for Greece, the risk of a Greek default in the near term had receded and thereby the short-term risk of negative effects of the situation in Greece on the euro area economy had been reduced.",
        "Some of the Council members also drew attention to the favourable information on the economic situation in the United States, including data on GDP growth in 2015 Q2 and the good labour market situation.",
        "An important issue regarding the situation abroad highlighted by Council members was the further weakening of the economic activity in the major emerging economies and related deterioration of global growth prospects.",
        "In this context, Council members pointed to the deepening recession in Russia and Brazil.",
        "However, it was noted that the main risk factor for global growth was the possibility of a stronger than expected slowdown in China.",
        "It was argued that a further weakening of economic activity in China could limit Chinese demand for products from other countries and reduce global economic growth.",
        "Some Council members were of the opinion that the impact of the slowdown in China on the global economy would be amplified by potentially accompanying deceleration in other Asian economies’ growth.",
        "It was pointed out that slowdown in China could influence Polish economy mainly through possible fall in German exports and GDP growth, which would adversely affect Polish exports growth.",
        "However, certain Council members assessed that in view of China’s limited share in German exports, the slowdown in China would have little impact on German GDP growth, and consequently, on the economic situation in Poland.",
        "Certain Council members also considered that in the longer term there could be – particularly amidst rising real wages – change in the structure of demand growth in China in favour of an increased share of consumer demand in GDP, which would support growth in exports from developed economies to China.",
        "Council members emphasised that the deteriorating economic situation in China and other developing economies also caused a reduction in their demand for commodities.",
        "It was considered to be a significant factor driving a renewed decline in prices on global commodity markets in the recent period.",
        "It was noted that in the case of some commodities, the fall in price was also supported by rising supply.",
        "It was emphasised that even the negative supply shock related to the drought in certain countries had not stopped the fall in agricultural commodity prices.",
        "Certain Council members considered that commodity prices were most likely in a long-term downward trend, which might contribute towards an extended period of very low growth in global prices.",
        "Regarding global price developments, it was pointed out that global inflation remains very low.",
        "Some Council members emphasised that the renewed fall in commodity prices and the weakening of the yuan and other currencies of emerging countries would be conducive to global inflation remaining low in the coming quarters.",
        "While discussing monetary policy in Poland’s external environment, it was pointed out that there was continued uncertainty regarding the timing of the beginning of interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve.",
        "In turn, the ECB continued its asset purchase programme and there were some signals indicating a possibility of the programme expansion or extension.",
        "It was also pointed out that the People’s Bank of China had eased monetary policy, including a devaluation of the yuan.",
        "Certain Council members highlighted the fact that in the recent period the Bank of Hungary and Riksbank had once again eased monetary policy.",
        "While discussing the situation in the global financial markets, it was pointed out that many asset prices had fallen and that their volatility had increased in the recent period.",
        "Indications of a stronger economic slowdown in China and the sharp fall of share prices in that country were significant factors leading to deteriorating financial market sentiment.",
        "This deterioration together with devaluation of the yuan also resulted in a weakening of the currencies of many emerging economies.",
        "Certain Council members drew attention to the fact that the upcoming monetary policy tightening by the Fed could increase depreciation pressure on emerging countries’ currencies, which, in economies with significant foreign currency denominated corporate debt, would increase the risk of currency crises.",
        "As a result, there could be a further deterioration in investors sentiment towards emerging markets.",
        "These members pointed out that an additional source of shocks in international financial markets could be the bursting of bubbles in other asset markets, whose formation had been driven – in their opinion – by the unconventional policies of central banks.",
        "In this context, they also underlined that due to the strong economic and financial ties, the occurrence of one shock in the external environment of Poland would increase the likelihood of other risk factors materialising.",
        "As a result, any possible shocks could have a major adverse impact on the situation in the global economy, including economic activity in the euro area.",
        "While analysing the situation in Poland’s real economy, the slight weakening of GDP growth in 2015 Q2 was pointed out.",
        "It was emphasised that while consumption growth was stable, investment had lost momentum and the contribution of net exports to GDP growth had fallen.",
        "However, certain Council members believed that GDP growth was still faster than the growth of potential output.",
        "Some Council members drew attention to the lower than expected growth in output and retail sales in July as well as the fall in the PMI in August, which could signal weakening growth in activity.",
        "It was also pointed out that economic situation in certain sectors in 2015 Q3 might be adversely affected by drought and the temporary restrictions on electricity supply.",
        "Some Council members pointed out that the slight slowdown in GDP growth was accompanied by a somewhat slower growth in wages and the number of working persons in the economy.",
        "Despite this, Council members were of the opinion that the situation in the domestic labour market remained good, resulting in continued robust growth in real wages, a declining unemployment rate and the growing likelihood of finding a job.",
        "While discussing the outlook for economic growth, the majority of Council members emphasised that in the coming quarters GDP growth would most likely continue at a rate close to that observed in the first half of 2015.",
        "Further stable GDP growth would be supported by domestic factors, including the good situation in the labour market and the enterprise sector, the high capacity utilization and wide availability and relatively low cost of credit.",
        "The increase in activity in most sectors may also have been supported by low commodity prices and a certain weakening of the zloty exchange rate in recent months.",
        "Economic recovery in the euro area should also contribute to further stable growth.",
        "In turn, the deterioration of the economic situation in China and other emerging countries could have an adverse impact on GDP growth.",
        "At the same time, the majority of Council members highlighted that in view of the weaker outlook for growth in the emerging countries, and also taking into consideration the slightly worse than expected data from the Polish economy in the recent period, the risk of a weakening in domestic activity growth had increased.",
        "According to certain Council members, there was increased risk of a strong external shock which – by weakening the economic growth of Poland’s trading partners and causing a deterioration in investors sentiment towards the assets of emerging markets – could lead to a slowdown in Polish GDP growth.",
        "Council members drew attention to the fact that in light of such circumstances, it was important to maintain high resilience of the Polish economy to external shocks and support long-term economic growth.",
        "Certain Council members also highlighted the need to increase the innovation in the economy and remove barriers to development of small and medium-sized enterprises.",
        "In their opinion, this could lead to an increase in labour productivity and, as a result, accelerate wage growth and value added contained in Polish products.",
        "However, certain Council members emphasised that due to the upcoming parliamentary elections, proposals for changes in economic policy had been appearing which, if they were to be implemented, would adversely affect the state of public finances and thereby weaken the resilience of the Polish economy to external shocks.",
        "While discussing the situation on the credit market, Council members considered that growth in credit for the private sector remained moderate.",
        "It was pointed out that the parliamentary work on the currency conversion of some loans denominated in foreign currencies was a factor of uncertainty for the banking sector, and therefore for credit growth.",
        "It was noted that the introduction of the regulatory solutions currently under consideration could contribute to a decline in credit growth and a reduction in tax revenue.",
        "Moreover, for some banks it could result in the need to increase their capital.",
        "While discussing inflation developments in the economy, Council members pointed to the fact that despite continued deflation, its scale was gradually diminishing.",
        "However, the majority of Council members considered that in view of the output gap remaining negative, moderate growth of nominal wages and the fall in commodity prices on global markets, there was still no inflationary pressure.",
        "Some Council members drew attention to the persistence of producer price deflation, which could be prolonged due to the renewed fall of commodity prices.",
        "However, these members pointed out that the continued decline in producer prices had not yet had a clearly negative impact on the economic situation of enterprises.",
        "While discussing the outlook for inflation, Council members assessed that in the coming quarters price growth would most likely continue to pick up gradually, as indicated by most forecasts.",
        "However, some Council members pointed out that the pace of price growth return to positive territory may be hampered in the coming quarters by the new fall in commodity prices in global markets.",
        "Another risk factor to the acceleration of price growth was the marked slowdown of the Chinese economy, which dragged on demand growth in other countries, and the effects of yuan devaluation, reducing the import prices of Chinese products.",
        "However, certain Council members stressed that price growth in the near term might be boosted by the growth in the prices of vegetables and fruit due to the drought, which had reduced the domestic output of these products.",
        "With regard to the decision on interest rates, the majority of Council members acknowledged that in view of the expected stable economic growth, which will not result in imbalances in the economy, and at the same time the gradual increase in price growth towards the inflation target, a stabilisation of nominal interest rates at the current level is justified.",
        "Some Council members emphasised that the stabilisation of interest rates strengthens the resilience of the Polish economy to shocks, particularly in view of considerable uncertainty with regard to global economic outlook and increased volatility in international financial markets.",
        "Certain Council members pointed out, that the real interest rates ex ante, i.e.",
        "adjusted for forecasted inflation, were at low levels.",
        "However, certain Council members were of the opinion that in the coming months it could be justified to consider raising interest rates.",
        "In their opinion, such a scenario was supported by the prospect of increased price growth amidst probable further improvement in economic conditions.",
        "In their opinion, an interest rate hike should also be considered due to the increased risk of strong external shocks, since this would increase room for monetary easing in the event of negative shocks.",
        "The majority of Council members pointed out that due to the possibility of a stronger economic slowdown in China and renewed fall in commodity prices, uncertainty regarding economic activity and price developments in Poland had increased and the balance of risks for economic growth and inflation had shifted downwards.",
        "However, these members assessed that the most likely scenario was a stabilisation of interest rates.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 1.50%, the lombard rate at 2.50%, the deposit rate at 0.50% and the rediscount rate at 1.75%.",
        "at the same time that the asset purchase programme in the euro area had no significant effect on activity in the real economy.",
        "In this context, certain members cited the example of the United States, where short-term positive effects of quantitative easing resulted – in their opinion – from directing a large part of the central bank's programme at the purchase of real estate assets.",
        "As the ECB’s asset purchase programme concerns largely Treasury bonds, it would have – in their opinion – only a minor impact on the real economy.",
        "Some Council members assessed that further developments in the Greek economy were a source of risk for economic growth in the euro area.",
        "Certain members of the Council emphasized, however, that the effects of a possible insolvency of Greece for the financial markets might be limited, due to the ECB’s current quantitative easing programme, as well as the relatively small share of the private sector among Greek creditors.",
        "While analysing the economic situation in the United States, Council members pointed to a slowdown in GDP growth in 2015 Q1.",
        "Factors that could adversely affect activity in the US economy were highlighted, including the cold winter, the appreciation of the dollar, and the previously observed strong decline in oil prices, which had dragged down profitability and had reduced investment of oil producers in this country.",
        "It was emphasized that deteriorating data in the recent period had postponed the expectations for interest rate hikes in the United States.",
        "Some members of the Council assessed that it had been difficult to determine the persistence of the slowdown, although recovery had been still expected to continue.",
        "Certain Council members assessed that since the economic crisis, the trend of GDP growth in the US had been generally constant.",
        "They also pointed out that GDP growth projections in the United States had been overoptimistic for the past few years, which forced their subsequent downward revisions.",
        "Certain Council members argued that the long-term GDP growth in the US economy could be adversely affected by the quantitative easing programmes conducted in the past by the Federal Reserve.",
        "Members of the Council pointed out that improvement in the outlook for growth in developed economies had been accompanied by slowing GDP growth in many emerging economies.",
        "Attention was also drawn to the recession in Russia and Ukraine.",
        "Certain members of the Council pointed out that a possible further escalation of the conflict between these countries had posed a risk to economic growth in the external environment of the Polish economy.",
        "Some Council members also underlined the decline in economic growth in China.",
        "They assessed that imbalances in this economy, which could be observed in the real estate market, and in the recent period also in the stock market, posed a risk of a sharp drop in GDP growth.",
        "Certain Council members argued, however, that the rising share of consumption (at the expense of investment) in GDP growth might reduce the risk of a sharp drop in demand.",
        "Council members pointed out that price growth in the global economy, including in the euro area and in the United States, had been still very low, however deflation in the euro area had decreased.",
        "It was emphasized that a certain rise in oil prices in the world markets in recent weeks had been accompanied by a slight decline in food prices.",
        "Certain members of the Council argued that the observed decline in commodity prices had been a symptom of a downward phase in the long-term cycle in the commodity market.",
        "Therefore, they argued that global inflation would remain low in the coming years.",
        "While analysing the situation in the Polish economy, members of the Council pointed to the continuing economic recovery and the prospects for a gradual pick-up in economic growth, driven by both internal factors, and the expected further improvement in the economic situation in the euro area.",
        "Council members assessed that the continuing economic recovery was reflected in good data from industry, particularly in export-related branches, as well as the pick-up in production in the construction and the persistently favourable financial situation of enterprises.",
        "It was assessed that the retail sales data and consumer sentiment indicators had suggested continuing steady growth in consumption.",
        "It was argued that economic conditions had been supported by the improvement of the labour market situation, including wage and employment growth.",
        "Certain Council members pointed out that suggested wage growth in the public sector could support wage growth in the economy.",
        "Yet certain members of the Council pointed to the structural problems faced by the Polish economy: high unemployment and low wages, and thus the small share of wages in GDP growth.",
        "These factors – they argued – limited consumption of households.",
        "Council members pointed to high investment growth, which supported growth in domestic economic activity.",
        "In this context, a significant percentage of enterprises planning to embark on new investments in business surveys was noted.",
        "Some Council members emphasized that in the coming quarters investment growth in the economy would be fuelled by the inflow of EU funds under the new budgetary perspective.",
        "Certain Council members also pointed to a possible pick-up in housing investment, driven by the improvement in the labour market situation and the decline in interest rates on loans.",
        "These members also assessed that accelerating investment would be accompanied by high growth in inventory, usually strongly pro-cyclical.",
        "Certain members of the Council argued, however, that although in the first half of 2015 investment growth might slow down – which in their opinion may be a delayed effect of the economic slowdown recorded in the second half of 2014 – the coming quarters were expected to see its continued recovery.",
        "They argued that the continuing strong growth in investment might be connected to low investment growth recorded in the previous years.",
        "Other Council members judged that due to the much faster growth in investment than consumer demand, investment growth might decrease in the coming quarters.",
        "While analysing trends in lending, some Council members assessed that lending had continued to expand moderately.",
        "In this context, certain Council members highlighted, in particular, the absence of any significant pick-up in the growth of corporate investment loans, despite the decline in interest rates charged on those loans.",
        "These members additionally pointed out that as interest rates on fixed term deposits had diminished, so had the share of those deposits in total household deposits, which had been accompanied by acceleration in inflows of capital to investment funds.",
        "Certain Council members pointed out that following several years of fiscal policy tightening, the impact of this policy on demand growth in the economy would be probably neutral this year.",
        "With regard to public finance, certain Council members deemed that as the deficit of this sector had declined, the Excessive Deficit Procedure with regard to Poland might be lifted, which would be favourable in terms of the rating of Polish bonds, and hence the cost of debt servicing.",
        "Yet, other Council members argued that the public sector deficit was relatively high if the current rise in domestic demand was taken into account, while the sources of reducing the deficit applied in the past years had been exhausted.",
        "As a result, they believed that in the event of a next slowdown, fiscal policy might have limited scope for supporting demand in the economy.",
        "Some Council members assessed that despite the recovery, a negative output gap prevailed in the economy.",
        "As a result, the annual price growth, including most core inflation measures, remained negative.",
        "These members also emphasised the absence of cost pressure in the economy, as indicated by a further producer price decline resulting from the previous sharp fall in commodity prices and moderate wage growth.",
        "In this context, business surveys were cited, which pointed to the absence of the risk of wage pressure arising in the nearest future.",
        "The consistently low level of inflation expectations of economic agents were also highlighted.",
        "Considering the above circumstances, these members assessed that the return of inflation to the target would be gradual.",
        "Yet some Council members were of the opinion that the prolonged deflation was primarily the result of supply shocks related to the fall in commodity prices as well as low inflation in the euro area.",
        "Certain Council members also underlined that the decline in prices in Poland had been supported by the embargo on exports of certain Polish goods to Russia and by rising labour productivity.",
        "Certain Council members emphasised that as the impact of the supply shocks wore away, inflation in Poland would rise faster than the March NBP projection envisaged.",
        "In their opinion the steeper rise in inflation would also result from a higher than was assumed in the projection GDP growth in Poland and its external environment, which would be accompanied by faster domestic unit labour cost growth.",
        "At the same time they argued that in their opinion domestic demand growth had already exceeded potential output growth, which could lead to a deterioration in the current account balance, especially if the improvement in the terms of trade were to come to a halt.",
        "Council members assessed that the annual price growth would remain negative in the coming quarters, mainly due to the previously observed sharp fall in commodity prices.",
        "At the same time, the expected gradual acceleration of economic growth, amidst recovery in the euro area and good situation in the domestic labour market, reduced the risk of inflation remaining below the target in the medium term.",
        "Therefore, the Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 1.50%, the lombard rate at 2.50%, the deposit rate at 0.50% and the rediscount rate at 1.75%."

    "2012": [
        "At its meeting, the Monetary Policy Council discussed the current and future monetary policy decisions against the background of external and domestic macroeconomic developments, including inflationary processes in the Polish economy.",
        "While discussing the external conditions of the Polish economy, attention was drawn to the further downward revisions of GDP growth forecasts for the euro area, suggesting stagnation in the euro area economy in 2012.",
        "Some Council members pointed out that banks’ efforts to increase their equity capital posed risk of further reduction in lending in the euro area countries, what would additionally worsen the outlook for the euro area growth.",
        "At the same time, it was noted that the business climate in the United States had improved, although some members of the Council argued that the acceleration in consumption in 2011 Q4, may turn out to be temporary and it should be expected that subsequent quarters will bring weaker growth in the US economy.",
        "While analysing the external environment of the Polish economy, members of the Council drew attention to the fact that despite persisting uncertainty connected with the fiscal crisis in some euro area countries, the sentiment in the global financial markets improved.",
        "This was reflected in the appreciation of currencies of developing economies, including the zloty.",
        "At the same time, the Council members emphasised that it was difficult to assess whether zloty strengthening would be sustained.",
        "This was due to the fact that although the equilibrium exchange rate most probably remained stronger than the market rate, the zloty exchange rate is currently primarily driven by global factors, including, in particular, changes in risk aversion in the financial markets.",
        "While discussing the outlook for the growth in domestic economy, members of the Council pointed to signs of weakening in economic activity, in particular, to slowdown in the growth of Polish exports to the euro area, persistently heightened unemployment rate and weaker growth in household lending.",
        "Yet, in the opinion of some Council members, the slowdown in the domestic economic activity may be less pronounced than previously anticipated, which is suggested by an improvement in some economic climate indicators pointing to a relative resilience of the Polish economy to the worsening of business activity abroad.",
        "Some members of the Council assessed, however, that GDP growth in Poland was likely to decline substantially, what, in their opinion, would be driven, on the one hand, by further fiscal tightening, and, on the other hand, by weaker private consumption growth, being the result of the rebuild of household savings, following a considerable fall in the savings rate observed in the recent period.",
        "At the same time, according to those Council members, slight decline in production capacity utilization, considerable uncertainty and a large share of replacement investment in total corporate investments, which can easily be discontinued, make further investment acceleration rather unlikely.",
        "Additionally, the appreciation of the zloty, amidst worsening business climate abroad, is likely to lower net exports contribution to domestic GDP growth.",
        "While discussing inflationary developments, members of the Council emphasized that the anticipated weakening of the domestic economic activity, connected with both slowdown in the global economic growth, as well as, tightening of the domestic fiscal policy, would support gradual decline in inflation.",
        "Also, the appreciation of the zloty at the beginning of 2012 would be a factor lowering inflation.",
        "It was pointed out that inflationary pressure in the subsequent quarters would also be curbed by elevated unemployment and low wage pressure.",
        "At the same time, some members of the Council pointed out that inflation in Poland had been running above the upper limit for deviations from the target, i.e.",
        "3.5%, for a year now.",
        "Members of the Council also emphasized that despite some decline in inflation, the NBP short-term forecasts pointed to a risk of inflation remaining above the target of 2.5% throughout 2012.",
        "In turn, in the opinion of few Council members, inflation persisting above the target for an extended period of time creates a risk of wider indexation of contracts, including wage contracts, which would be a factor strengthening inflation persistence and preventing it from returning to the target.",
        "Those Council members pointed out that a similar effect may be brought about by inflation expectations of both households and corporates running at an elevated level.",
        "Members of the Council emphasized that growth in energy prices would continue to push up domestic inflation.",
        "Against this background, it was noted that the persistently growing demand for oil in the global economy, amidst limited growth of oil supply (especially, taking into account geopolitical tensions in the oil mining regions), may contribute to higher crude oil prices also in the long-term, limiting inflation decline in Poland.",
        "Some members of the Council pointed out that the NBP surveys showed an increase in the number of companies intending to raise prices of their products in response to the expected further surge in prices of commodities and materials.",
        "In the opinion of few Council members, domestic inflation may also be increased by higher inflation abroad, should the expansionary policy pursued by major central banks, including continued quantitative easing, translate into global inflationary pressure.",
        "Few Council members additionally pointed out that amidst the expected decline in domestic economic activity, budget revenues growth may be lower than assumed what, considering the planned scale of fiscal tightening, posed a risk of indirect tax increases.",
        "This would, in turn, translate into further price increase in the Polish economy, extending the period of heightened inflation.",
        "Moreover, few Council members noted that despite keeping the NBP interest rates unchanged in the recent period, interest rate increase in the interbank market in 2011 Q4 meant that monetary policy conditions in Poland became more restrictive, in particular, taking into account the appreciation of the zloty at the beginning of 2012.",
        "However, some members of the Council argued that the real interest rates were not high, considering the structural factors and the current macroeconomic situation in Poland.",
        "Those Council members also pointed out that the total increase in interest on loans to the private sector in 2011 was, despite interest rate rise in the interbank market at the end of 2011, somewhat lower than the increases in the NBP reference rate implemented by the Council in the first half of 2011.",
        "Moreover those Council members emphasized that the growth in money supply had been on the rise, reaching now a relatively high level.",
        "While discussing the decision on the NBP interest rates, the members of the Council agreed that they should remain unchanged at the current meeting.",
        "As regards future monetary policy decisions, the majority of the Council members maintained their view that should the relatively fast domestic economic growth, elevated inflation and high inflation expectations continue, the increase in the NBP interest rates cannot not be ruled out.",
        "The majority of the Council members also pointed out that the decrease in inflation driven by the expected decline in demand might prove slower than previously anticipated.",
        "In this context, it was still emphasized that the incoming data on economic activity and inflationary processes in Poland in the coming months, as well as the NBP March projection, would be helpful in assessing the outlook for medium-term growth and inflation.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged at the following levels: reference rate at 4.50%, lombard rate at 6.00%, deposit rate at 3.00% and rediscount rate at 4.75%.",
        "At its meeting, the Monetary Policy Council discussed the current and future monetary policy decisions against the background of the external and domestic macroeconomic developments, including inflationary processes.",
        "While analysing the external conditions of macroeconomic developments in Poland, some Council members pointed out that GDP growth abroad was likely to remain weak in the coming quarters.",
        "In particular, it was emphasised that should there be no substantial improvement in the US labour market, the revival in the United States may slow down, especially amidst the announced fiscal tightening in this economy.",
        "Attention was also drawn to the fact that economic activity in the euro area was significantly weaker than in the United States, albeit considerable differences could be seen across countries.",
        "Few Council members argued that notwithstanding the slow economic growth in the euro area, the German economy– the main recipient of Polish exports – was in a relatively good condition.",
        "Council members indicated that in many countries inflation persisted at a high level.",
        "This largely resulted from rising global prices of energy commodities, which were partly driven by unconventional monetary policy measures undertaken by the major central banks.",
        "Some Council members indicated at this juncture that increasing commodity prices would continue to drive up inflation also in the medium term.",
        "Increasing commodity prices will be supported by both – rising demand, especially on the part of the major emerging economies, and by expanding production of biofuels.",
        "While discussing the outlook for domestic economic growth in the current year, some Council members assessed that the economic slowdown in Poland was likely to be smaller than previously expected, which might be indicated by strong data incoming over the first few months of 2012.",
        "These Council members underlined, in particular, that private consumption would most probably remain to be a factor supporting economic growth in the nearest quarters; yet amidst temporarily slow real income growth, consumption would be financed, to a greater degree, by decrease in savings rate.",
        "Few Council members argued at that point that the observed lower propensity to save might be the effect of heightened inflation eroding the real value of savings.",
        "In the opinion of some members of the Council, the expected economic slowdown will also be mitigated by a further inflow of EU funds supporting investment growth.",
        "However, few Council members stressed that consumption growth had been gradually decreasing since mid-2011 and it could not be ruled out that its contribution to GDP growth would continue to shrink in the subsequent quarters.",
        "Moreover, these members of the Council argued that since firms' propensity to invest highly depends on business conditions abroad, amidst the expected slow global growth, the contribution of private investment to GDP growth might also decrease in the coming quarters.",
        "Thus, in the opinion of those Council members, the weakening in economic growth in Poland might turn out significant.",
        "Some Council members argued however that even if economic slowdown in the nearest quarters turned out significant, 2013 might be expected to bring gradual acceleration of GDP growth.",
        "In the opinion of those Council members, growth would be supported by rising private sector demand.",
        "Acceleration of consumption in 2013 will be driven by the expected fall in inflation, which will boost real disposable income growth, whereas acceleration of investment will be supported by the anticipated improvement in economic conditions abroad.",
        "Improved external conditions should also be conducive to exports expansion in 2013.",
        "Moreover, the extent of further fiscal tightening in Poland is likely to be smaller than in 2012, thus its dampening impact on the 2013 domestic demand growth will be limited.",
        "While discussing inflationary developments, Council members stressed the fact that – like in other countries – heightened inflation had been largely driven by external factors, including rising global prices of energy commodities, which translated into higher prices of energy, and in particular into higher prices of fuels.",
        "February saw also a rise in domestic prices of tobacco products, following an increase in excise tax, which also increased core inflation rate.",
        "Council members pointed out that over the next few months, elevated inflation would continue to be driven, above all, by fast-growing prices of energy and food.",
        "Moreover, in the opinion of few members of the Council, due to European Football Championship, restaurant and hotel prices could be expected to increase in some Polish cities in June 2012; these prices might not fall back to their previous levels immediately after Euro 2012.",
        "According to few Council members, an additional risk to inflation in the short term is the likely rise in prices of services and fees that are at the discretion of local government units.",
        "As regards the impact of the exchange rate on inflation, few Council members assessed that the likely appreciation of the equilibrium exchange rate would limit the anti-inflationary influence of the exchange rate appreciation at the beginning of 2012 on domestic prices.",
        "At the same time, these Council members pointed out that exchange rate fluctuations were closely connected to shifts in risk aversion in the global financial markets that are hard to predict.",
        "In this context, attention was drawn to the persisting uncertainty concerning the situation in the financial markets, especially in Europe.",
        "The Council members emphasised that inflation was now expected to remain above the target levels for longer than previously anticipated, which, according to most members of the Council, increased the risk of inflation persisting at an elevated level and provided grounds for considering monetary policy tightening.",
        "Most Council members pointed that – as elevated inflation was largely driven by factors beyond the direct influence of the domestic monetary policy - the increase in the NBP interest rates should primarily prevent persisting heightened inflation expectations, mounting wage pressures and emerging of second-round effects.",
        "However, few Council members argued that amid continued elevated unemployment, still moderate wage growth and further fiscal tightening constraining public sector wage growth, the risk of second-round effects was limited.",
        "Referring to the level of interest rates, some Council members emphasised that, notwithstanding the monetary policy tightening of 2011, interest rates were currently at moderate levels, what is reflected – in their opinion – in a relatively fast growth of monetary aggregates.",
        "In the opinion of these members of the Council, moderate level of interest rates in Poland was further evidenced by the comparison of inflation deviation from the target and the estimated output gaps in Poland and other countries.",
        "However, other Council members assessed that amidst strongly expansionary monetary policies of the world's major central banks, monetary policy easing by central banks in developing countries and persisting uncertainty about the economic outlook abroad, the monetary policy conducted by the NBP was not overly accommodative.",
        "Moreover, few Council members also stressed that the transmission of the monetary policy tightening in the first half of 2011 was so far not full.",
        "In the opinion of few Council members the impact of the 2011 interest rates increases on economic activity seemed rather small.",
        "Some Council members pointed out that restricted availability of foreign currency loans to households had strengthened the impact of NBP interest rates increases on credit growth, and thus on private demand.",
        "With regard to the decision on the NBP interest rates, the majority of Council members found that – given a likely persistence of factors fuelling inflation that are beyond the direct influence of domestic monetary policy – the limited scale of expected economic slowdown might not decrease inflationary pressure to a degree sufficient for inflation returning to the target in the medium term.",
        "The risk of inflation running above the target in the medium term is additionally increased by elevated inflation expectations.",
        "In view of the above, the Council members deemed it appropriate to consider monetary policy tightening in the near future.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members, the tightening should take place as soon as possible; hence, in their opinion, it was justified to increase interest rates at the current meeting.",
        "However, most Council members argued that a possible increase in interest rates should be preceded by a more thorough assessment of the state of the economy and the scale of the expected economic slowdown.",
        "This assessment will be feasible after the data on the subsequent months of 2012 has been analysed, since the January and February 2012 data might have been distorted by one-off factors.",
        "Therefore they decided that the NBP interest rates should be kept unchanged at the current meeting.",
        "Nevertheless, monetary tightening might prove justified in the nearest future, unless signs of considerable economic weakening in Poland appear and the outlook for inflation returning to the target improves.",
        "In the opinion of few Council members, should weakening in the domestic economic growth in the subsequent quarters prove considerable due to low activity abroad, monetary policy tightening might not be necessary.",
        "A motion to raise the NBP interest rates by 25 basis points was put forward at the meeting.",
        "The motion did not pass.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: reference rate at 4.50%, lombard rate at 6.00%, deposit rate at 3.00%, rediscount rate at 4.75%.",
        "At its meeting, the Monetary Policy Council discussed the current and future monetary policy decisions against the background of the domestic and external macroeconomic conditions, especially including inflation developments.",
        "While analysing the external conditions, the Council observed that the persistently unfavourable economic climate in the external environment of Poland has an adverse impact on domestic economic activity.",
        "At the same time, the Council members pointed to the scale of fiscal tightening in the United States in 2013 as a factor posing uncertainty to the global economic growth in the nearest term.",
        "However, some Council members emphasised that in the second half of 2013 GDP growth may accelerate somewhat in Western European economies, including Germany, Poland's main trading partner.",
        "Also, a few Council members drew attention to the structural adjustments in the peripheral economies of the euro area, which in the longer term should contribute to higher growth in these countries and bring an improvement in the economic situation of the entire euro area.",
        "While addressing economic conditions in Poland, a further slowdown in the economy was pointed out, confirmed by the 2012 Q3 GDP data.",
        "It was emphasised that the slowdown is driven not only by external but also domestic factors.",
        "While analysing factors behind the decline in domestic demand in 2012 Q3, the Council members highlighted a decrease in investment and consumption growth deceleration.",
        "They observed that household consumption is adversely affected by a decline in real disposable income.",
        "As households strive to smooth consumption, it is accompanied by savings rate declining to its historical low.",
        "It was pointed out that a decrease in disposable income is in particular related to deteriorating labour market conditions.",
        "While analysing the incoming labour market data, it was pointed out that wage growth decelerated in 2012 Q3, which was accompanied by a further decrease in unit labour costs growth rate.",
        "At the same time, some Council members argued that the rising unemployment rate does not indicate a risk of higher wage demands.",
        "A few Council members argued that higher unemployment rate may be partially linked to rising equilibrium unemployment rate, which, in their opinion, is suggested by the growth in the number of vacancies and rising employee recruitment costs.",
        "With reference to the outlook for economic growth in Poland, the Council members pointed out that GDP growth will remain weak in the subsequent quarters.",
        "Consumption will continue to be hampered, in particular, by deteriorating labour market conditions.",
        "Another factor negatively affecting consumption is households’ limited capacity to increase consumption through further reduction in the savings rate.",
        "In the opinion of the Council, investment growth in the subsequent quarters will continue to be negative, as indicated, in particular, by further decline in the cost estimate value of newly launched investment projects.",
        "It was pointed out that declining public investment, including projects co-financed with EU funds, will remain a factor dampening investment.",
        "A few Council members observed that the scale of decline in investment may be curbed by the \"Polish Investment\" government programme, whose effects, however, will be noticeable in the second half of 2013 at the earliest.",
        "At the same time it was anticipated that economic growth will continue to be driven by net exports.",
        "Yet, in this context, future demand from the euro area and the zloty exchange rate developments constitute a risk factor.",
        "Some Council members argued that as the economic conditions abroad are expected to improve, economic growth in Poland may also accelerate in the second half of 2013.",
        "Other Council members observed, in turn, that despite possible economic climate improvement in Poland in the second half of 2013, current data indicate considerable weakening in economic activity and rising risk of recession.",
        "According to some Council members, the observed slowdown in GDP growth partially reflects a decline in potential economic growth due to the fact that factors hitherto enhancing competitiveness of the Polish economy are on the wane.",
        "Therefore, these Council members were of the opinion that the negative output gap in the Polish economy may be moderate.",
        "Yet, other Council members indicated that potential GDP growth may have declined only slightly in the aftermath of the crisis, and consequently, given the current GDP growth rate, the output gap in the economy is widening.",
        "While addressing inflation developments, the Council members drew attention to the fact that both CPI and core inflation has recently declined.",
        "A downward revision in households' inflation expectations was also emphasised.",
        "At the same time, the majority of the Council members expressed an opinion that the subsequent quarters will see a considerable decline in inflation.",
        "According to the Council members, lower inflation will be supported by supply factors, including cuts in the prices of natural gas as of January 2013, as well as the widening output gap and the lack of wage pressure in the economy.",
        "At the same time, some Council members pointed to uncertainty about future inflation developments.",
        "The uncertainty is related, in particular, to the developments in the zloty exchange rate which is affected by investors' volatile sentiment.",
        "These factors may lead to a reversal in capital flows and increased volatility of the zloty exchange rate.",
        "At the same time, a few Council members pointed to the risk related to the strongly expansionary monetary policy of major central banks, which may eventually result in inflation rising significantly across the global economy.",
        "Yet, some Council members presented the opinion that given the persistence of the factors hitherto increasing inflation, inflation is unlikely to decline significantly in the nearest years.",
        "In this context, some Council members pointed out that decline in inflation expected in the subsequent quarters will be driven by supply factors and hence will not have any significant impact on wage and inflationary pressures in the economy.",
        "These members also pointed to a possible acceleration in economic growth in the second half of 2013, which may somewhat increase inflationary pressure.",
        "It was assessed that the NBP interest rates should be lowered at the current meeting, which should support economic activity and reduce the risk of inflation falling below the target in the medium term.",
        "The Council members differed in their opinions as to the scale of the NBP interest rate cuts, both at the current meeting and during the entire cycle.",
        "Most Council members pointed out that given the persistence of inflation and the risks related to price growth within the horizon of the strongest monetary policy impact, the reduction in the NBP interest rates should not be significant.",
        "A few of these members additionally indicated that interest rate cuts may weaken the zloty exchange rate, and thus negatively affect inflation, as well as prompt households to deposit savings outside the banking system.",
        "At the same time, a few Council members argued that deep interest rate cuts may bring further decline in the savings rate, thus contributing to building imbalances in the economy.",
        "Other Council members, in turn, considered that in the current economic conditions, even a somewhat deeper interest rate reduction would not lead to inflationary and wage pressure in the subsequent quarters.",
        "In the opinion of those Council members, considering the degree of economic downturn and growing risk of inflation falling below the NBP's inflation target in the coming quarters, it was advisable at the current meeting to reduce the NBP interest rates more than previously, and according to a few Council members – far more than previously.",
        "Those members observed that the arguments in favour of a relatively prompt monetary policy easing include, in particular, the length of lags in the monetary policy transmission mechanism.",
        "In the opinion of those Council members, when making decisions concerning interest rates in Poland it was also necessary to consider the level of interest rates across the world, including in the main developed economies.",
        "At the meeting, a motion was submitted to lower the basic NBP interest rates by 1.50 percentage point.",
        "The motion did not pass.",
        "A motion was also submitted to lower the basic NBP interest rates by 0.50 percentage point.",
        "The motion did not pass.",
        "At the meeting, a motion was also submitted to lower the basic NBP interest rates by 0.25 percentage point.",
        "The Council decided to lower the basic interest rates by 0.25 percentage point, to the following levels: reference rate at 4.25%, lombard rate at 5.75%, deposit rate at 2.75%, rediscount rate at 4.50%.",
        "At its meeting, the Monetary Policy Council discussed the current and future monetary policy decisions against the background of the external and domestic macroeconomic conditions, including inflation developments.",
        "While analysing external conditions for economic activity in Poland, the Council members pointed out that data released since the September meeting confirm a slowdown in global economic activity, including ongoing recession in the euro area, merely moderate growth in the United States and economic slowdown in emerging economies.",
        "In this context, attention was drawn to the fact that the unfavourable outlook for economic growth had prompted the central banks of the largest developed economies to further ease their monetary policy, which improved sentiment in the global financial markets.",
        "However, according to some Council members, the improvement may prove to be temporary.",
        "In particular, the European Central Bank announced the launch of new programme of purchasing government bonds issued by countries most severely affected by the sovereign debt crisis, withdrawing its previous bond purchase programme at the same time.",
        "In turn, the Federal Reserve shifted the declared date of the first interest rates increases from the end of 2014 to mid2015, and implemented a new MBS purchase programme.",
        "Some Council members were of the opinion that measures undertaken by major central banks should support revival of economic activity in Poland’s external environment, in particular, in the euro area, where improvement in consumer and investor confidence about the prospects for overcoming the crisis may be expected.",
        "While analysing economic situation in Poland, the Council members pointed out that the deceleration of industrial production, a further decline in construction output and weaker retail sales growth indicate that Poland’s GDP growth continues to decrease.",
        "This is also signalled by worsening of business sentiment indicators, including deteriorating forecasts of demand and orders.",
        "At the same time, some Council members pointed to the data that could indicate a limited scale of further economic slowdown.",
        "These include some improvement of liquidity position of enterprises in 2012 Q3 and only slightly weaker growth in lending to the private sector (visible in data adjusted for exchange rate changes).",
        "When discussing the current business conditions in Poland and their outlook, some Council members highlighted that the situation in the labour market was deteriorating faster than expected.",
        "They pointed to a decrease in employment and slow wage growth in the corporate sector, as well as to the gradually rising unemployment.",
        "In their opinion, weak growth in households’ real disposable income will constrain consumption, especially since there is no room for further significant reduction in savings rate and availability of consumer loans is limited.",
        "Considering that at the initial stage of the global financial crisis, consumption was one of the factors spurring domestic economic activity, the currently observed deceleration in consumption – according to those Council members – points to the risk of a significant economic slowdown in the coming quarters.",
        "At the same time, deteriorating outlook for demand dampens investment prospects, already undermined by rising spare capacity utilisation.",
        "Those Council members also argued that the coming quarters might be expected to see lower net exports contribution to GDP and further fiscal tightening.",
        "The impact of the above mentioned factors is reflected in the downward revision of the 2013 economic growth forecasts for Poland released by external institutions.",
        "Some Council members deemed however, that at present it is difficult to assess the scale of further economic slowdown, which – according to few of them – may prove moderate and relatively shortlived.",
        "Consequently, GDP growth is likely to run only slightly below the potential output growth.",
        "Furthermore, few Council members pointed out that consumption and investment may be expected to pick up gradually as early as 2013, boosting GDP growth.",
        "In their opinion, this scenario will be supported by the improvement of business conditions in Poland’s external environment, that may be larger than had been expected before the announcement of additional expansionary monetary policy measures by major central banks.",
        "Few Council members also pointed out that the intended relaxation by the Polish Financial Supervision Authority of recommendations related to household loans will positively influence domestic activity.",
        "Moreover, the reduction of fiscal deficit may be lower than anticipated for in the Convergence Programme, 2012 Update.",
        "While discussing inflation developments, it was emphasised that price growth is decelerating while inflation still remains above the NBP inflation target as well as above the upper limit of deviations from the target.",
        "It was pointed out that the elevated inflation level results largely from supply-side factors which are beyond the direct influence of domestic monetary policy, amidst gradually declining core inflation.",
        "Some Council members stressed that weakening economic activity accompanied with decline in wage pressure and employment, significantly limits the risk of secondround effects, and thus, should support inflation decline over the next few quarters.",
        "Some Council members assessed however, that inflation returning to the target is subject to risk posed by global commodity prices, whose further growth may be supported by strongly expansionary monetary policy conducted by major central banks.",
        "These Council members argued that this factor may limit the scale of inflation decline, as inflation is expected to decrease largely on account of slower growth in food and energy prices, i.e.",
        "price categories closely related to developments in global commodity prices.",
        "This was reflected in some upward revision of some short-term inflation forecasts prepared by the NBP.",
        "These Council members also pointed out that short-term forecasts (with horizon of 12 months) do not point to the risk of inflation falling significantly below the target within their horizon.",
        "Other members of the Council argued that global commodity price growth should decelerate, as growth in demand for commodities from the largest emerging economies is weakening.",
        "Gradually slowing down economic growth in those countries makes commodity prices, which are already high, unlikely to continue to rise at the present pace.",
        "Therefore, according to these Council members, the developments in global commodity prices will support inflation decline in 2013.",
        "Moreover, it was pointed out that all the available macroeconomic forecasts, including the NBP July projection, suggest that inflation is to decline.",
        "The July NBP projection expects inflation to reach a level close to 2.5% in the first half of 2013, and subsequently fall below the target.",
        "Those Council members emphasised that the risk of inflation falling significantly below 2.5% is at the moment greater than assessed in July, due to a more severe than anticipated worsening of economic outlook and labour market conditions.",
        "During the discussion, Council members also highlighted exchange rate developments.",
        "Some members argued that the zloty exchange rate is currently determined mainly by investors’ assessments of the outlook for domestic economic growth.",
        "Other Council members pointed out that exchange rate movements may be also affected by interest rate disparity between Poland and the euro area.",
        "While considering monetary policy decisions, some Council members argued that the NBP interest rates should be lowered at the current meeting.",
        "In the opinion of those Council members, the anticipated slowing of economic growth to levels significantly below potential output growth poses a risk of inflation falling below the target in the longer term, which justifies monetary policy easing.",
        "Moreover, the forecast decline in inflation to level consistent with the inflation target in the coming quarters will keep real interest rates deflated by the expected inflation – even if NBP rates are lowered – clearly positive, while at the moment real interest rates in Poland are high relative to other countries.",
        "In the assessment of these Council members, monetary policy easing is also justified by the likely persistence of low economic activity abroad and further fiscal tightening in Poland in 2013.",
        "Few Council members additionally observed that a serious economic slowdown might impede the process of reducing the general government deficit, which could, in turn, weaken the zloty and increase inflation.",
        "Hence, in their opinion, monetary policy should be eased relatively fast to limit the risk of strong economic downturn.",
        "Other members of the Council concluded that a potential interest rate cuts should take into account the outlook for medium-term economic growth and inflation that will be presented in the November projection of the NBP.",
        "Some Council members pointed out that the current interest rates level might be appropriate to enable inflation returning to the target over the next few quarters, while interest rate cuts amidst continuing weak economic climate abroad might have limited impact on the domestic economic activity.",
        "Few Council members assessed that one should still take into consideration a risk of strong negative shock in the external environment of the Polish economy, whose accommodation through increase in private consumption or expansionary fiscal policy depends on the amount of savings in the economy.",
        "Given the currently observed very low household savings rate and still excessive fiscal deficit, interest rate cuts would further undermine propensity to save.",
        "This would, in turn, weaken the economy’s ability to accommodate any negative shock in the future.",
        "The majority of Council members were of the opinion that the NBP interest rates should be kept unchanged at the current meeting.",
        "Yet, should the incoming data, including the November inflation projection of the NBP, confirm that economic slowdown would become protracted, while the risk of increase in inflationary pressure be limited, the Council will ease monetary policy.",
        "A motion to lower the basic NBP interest rates by 0.50 percentage point was submitted at the meeting.",
        "The motion did not pass.",
        "A motion was also submitted to lower the basic NBP interest rates by 0.25 percentage point.",
        "The motion did not pass.",
        "The Council left the basic interest rates unchanged at the following levels: reference rate at 4.75%, lombard rate at 6.25%, deposit rate at 3.25%, rediscount rate at 5.00%.",
        "At its meeting, the Monetary Policy Council discussed the current and future monetary policy decisions against the background of the results of the November inflation and GDP projection as well as current and expected macroeconomic developments in Poland and abroad.",
        "While analysing the external conditions, it was noted that data incoming recently pointed to a lack of improvement in macroeconomic developments in the euro area.",
        "However, few Council members drew attention to the fact that economic outlook for Germany, Poland’s major trading partner, remains favourable compared to other countries of the euro area (owing to strong economic ties between Germany and hitherto faster-growing emerging economies).",
        "At the same time, some Council members emphasized that the external conditions influenced the Polish economy not only via trade channel.",
        "Accordingly, the adverse conditions in the euro area may have a much stronger dampening impact on the economic activity in Poland than would follow from solely trade channel.",
        "When discussing the current developments in Poland and their outlook, it was highlighted that a decline in industrial output and retail sales as well as a deeper decrease in construction and assembly pointed to more pronounced economic slowdown than previously anticipated.",
        "It was stressed that the NBP November projection implied risk of persistent economic slowdown.",
        "It was pointed out that the currently forecast GDP growth for the next years runs below the July projection.",
        "This downward revision was due to lower investment and consumption forecast.",
        "The Council concluded, in line with the projection, that both factors will contribute to lower than previously expected GDP growth.",
        "According to the Council, low consumption growth will result from tepid household disposable income growth and limited room for a further fall in the savings rate, related i.a.",
        "The disposable income growth will be curbed due to the ongoing deterioration in labour market conditions along with lower remittances to Poland from migrants abroad.",
        "It was emphasized that, in the previous stage of the global financial crisis, favourable financial conditions of households supported continued growth in their consumption and helped to absorb shock of increased costs of servicing their foreign currency loans resulting from zloty depreciation.",
        "It was also highlighted that in 2009 consumption growth was strengthened by fiscal loosening, while in the coming quarters the fiscal tightening will likely continue.",
        "Turning to investment activity, in the Council’s opinion, adverse demand outlook, deteriorating business sentiment and termination of EU financial perspective 2007-2013 will hamper investment growth.",
        "However, few Council members pointed to currently still favourable liquidity position of enterprises, which could trigger corporate investment growth should the demand outlook improve.",
        "Few Council members assessed that the economic growth in 2012 could be lower than implied in the NBP November projection.",
        "At the same time, other Council members stressed that over the previous 20 years similar slowdown episodes had been relatively short-lived and that the magnitude of the current slowdown compared to the previous ones – though stronger than expected – had been so far relatively shallow.",
        "Few Council members claimed that the steady improvement in the external environment of the Polish economy, assumed for the coming years in the NBP November projection and in external forecasts, would support a gradual recovery in Polish foreign trade, and consequently a gradual recovery in the domestic economic growth.",
        "While discussing current inflation developments, it was emphasized that price growth continued on a downward trend.",
        "Yet, annual inflation remained above the upper limit of deviation from the NBP inflation target.",
        "It was pointed out that the elevated annual inflation was driven largely by factors beyond the direct impact of the domestic monetary policy.",
        "These developments are accompanied by weakening domestic demand pressure, as indicated by declining core inflation.",
        "While referring to the inflation outlook against the background of the NBP November projection, the majority of the Council members stressed that the projection confirmed a significant decline of risk that the coming quarters would bring intensification of demand pressure.",
        "At the same time, the risk of inflation falling below the target over the medium term has increased.",
        "In line with the November projection, modest economic growth and deteriorating labour market conditions will support a decline in inflation.",
        "According to the majority of the Council members, weakening economic growth along with decreasing wage pressure and employment, substantially reduce the risk of second round effects and should be conducive to a marked fall in inflation in the coming quarters, even despite still elevated commodity prices.",
        "Some Council members argued that although changes in prices of commodities, including energy commodities, remain a significant risk factor for global price stability, the recent information on annexation of the Yamal contract reducing the import prices for natural gas to Poland, allows to expect lower energy price growth in Poland.",
        "The majority of the Council members argued that the growth of prices for consumer goods and services over the monetary policy horizon might run below the inflation target, albeit above the November projection path.",
        "Some of these Council members assessed that deceleration of unit labour costs could be milder than assumed in the projection, which might reduce the decline in inflation.",
        "According to these Council members, higher growth of unit labour costs relative to the path anticipated in the projection will result from lower labour productivity growth than accounted for in the projection and stronger increase in NAWRU due to hysteresis.",
        "Those Council members also noted that in the face of the fiscal imbalance it could not be ruled out that the VAT rate will be left unchanged at 23% in 2014.",
        "According to some Council members, food and energy price growth is particularly likely to run above the November projection path.",
        "Few of those Council members were of the opinion that, apart from considerable volatility of global food and energy prices, an additional source of uncertainty for inflation in Poland – larger than assumed in the projection – lies in the impact of the EU Energy and Climate Package on energy prices in Poland.",
        "In their opinion, it is equally difficult to assess the transmission of new agreements on gas import prices on domestic energy prices.",
        "As regards current and future interest rate decisions, the majority of the Council members decided that the NBP interest rate should be decreased at the current meeting.",
        "The incoming economic data had confirmed a marked deterioration in economic conditions in Poland, while the NBP November projection pointed to a risk of a protracted economic slowdown, which will curb demand pressure and pose risk of inflation falling below the target in the medium term.",
        "Interest rate cuts will limit the scale of economic downturn, and, consequently, reduce the risk of inflation falling below the target.",
        "However, few Council members were of the opinion that the NBP interest rates should be kept unchanged due to persistently elevated current inflation and remaining uncertainty about global energy commodity prices.",
        "Moreover, in their opinion, a decrease in interest rates may have a limited impact on lending amid still tight lending conditions in the banking sector.",
        "They also pointed out that a decrease in interest rates could discourage household savings in the banking system.",
        "Yet, those Council members did not rule out decreases in the interest rates at subsequent meetings of the Council might be justified, should the impact of the economic slowdown on inflation be more pronounced and the likelihood of further increases in energy prices fall.",
        "A motion to lower the NBP interest rates by 0.50 percentage point was submitted at the meeting.",
        "The motion did not pass.",
        "A motion was also submitted to lower the basic NBP interest rates by 0.25 percentage point.",
        "The Council decided to lower the basic interest rates to the following levels: reference rate to 4.50%, lombard rate to 6.00%, deposit rate to 3.00%, rediscount rate to 4.75%.",
        "At its meeting, the Monetary Policy Council discussed the current and future monetary policy decisions against the background of external and domestic macroeconomic developments, including inflationary processes.",
        "While analysing the external conditions of macroeconomic developments in the Polish economy, members of the Council pointed to the continued uncertainty about the situation in the euro area.",
        "Some members of the Council argued that the results of the elections held in France and Greece suggested the possibility of changes in economic policy of those countries and hence a weaker support for restrictive fiscal policy in some euro area countries.",
        "In this context, some members of the Council pointed to the risk of intensification of the crisis in some euro area countries which would, in turn, translate into further economic weakening.",
        "At the same time, some members of the Council argued that notwithstanding economic stagnation in the euro area, in Germany – Poland’s main trading partner – a gradual recovery in economic activity is expected.",
        "Members of the Council emphasized that uncertainty in the external environment of the Polish economy had remained elevated for a long time and could be expected to continue at a high level in the coming quarters.",
        "Some members of the Council assessed that heightened uncertainty about economic developments in the euro area and in other developed countries was becoming a permanent feature of the balance of risks for inflation and GDP; therefore, it should not be the key factor in the conduct of monetary policy in Poland.",
        "Other members of the Council argued, however, that such a high uncertainty limited the possibility of interest rate adjustments.",
        "While discussing the economic activity in Poland, some members of the Council pointed out that March had seen a significant slowdown in manufacturing and construction production.",
        "Yet, the data released in the previous months suggest that in 2012 Q1 economic growth remained relatively robust in Poland.",
        "At the same time, those members emphasised that according to the NBP’s business climate surveys, in 2012 Q1 economic situation of enterprises remained sound, with production capacity utilization improved and the number of companies planning to boost production and employment in 2012 Q2 increased.",
        "Also corporate lending rose rapidly in the first few months of 2012 and a relatively high growth in zloty housing loans to households continued, although total growth in housing loans was still decreasing.",
        "In the opinion of those members of the Council this might mean that the scale of the expected economic slowdown would be smaller than previously expected.",
        "Good financial situation of enterprises might additionally support this scenario.",
        "Few members of the Council argued, however, that weak economic activity abroad would translate into lower contribution of net exports to GDP growth in Poland, whereas heightened inflation and lower employment growth would undermine consumer demand.",
        "It was pointed out that decline in consumer loans was another factor conducive to weaker consumer demand.",
        "Those members also argued that uncertainty about the outlook for both export demand and domestic demand posed a risk of slump in corporate investment, and, consequently, sharper decline in GDP growth in Poland in the coming quarters.",
        "While analysing inflationary processes, some members of the Council pointed out that although CPI and core inflation declined slightly in March, subsequent months were likely to see, once again, higher price growth.",
        "The rise in inflation may be primarily fuelled by gas price increases and temporary rise in the prices of restaurant and hotel services (the impact of the European Football Cup in Poland).",
        "On the other hand, while addressing the outlook for inflation in the medium-term, some members of the Council emphasized that the coming quarters were likely to see continued upward pressure of external factors on inflation in Poland.",
        "Those factors included high commodity prices in the global markets, being largely the result of both rising demand for energy and food in the rapidly growing emerging markets and strongly expansionary monetary policy in the main developed countries.",
        "In the opinion of those members of the Council, as a result of the above factors inflation is expected to remain above the target for a longer time.",
        "Other members of the Council pointed out that should the recently observed decline in oil prices continue – especially amidst zloty strengthening – inflation might fall considerably by the end of 2012.",
        "In the opinion of those members of the Council, such a possibility was also indicated by considerably weaker producer price growth, suggesting that companies did not increase their margins.",
        "While addressing inflation expectations, it was emphasised that although one-year ahead inflation forecasts by financial sector analysts were consistent with the NBP’s inflation target, expectations of households and enterprises were largely based on current inflation.",
        "As a result, private sector’s expectations have continued, for a long time, well above the inflation target.",
        "Few members of the Council also argued that, notwithstanding still elevated unemployment rate, high inflation expectations persisting in the longer term increased the risk of their impact on contracts concluded by enterprises and consequently on the dynamics of the costs of production, including labour costs.",
        "In this context, attention was also paid to the announced minimum wage increase in 2013 as a factor likely to boost wage pressure.",
        "Other members of the Council emphasized that high inflation expectations had not so far translated into higher wage demands, which is evidenced by lowering growth in the wage bill.",
        "Few members of the Council pointed out that wage freeze in the public sector was conducive to limiting wage pressure in the whole economy.",
        "While discussing monetary policy stance, some members of the Council argued that despite the fact that heightened inflation was largely the result of factors beyond the impact of domestic monetary policy, when considering its negative consequences for the economy, efforts should be made to stabilise price growth at a low level.",
        "Those members pointed out that monetary policy should be pursued in such a way so as to support lowering of inflation expectations.",
        "Moreover, members of the Council emphasised that interest rate decisions should take into account, in the first place, expectations about macroeconomic developments over the period of 6-8 quarters.",
        "In the opinion of few members of the Council, over that horizon an acceleration in economic growth may be expected.",
        "Other members of the Council emphasised, however, that considering the fact that the currently heightened inflation was driven by supply factors, in order to curb inflation economic activity would have to fall below potential.",
        "On the other hand, excessively high interest rates might not only put a strong downward pressure on GDP growth over the next several quarters but also adversely affect domestic economic activity in the longer term.",
        "With regard to the decision on the NBP interest rates, the majority of Council members argued that the limited scale of the expected economic slowdown amidst heightened inflation persisting for over a year and its forecasted only slow decline over the coming quarters justified the NBP interest rate increase at the May meeting.",
        "In the opinion of those members of the Council, the outlook for inflation returning to the target had not improved since the last meeting, especially considering the persistently strong inflationary impact exerted by factors beyond the influence of domestic monetary policy and continuously heightened inflation expectations.",
        "At the same time, signals coming from the real economy did not clearly point to significant slowdown in economic activity in Poland.",
        "The majority of the Council members also emphasized that NBP interest rate increase was an adjustment to the current and anticipated macroeconomic situation in Poland and was aimed to ensure that real interest rates are kept above zero.",
        "At the same time, some members of the Council assessed that it might be necessary to adjust the NBP interest rates again in order to affect inflation expectations.",
        "Other members of the Council argued that it was still difficult to assess the scale of the anticipated economic slowdown and the decision about a possible adjustment of the NBP interest rates should be postponed.",
        "In the opinion of those members of the Council, only the data released in the coming months will enable the assessment whether economic slowdown in Poland will be strong or limited.",
        "Those members assessed that amidst high uncertainty about Poland’s external environment and continued fiscal tightening, it was justified to keep interest rates unchanged at the current meeting.",
        "A motion to raise the NBP interest rates by 25 basis points was put forward at the meeting.",
        "The Council decided to increase the NBP interest rates to the following levels: reference rate to 4.75%, lombard rate to 6.25%, deposit rate to 3.25%, rediscount rate to 5.00%.",
        "At its meeting, the Monetary Policy Council discussed the current and future monetary policy decisions against the background of external and domestic macroeconomic developments, including inflationary processes.",
        "While analysing developments in the external environment of the Polish economy, the Council members pointed to a moderate economic growth in the United States, stagnation in activity in the euro area and a weakening growth in several major emerging economies.",
        "While discussing the outlook for the euro area, the Council highlighted mounting concerns about the developments in the countries most affected by the sovereign debt crisis.",
        "Those concerns translated into deteriorating sentiment and rising risk aversion in the international financial markets.",
        "Weakening confidence has in turn resulted in depreciation of the exchange rates of the emerging currencies, including the zloty, and decrease of global commodity prices.",
        "Some Council members assessed that despite the deteriorating economic outlook for the euro area, GDP growth in Poland's main trading partners was set to remain firmly positive.",
        "However, these Council members also pointed out that the slowdown observed in major emerging economies, which are important recipients of German exports, might translate – through trade links between Poland and Germany – into further weakening in Polish exports.",
        "While addressing economic developments in Poland, it was pointed out that the data released in May, particularly concerning the GDP in 2012 Q1 and its composition, confirmed the gradual weakening in the Polish economic activity.",
        "The Council members pointed especially to a relatively slow consumption growth coupled with weakening investment and exports.",
        "Furthermore, in the opinion of some Council members, recent data on industrial production and retail sales, as well as a significant number of leading business climate indicators justify the expectation of slower GDP growth in 2012 Q2 in comparison to Q1.",
        "While addressing the outlook for growth in the subsequent quarters, some Council members stated that, apart from likely continued decline in external demand, the GDP growth will probably be further dampened by the on-going fiscal tightening, combined with a weaker consumption growth due to slow real wage growth and decelerating household lending.",
        "However, other members of the Council argued that the slowdown in the Polish economy may prove moderate.",
        "This could be indicated by some April data, in particular, further rise in the corporate investment lending and zloty-denominated mortgage lending, flattening downward trend in industrial production growth and an acceleration in construction and assembly output.",
        "At the same time, some Council members claimed that the increase in zloty-denominated mortgage lending was partly due to falling demand for foreign-currency mortgage lending.",
        "While discussing the prospects for lending expansion, few Council members highlighted that the deteriorating position of the euro area banking sector may to have an adverse effect on the credit supply by domestic banks.",
        "These Council members were of the opinion that credit supply may additionally be negatively affected by a decline of private sector deposits held in the banking sector seen over recent months, in part as a result of the deposits being transferred to the investment funds.",
        "Other Council members argued that amid persisting liquidity surplus in the banking sector, the above factors might not necessarily translate into weaker lending, as credit supply is far more responsive to the assessment of risks related to economic developments as well as changes in the credit standing of the potential borrowers.",
        "While analysing the labour market developments, some Council members pointed out that the LFS (Labour Force Survey) data for 2012 Q1 suggest slower annual growth of the employment in the economy, coupled with a rise in the unemployment rate compared to a year ago.",
        "Similar trends may be observed in the monthly data on employment in the enterprise sector and unemployment as registered by the Labour Offices.",
        "At the same time, wage growth accelerated somewhat in 2012 Q1, which – coupled with a simultaneous deceleration in GDP growth – added to an increase in unit labour costs in the economy.",
        "Yet, some Council members argued that the 2012 Q1 pick-up in wages might have been driven by one-off factors (i.e.",
        "expedited payments of some remuneration components before an increase in disability contributions).",
        "This may be corroborated by the corporate wage growth decelerating since February and running currently at low levels.",
        "In this context, some Council members assessed that the economy was not experiencing any intensification in wage pressures.",
        "In the opinion of few Council members, wage pressures were additionally mitigated with a wage freeze in the public sector.",
        "Other Council members emphasised, however, that for the last two years corporate sector had seen upward trend in labour costs.",
        "While discussing the risk of an increase in wage pressures, it was highlighted that inflation expectations were persisting at a relatively high level.",
        "Given their adaptive nature, they might also remain elevated in the coming months.",
        "Yet, some Council members assessed that the risk of the second-round effects was limited due to slowing employment growth and heightened unemployment.",
        "With reference to inflation developments, it was pointed out that April saw a rise in both the CPI and core inflation.",
        "It was also highlighted that the current elevated inflation was driven, to a great extent, by factors beyond the impact of the domestic monetary policy.",
        "On the other hand, some Council members pointed out that in comparison with other countries in the region – in which inflation was influenced by similar external factors – inflation in Poland remained relatively high.",
        "While discussing the short-term outlook for inflation, it was indicated that the nearest months might be expected to see inflation continue above the upper limit for deviations from the target.",
        "This will be driven by the sustained steep growth in administered prices, accompanied with accelerating annual food price growth.",
        "The sharp rise in administered prices is partially an effect of increased fees and prices controlled by the general government units.",
        "These increases were related to measures aimed at curbing the general government deficit.",
        "Amongst other factors raising inflation in Poland, the Council also mentioned the recently observed depreciation of the zloty related to deteriorating sentiment in the global markets as well as the risk of a temporary hike in restaurant and hotel prices in some cities connected to the European Football Cup.",
        "With regard to inflation trends in longer run, some Council members highlighted that some forecasts pointed to a risk of inflation remaining above the target for longer period.",
        "These Council members in particular pointed to the relatively high core inflation, which might continue to run at relatively high levels also in the subsequent quarters.",
        "This, given a low – in their opinion – likelihood of any substantial drop in growth of energy and food prices, would impede inflation returning to the target.",
        "Few Council members emphasised at this point that the recently observed decline in commodity prices might prove temporary, particularly amid political tensions in some major commodity economies.",
        "Other Council members indicated that the contribution of food and energy price growth to CPI inflation might decline substantially in the coming quarters, due to, in particular, favourable base effects for both categories.",
        "While analysing the current monetary policy, some Council members assessed that the current level of interest rates might be adequate to maintain price stability over the medium term, particularly considering the economic slowdown.",
        "At the same time, few Council members argued that any further interest rate increases may – through their dampening effect on demand growth – impede the reduction of the general government deficit in relation to the GDP, which in turn, by forcing additional fiscal adjustment, may ultimately result in an excessive curbing of economic growth.",
        "Yet, other Council members argued that – despite the already implemented adjustment – the current level of interest rates in Poland may prove slightly too low to stem the risk of inflation persisting at a heightened level over the medium term, given particularly the risk of persistently elevated core inflation.",
        "Few Council members pointed out that too low interest rates might negatively affect the saving rate in the economy.",
        "While discussing decisions on the NBP official interest rates, the Council members decided that these should be left unchanged at the current meeting.",
        "Some Council members emphasised that amidst the on-going economic slowdown, the increase of the NBP rates at the previous meeting was probably a sufficient adjustment of interest rates to the current and anticipated macroeconomic developments in Poland.",
        "Such an assessment is also supported – in their opinion – by the risk of deteriorating situation in the euro area economy.",
        "Other Council members believed that another interest rate adjustment might be justified in the coming period, should the expected period of inflation persisting above the target protract, and the scale of the anticipated economic slowdown prove moderate.",
        "In the opinion of most Council members, a more comprehensive assessment whether another interest rate increase was justified should take into account the data released in the coming period as well as results of the NECMOD projection and of other forecasts.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged at the following levels: reference rate at 4.75%, lombard rate at 6.25%, deposit rate at 3.25%, rediscount rate at 5.00%.",
        "At its meeting, the Monetary Policy Council discussed the current and future monetary policy decisions against the background of the external and domestic macroeconomic conditions, especially including inflation developments.",
        "While analysing external conditions for economic activity in Poland, Council members pointed out that the global activity remained low.",
        "In this context, it was indicated that economic growth in the United States was moderate and conditions in the euro area had weakened significantly, with continued recession and adverse outlook for this economic region.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that – despite the on-going recession in many euro area countries – the German economy, Poland's key trading partner, continued to grow, albeit at a slower pace.",
        "Economic slowdown in major emerging economies, which were hitherto relatively resilient to deteriorating economic growth outlook in advanced economies, was also emphasised.",
        "With regard to the situation in the global markets, Council members pointed to a sharp rise in energy and agricultural commodity prices, caused by disruptions on the supply side, and a further improvement in investor sentiment resulting from expectations for further monetary policy easing by the major central banks.",
        "Referring to the situation in Poland, Council members emphasised that recent data on economic activity, including GDP, as well as economic conditions indicators, pointed to a sharper deceleration in domestic economic growth this year than was assumed in the July projection and anticipated by external forecasters.",
        "Addressing the national accounts data for 2012 Q2, it was highlighted that economic slowdown was mainly attributable to a decline in domestic demand.",
        "Demand contraction was driven by both slower consumption growth as well as a sharp deceleration in investment spending growth in private sector and a decrease in general government investments.",
        "It was emphasised that the positive contribution of net exports to economic growth resulted from a fall in imports – on the back of a decrease in domestic demand – rather than a rise in exports.",
        "While discussing current conditions indicators, few Council members pointed out that retail sales growth in July was faster than in 2012 Q2 on average.",
        "Yet, other Council members highlighted that the monthly retail sales indicators, based solely on data from larger companies, i.e.",
        "with more than 9 employees, are not a good indicator for total household consumption expenditure.",
        "It was pointed out that also industrial production rose faster in July than in 2012 Q2 on average.",
        "However, at the same time construction and assembly production declined and downward trend in most leading indicators continued.",
        "Attention was also drawn to increasingly sluggish growth in lending, including investment loans, a rise in the number of entities lacking creditworthiness as well as deteriorating financial performance of companies, including falling revenues and deteriorating liquidity indicators.",
        "With reference to economic growth outlook in the subsequent quarters, some Council members emphasised that the structure of GDP growth in 2012 Q2 pointed to a possible further slowdown ahead.",
        "Downward revisions of external forecasts for economic growth also point to a higher probability of slower GDP growth next year.",
        "In the opinion of few Council members, there is a risk that economic growth in Poland in the second half of 2012 and 2013 may be substantially lower than forecast in the July projection and by the external forecasters.",
        "Yet, few Council members assessed that the observed slowdown may be only temporary and its scale will depend, to a large extent, on the situation in the external environment, which according to most forecasts will improve in 2013.",
        "In the opinion of Council members, economic growth will be particularly dampened by further weakening in domestic demand, which was the key driver of economic growth over recent years.",
        "Weaker domestic demand will probably result not only from a reduction in investment but also from a slowdown in private consumption growth.",
        "Investment will be reduced in the public sector amidst the fiscal tightening in place and – most likely – in the private sector due to weaker corporate expectations of future economic conditions.",
        "Consumption growth may be affected by lower disposable income growth triggered by deteriorating labour market conditions.",
        "In this context, it was pointed out that in 2012 Q2 and in July the unemployment rate was higher than a year before, and employment growth continued to slow down.",
        "With further reference to consumption outlook, it was observed that private consumption may also be adversely affected by deteriorating consumer confidence, decelerating household lending as well as the saving rate running close to zero.",
        "Few Council members pointed to an unfavourable phenomenon of a decrease in household deposits growth in the banking sector.",
        "While discussing inflation developments and short term inflation outlook, few Council members pointed out that – following a temporary rise in June – the CPI inflation in July had decreased more steeply than had been expected.",
        "Council members highlighted that the annual CPI may decline further in the coming months, in part due to a statistical base effect.",
        "At the same time, limited wage pressure reflected in moderate wage growth will drag on inflation.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members, towards the end of 2012, CPI inflation will run below the upper limit for deviations from the target.",
        "Yet, few Council members pointed out that despite a decrease expected by the end of 2012, inflation would probably remain elevated, while the pace at which the inflation would decrease in 2013 remained uncertain.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members, the increase in food commodity and oil prices observed over the past few months may pose an upside risk to inflation.",
        "At the same time, it was highlighted that the future levels of the zloty exchange rate and consequently its impact on inflation developments were highly uncertain.",
        "Few Council members pointed to a reduction in lending by foreign parent banks from their Polish subsidiaries.",
        "With regard to inflation trends in longer run, some Council members pointed out that the inflation could return to the target sooner than had been previously expected, which may be supported by deeper than envisaged economic slowdown.",
        "In the opinion of few Council members, despite a recent oil price increase, the annual CPI may be reduced in 2013, owing to a statistical base effect relating to a relatively high level of fuel prices in the first half of 2012.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members, in the first half of 2013, inflation will be probably close to the NBP inflation target (2.5%).",
        "Yet, other Council members pointed to substantial uncertainty regarding the magnitude of the impact of the economic slowdown on inflation, as well as the fact that despite the downward revision of the economic growth forecasts many external forecasts continue to expect inflation to stay above 2.5% in 2013.",
        "While considering monetary policy decisions, the majority of Council members judged that the NBP interest rates should be kept unchanged at the current meeting.",
        "In their opinion, this decision was justified by the uncertainty about the scale and duration of the economic slowdown, which would determine inflation developments over the monetary policy horizon.",
        "It was also highlighted that there was a risk of inflation persisting at heightened level in the subsequent months, which would be attributable to the observed rise in commodity prices in the global markets.",
        "At the same time, most Council members concluded that the information received since the previous meeting, i.e.",
        "about the deteriorating growth outlook in the euro area and sharper than expected deceleration in Polish GDP growth in 2012 Q2, had changed the view on the economic conditions, including the assessment of whether inflation would be above or below the target over the medium term.",
        "In the opinion of few Council members, data received since the previous meeting do not indicate that the NBP interest rates should be increased.",
        "However, they do not warrant their reduction either, as the real interest rate is tailored to the expectations of inflation returning to the target and expected moderate economic growth.",
        "However, in the opinion of some Council members, the risk of a deeper and longer than expected economic slowdown, along with the prospect of inflation returning to the target in 2013, may provide an argument in favour of lower interest rates in the subsequent months.",
        "Few Council members, in turn, were of the opinion that amidst the probably further substantial weakening business conditions and the resulting risk of inflation dropping below the target within the monetary policy horizon, and given a limited room for fiscal policy easing and persisting uncertainty about the situation in the euro area, monetary policy easing was justified already at the current meeting.",
        "As a result, the Council decided to consider a monetary policy adjustment, should the incoming data confirm a further slowdown and the risk for inflationary pressure mounting remain limited.",
        "The assessment of whether any interest rate adjustment was justified should take into account the data incoming in the coming period, as well as – in the opinion of some Council members – the results of the November NBP projection.",
        "A motion to decrease the basic NBP interest rates by 0.50 percentage point was submitted at the meeting.",
        "A motion was also submitted to decrease the basic NBP interest rates by 0.25 percentage point.",
        "The Council left the basic interest rates unchanged at the following levels: reference rate at 4.75%, lombard rate at 6.25%, deposit rate at 3.25%, rediscount rate at 5.00%.",
        "At its meeting, the Monetary Policy Council discussed current and future monetary policy decisions against the background of external and domestic macroeconomic developments, including inflationary processes and also the results of the July 2012 inflation projection.",
        "While analysing the external conditions of macroeconomic developments in Poland, the Council members pointed to the recently observed signs of weakening of the global economic activity.",
        "When addressing the economic developments in the United States, the Council members highlighted that the US GDP growth was moderate and might slow down in the subsequent quarters.",
        "When discussing the situation in the euro area, attention was drawn to the stagnation in this economy and the persisting uncertainty related to resolving the sovereign debt crisis faced by some euro area member states.",
        "Council members stressed that economic activity weakening – apparent in the euro area – was also observed in Germany, driven by economic slowdown in the largest emerging economies, which are major recipients of German exports.",
        "During the discussion, the Council pointed out that weakening of external economic activity, in particular in Germany, translated into a pronounced deceleration in Polish exports growth.",
        "At this point, few Council members argued that the situation of Polish exporters was diversified, as some exporting companies reported increasing sales.",
        "When discussing the situation in the financial markets, it was pointed out that growing concerns about the global economic activity had boosted investor expectations of further monetary policy easing by major central banks.",
        "At the same time, some Council members assessed that as a result of uncertainty about the scale and consequences of increased monetary expansion in major economies, improvement in sentiment observed recently in the global financial markets might be short-lived.",
        "Attention was also drawn to the continuing decline in commodity prices in the global markets.",
        "While analysing the situation in Poland, some Council members pointed out that the current data on economic activity as well as business climate indicators pointed to further slowdown in domestic economic growth.",
        "Those Council members stressed that growth in both industrial output and retail sales in 2012 Q2 had been significantly slower than in the previous quarters, and the aboveexpectations retail sales results in May could have been partly driven by the Euro 2012 football championship.",
        "According to those members of the Council, weaker business climate indicators about the expected economic conditions, in particular regarding outlook for demand, orders and production, were a sign of adverse prospects for domestic economic activity.",
        "Yet, few members of the Council expressed an opinion that the recently incoming data indicated rather a slight economic downturn.",
        "Those Council members pointed to some strengthening of industrial output and retail sales growth in May (that could be driven not only by one-off factors), a sustained strong financial standing of firms and an improvement in liquidity indicators in the corporate sector in 2012 Q2 – as showed by the NBP surveys.",
        "Few Council members argued that the relatively sound business conditions in Poland were reflected in further growth in lending, although credit supply might be adversely affected by worsening situation in the euro area.",
        "While assessing the GDP growth outlook in the subsequent quarters against the NBP July projection, some Council members emphasised that the projection envisaged further economic slowdown – deeper than forecast in the March projection.",
        "Growth is supposed to be dampened by further weakening in domestic and external demand.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members, weaker domestic demand will result from slower investment and private consumption growth, driven by the lack of improvement in the labour market, tighter lending conditions and earlier sharp fall in savings rate.",
        "Fiscal tightening and lower inflow of EU funds, the latter related primarily to cuts in public investment, may also contribute to weaker growth.",
        "At the same time, few Council members deemed economic growth in the coming years likely to run markedly below the levels assumed in the NBP projection.",
        "Other members of the Council assessed, however, that the impact of lower inflow of EU funds on GDP growth in 2013 would be relatively small.",
        "In their opinion, the effect of further fiscal tightening is also likely to be limited.",
        "At the same time, a simultaneous decline in inflation may – by increasing real disposable income – support consumption growth.",
        "As a consequence, following a marked slowdown this year, GDP growth may gradually pick up in the course of 2013.",
        "In this context, few Council members noted that the majority of currently available forecasts of external institutions suggested – in contrast to the NBP July projection – that the 2013 GDP growth might be higher than that observed in 2012.",
        "While discussing the risk of an increase in wage pressures, some Council members pointed out that the risk was limited, as evidenced by still moderate wage growth in the enterprise sector.",
        "The continued high unemployment rate was also highlighted as a factor preventing potential escalation of wage pressure.",
        "Yet, few Council members were of the opinion that amidst elevated inflation and the resulting growth in living costs, there was a risk of a rise in wage demands.",
        "While discussing inflationary developments, it was pointed out that CPI inflation in May was running substantially below the forecasts and approached the upper limit for deviations from the NBP target.",
        "Decline in core inflation was also highlighted.",
        "Yet, few Council members stressed that as compared with other EU countries – where inflation is influenced by similar external factors – inflation in Poland remained relatively high.",
        "While discussing short-term outlook for inflation, the members of the Council pointed to a likely rise in the CPI in the nearest months, resulting from the statistical base effect in food prices.",
        "In the immediate future, inflation may be also heightened by steeply rising administered prices, partially due to increases in charges and prices set by general government units.",
        "At the same time, it was noted that considerable uncertainty was related to the zloty exchange rate changes and its impact on inflationary processes.",
        "While discussing long-run inflation trends, some Council members pointed out that the July inflation projection was lower than the March projection, which means a faster than expected return of inflation to the target.",
        "According to the July projection, at the end of 2012 CPI inflation will be running below the upper limit for deviations from target, and may come close to the inflation target of 2.5% in the first half of 2013.",
        "Few Council members noted that towards the end of the inflation projection horizon, CPI inflation may even fall below 2.5%, though remaining within the limit for deviations from the target.",
        "Moreover, those Council members pointed that external forecasts are also suggesting a decline in inflation in 2013, down to a level close to the inflation target.",
        "Few Council members argued that in line with the July projection, however under the assumption that VAT rates are not reduced in 2014, core inflation will remain at a relatively high level, which might impede the return of CPI inflation to the target.",
        "Besides, in the opinion of these Council members, the economic slowdown is likely to be moderate and therefore no substantial decrease in inflationary pressures should be expected.",
        "While considering monetary policy decisions, the majority of Council members presented the opinion that – given the economic slowdown and the return of inflation to the target within a few quarters, as assumed in the July projection – the current level of the NBP interest rates is appropriate.",
        "Those Council members also argued that the interest rates adjustment implemented in May 2012 – being conducive to lower inflation – contributed to sustained macroeconomic stability of the domestic economy.",
        "In the opinion of those Council members, data and forecasts which had been released since the previous meeting of the Council did not provide grounds for further NBP interest rate increases, though they did not completely rule out the possibility of raising the NBP interest rates.",
        "According to those Council members, current or forecast macroeconomic situation did not justify interest rate cuts.",
        "In turn, few Council members assessed that the current level of the NBP interest rates – given the signs of a possible significant economic downturn and the risk of inflation falling below the target in the medium term – is too high and thus may lead to excessive deceleration of economic growth.",
        "These Council members also argued that interest rate reduction, by mitigating the slowdown in GDP growth, would support the currently implemented fiscal policy tightening.",
        "At the meeting, a motion to lower the NBP interest rates by 0.50 percentage point was put forward.",
        "The motion did not pass.",
        "Also a motion to lower the NBP interest rates by 0.25 percentage point was put forward.",
        "The motion did not pass.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged at the following levels: reference rate at 4.75%, lombard rate at 6.25%, deposit rate at 3.25%, rediscount rate at 5.00%.",
        "At its meeting, the Monetary Policy Council discussed the current and future monetary policy decisions against the background of external and domestic macroeconomic developments, including inflationary processes and the NBP’s March projection of inflation and GDP.",
        "While referring to the external conditions of the Polish economy, some members of the Council indicated that the recently published favourable data on the US and euro area economy supported optimistic sentiment in the global financial markets.",
        "Few members of the Council also pointed out that considering the current data, economic slowdown in the euro area might turn out less pronounced than previously expected.",
        "Other members of the Council emphasized that problems related to the fiscal crisis in the euro area had not been solved yet, and implementation of the fiscal package would be a long-term process.",
        "This means that should fiscal problems in some euro area countries escalate again, improved sentiment in the financial markets might prove short-lived and the outlook for economic growth in the euro area worse than currently anticipated.",
        "As regards the outlook for economic growth, those members of the Council drew particular attention to the lack of prospects for revival in lending by European banks despite a considerable liquidity provision by the European Central Bank.",
        "While discussing the monetary policy of major central banks, members of the Council pointed to their continued monetary expansion through increasing liquidity provision to the financial system, even though inflation in the United States, the euro area and Great Britain is running markedly above the target.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members, expansionary monetary policy will fuel price pressure.",
        "Data on economic activity in Poland, including data on output, retail sales and corporate lending, indicate that GDP growth in 2012 Q1 may continue at a relatively high level.",
        "At the same time, however, members of the Council emphasized that according to the forecasts for subsequent quarters, considering the relatively low level of most leading economic indicators, domestic economic growth, and, in particular, consumption are to weaken.",
        "It was also pointed out that consumption weakening may be partly driven by the observed lower lending to households.",
        "Moreover, some members of the Council indicated that the appreciation of the zloty exchange rate, affecting primarily import volume, would lead to lower contribution of net exports to GDP growth.",
        "Few members of the Council emphasized that in line with the NBP’s March projection, despite the forecast considerable slowdown in domestic economic activity, output gap might remain positive till the end of projection horizon.",
        "Likewise, throughout the projection horizon unemployment rate was supposed to run below the equilibrium unemployment rate as estimated in the NECMOD model.",
        "However, other members of the Council emphasized that both potential output and equilibrium unemployment rate were non-observable variables, and therefore their estimates as well as conclusions regarding the condition of the economy based on them should be read with caution.",
        "While addressing the situation in the labour market, members of the Council pointed out that the January data on employment and wages in the enterprise sector might be considerably distorted by temporary factors.",
        "Some members of the Council assessed that the persistently elevated unemployment had a mitigating effect on wage pressure, and, consequently, inflationary pressure.",
        "Other members of the Council argued that moderate wage growth in the recent period, combined with heightened inflation observed for more than a year now, increasing household maintenance costs, posed a risk of higher wage pressure.",
        "Few members of the Council also claimed that the observed moderate wage growth had been largely driven by rising labour supply, and, the anticipated halting of labour supply growth might consequently add to wage pressure.",
        "While analysing the inflationary developments, some members of the Council emphasized that decline in January inflation was more pronounced than had been forecast, and in the absence of zloty depreciation, inflation might be expected to decrease further by the end of the year.",
        "Those Council members also pointed to lowering core inflation in January 2012.",
        "Other members of the Council indicated, however, that despite some decline, inflation continued to run considerably above the target as well as above the upper limit for deviations from the target, and in line with the NBP’s March projection, inflation was also likely to remain above 3.5% in a oneyear horizon.",
        "Moreover, in comparison with the November 2011 projection, the period during which inflation is forecast to remain at a heightened level had been extended.",
        "Those members of the Council additionally emphasized that by the end of the projection horizon, core inflation was also to continue at a relatively high level.",
        "In the opinion of those Council members, growth in the prices of energy commodities in the global markets and the effects of implementing the EU climate and energy package continue to be risk factors for a marked decrease in inflation.",
        "Those Council members also indicated that it was difficult to assess the likelihood of reductions in VAT rates in 2014.",
        "Some members of the Council argued that interest rates were currently at a relatively low level, considering the macroeconomic situation in Poland, and even assuming for the possibility of a decline in the natural interest rate driven by the global financial crisis.",
        "Those Council members also assessed that high growth in monetary aggregates pointed to a merely slight decline in the natural interest rate in Poland.",
        "In the opinion of those Council members, low interest rates posed a risk of rising inefficiency in the economy.",
        "Yet, other members of the Council indicated that amidst growing monetary expansion abroad, keeping the NBP interest rates unchanged, additionally accompanied by a rise in WIBOR 3M rate in October 2011, and zloty appreciation at the beginning of the year, would mean a relative tightening of monetary policy in Poland.",
        "While discussing the decision on the NBP interest rates, members of the Council agreed that, given the heightened uncertainty about the global and domestic economic developments, it was justified to keep NBP interest rates unchanged at the current meeting.",
        "As regards future monetary policy decisions, the majority of the Council members maintained their view that NBP interest rates increase in the subsequent months could not be ruled out.",
        "Some members of the Council argued that – should the expected economic slowdown in Poland prove less pronounced than previously anticipated and, consequently, should the prospects of inflation returning to the target fail to improve – keeping the NBP interest rates unchanged could be conducive to both inflation expectations and inflation persisting at the elevated levels.",
        "At the same time, in the opinion of few members of the Council, a possible rise in the NBP interest rates in the subsequent months – amidst the expected weakening of economic activity abroad and in Poland – posed a risk that such monetary policy tightening would lead to an excessive weakening of demand in the Polish economy.",
        "Some members of the Council assessed that the NBP interest rates should be increased if the already visible decline in inflation was proceeding too slowly.",
        "In the opinion of those Council members, a decision to increase the NBP interest rates, if any, should depend on the pace of inflation decline in subsequent months and performance of the real sphere of the Polish economy.",
        "On the other hand, few members of the Council indicated that considering the NBP’s March projection of inflation and its balance of risks, in mid-2013 inflation should come close to the target and in 2014 it should run markedly below the target.",
        "Thus, the NBP interest rates increases might not be justified.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged at the following levels: reference rate at 4.50%, lombard rate at 6.00%, deposit rate at 3.00% and rediscount rate at 4.75%.",
        "At its meeting, the Monetary Policy Council discussed current and future monetary policy decisions against the background of expected growth and inflation trends in Poland, which will be strongly affected by both external conditions (growth outlook abroad, situation in the financial markets, commodity prices) and domestic factors, as well as the exchange rate developments.",
        "While analysing the situation in the Polish economy, the members of the Council pointed out that current data on industrial output, construction and assembly output and retail sales indicate that growth continues to be relatively strong.",
        "Few members of the Council also highlighted a stable rise in loans - despite prior interest rate increases - as a sign of relatively good business conditions still prevailing.",
        "At the same time, it was emphasised that in the coming quarters, a slowdown in economic activity at home can be expected.",
        "It was pointed out that uncertainty related to the external environment of the Polish economy, including the scale of the slowdown abroad and potential impact of the turmoil in the global financial markets on the Polish economy, combined with the uncertain pace and structure of further fiscal tightening at home, make it difficult to assess how strong the deceleration in the growth of demand in Poland would be.",
        "While discussing the external conditions of the domestic economic climate, members of the Council indicated that tensions in the financial markets resulting from the sovereign debt crisis in the euro area persist, and growth forecasts for the region continue to be revised downwards.",
        "Few members of the Council emphasised the risk of heavy lending constrains in the euro area countries, which would further deteriorate growth outlook for the region.",
        "Other members of the Council, however, assessed the risk of further marked weakening in growth forecasts for the euro area as limited, in particular for countries being Poland's main trading partners.",
        "In the opinion of few members of the Council, tensions in the European banking system may translate into constraints on lending in Poland.",
        "However, with reference to the risk that foreign banks might curb the funding for lending purposes in Poland, other members of the Council assessed it to be small, and given the significant number of enterprises financing themselves from their own funds or directly from abroad, possible constraints on lending imposed by domestic banks should not significantly undermine enterprises' activity in Poland.",
        "Referring to the outlook for foreign trade, some members of the Council argued that a weaker zloty would alleviate the effects of the decreasing foreign demand for Polish goods by improving their price competitiveness.",
        "Other members of the Council pointed out that due to a large share of intracorporate trade in Polish exports, the volume of foreign trade is hardly sensitive to exchange rate fluctuations.",
        "Most members of the Council assessed, however, that in the subsequent quarters Poland's trade balance should improve and net exports should contribute positively to GDP growth.",
        "In the opinion of some members of the Council, a slowdown in economic activity in Poland may be weaker than previously expected, as output growth remains relatively stable in spite of a decline in the leading business climate indicators.",
        "Moreover a continued rise in investment loans to enterprises and a steep growth in mortgage loans to households additionally support this opinion.",
        "Those members of the Council also pointed out that activity in the euro area will be the weakest in the countries most severely affected by the debt crisis, whose links with the Polish economy are not particularly close.",
        "They also emphasised that in the previous years, the Polish economy developed at a relatively fast rate even in the face of sluggish growth in the euro area.",
        "Few members of the Council indicated, instead, that the economic slowdown in Poland may be more severe than previously anticipated.",
        "In the opinion of those members of the Council, this scenario is supported by worsening investment outlook of enterprises combined with the expected weakening in the public sector investment activity.",
        "At the same time, other element of fiscal tightening - the freeze on wages in the government sector - will curtail the growth of consumption.",
        "A similar effect will be brought about by unemployment rate persisting at an elevated level, which may dampen wage growth throughout the economy.",
        "When discussing inflationary developments, attention was drawn to a higher than expected rise in inflation in November 2011 and an upward revision of inflation forecasts for the coming year, both resulting to a large degree from the hitherto depreciation of the zloty.",
        "It was pointed out that the persisting elevated inflation was accompanied by a considerable rise in inflation expectations of individuals and enterprises.",
        "Some members of the Council emphasised that while inflation should gradually decrease over the coming months, it would probably remain above the NBP target for a longer time than hitherto envisaged.",
        "Increases in the rates of indirect taxes and in administered prices were indicated as the factors continuously contributing to rising inflation.",
        "Moreover, few members of the Council additionally pointed out that unit labour costs might limit inflationary pressure to a lesser extent than in the previous years.",
        "In their opinion, a significant increase in minimum wages, a rise in disability pension contribution and the rising percentage of long-term unemployed - who are less competitive as compared with employees and those actively seeking jobs - combined with decreasing labour productivity resulting from the expected deterioration in business climate, will trigger a higher growth in unit labour costs.",
        "Referring to the external conditions for inflationary processes, few members of the Council emphasised that in the medium term a significant curbing of inflation in Poland would be made difficult by the persistently elevated inflation abroad and continuously high commodity prices in the global markets, related - in their opinion – to strongly expansionary monetary policy pursued by major central banks, including considerable excess liquidity in the global financial markets.",
        "Apart from expansionary monetary policy, high commodity prices will be also supported by: continued growth in demand from the developing countries and a possible mounting of political tensions in the commodity-exporting countries.",
        "According to those members of the Council, a lowering of inflation at home will be additionally made difficult by weaker anti-inflationary impact of imports from low-cost countries, where rate of growth of labour costs exceeds that of labour productivity and a relative appreciation of their currencies follows.",
        "As regards the monetary policy decisions implemented so far, the members of the Council assessed that the NBP interest rate increases in the first half of 2011 and the following stabilisation of monetary policy parameters in the second half of 2011 have been conducive to maintaining macroeconomic stability.",
        "In the last months of 2011, earlier signs of significant economic slowdown in Poland were not confirmed, while inflation increased, thus adding to the risk of inflation persisting above the target.",
        "Few members of the Council additionally pointed out that although the NBP interest rates remained unchanged, the depreciating exchange rate and rising inflation have resulted in easier monetary conditions in the recent months.",
        "While discussing the decision on the NBP interest rates, the members of the Council agreed they should remain unchanged at the current meeting.",
        "As a main argument in favour of this decision a high uncertainty of economic activity in the coming quarters was mentioned.",
        "With reference to future monetary policy decisions, on the other hand, most members of the Council were of the opinion that should the relatively fast domestic growth, elevated inflation and high inflation expectations continue, the increase in NBP interest rates cannot be ruled out.",
        "It was pointed out that in assessing the outlook for medium-term growth and inflation, the incoming data on economic activity and inflationary processes in Poland in the coming months as well as the NBP March projection would be helpful.",
        "Most members of the Council emphasised that a possible future decision to raise the NBP interest rates would be justified if the economic activity were to decelerate only slightly and inflation were not be in a clear downward trend.",
        "An important argument in favour of such a decision would also be the end of downward revisions of the euro area growth forecasts.",
        "Moreover, those members of the Council pointed out that future decisions on monetary policy would be greatly affected by the assessment of the implementation of further fiscal tightening.",
        "At the same time, few members of the Council argued that in case of a considerable economic slowdown or a significant appreciation of the zloty, a cut in the NBP interest rates may prove justified.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged at the following levels: reference rate at 4.5%, lombard rate at 6.00%, deposit rate at 3.00%, rediscount rate at 4.75%."

        "During the meeting the Monetary Policy Council discussed the outlook for the future inflation developments in the context of the past, current and, primarily, anticipated economic situation.",
        "The discussion at the meeting focused on: current inflation developments, including changes in administered prices and food prices, situation in the labour market, exchange rate developments, the outlook for economic growth and the level of interest rates in Poland and abroad.",
        "The Council discussed the influence of these factors on the future inflation in Poland.",
        "While commenting on the current inflation, the Council analysed the reasons behind a slight decline in annual consumer price growth in March, which, however, remained above the upper limit for deviations from the NBP’s inflation target set at 3.5%.",
        "It was argued that the fact that annual CPI inflation proved lower than in February followed from some decline in the annual food and fuel price growth.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that net core inflation increased in March, mainly due to a further acceleration in administered prices (prices of services connected with flat or house maintenance and some other services) and also because of an unexpected increase in prices of clothing and footwear.",
        "Some members of the Council emphasised that the heightened annual consumer price growth was mainly sustained by the continuing, despite some decrease, of the high growth of food and fuel prices and also by rises in administered prices in 2008 Q1.",
        "Those members also pointed out that the heightened inflation was also observed in many other countries and stressed that in Poland its level was lower than in other Central and Eastern European countries.",
        "While discussing the outlook for inflation in 2008-2009, it was pointed out that rising administered prices, especially those of energy and natural gas, would be a factor increasing inflation.",
        "Some Council members underlined that rises in administered prices, combined with the previously observed strong increases in food and fuel prices, might translate into a rise in perceived inflation and thus also boost inflationary expectations.",
        "Those members pointed out that the surveys of inflation expectations of households in April revealed an increase in the percentage of respondents expecting inflation to stabilise at its current high level or to rise further.",
        "In this context, they pointed out that the monetary policy should account for the related increased risk of second-round effects.",
        "Moreover, some Council members assessed that the increased growth of the prices of clothing and footwear in March may be signalling a weakening in the disinflationary impact of globalisation processes and intensified competition in the market of internationally traded goods on the Polish economy.",
        "Other members of the Council, however, believed that it was difficult to assess at the moment whether the increased growth of clothing and footwear prices would indeed prove permanent.",
        "While discussing the path of food prices, it was assessed that the high growth of these prices observed since the second half of 2007 would most probably ease in the months to come, which was indicated, among others, by the prices of futures contracts in the world food markets and the positive forecast of this year's harvest in Poland and other European countries.",
        "Some Council members emphasised that high current inflation and the already introduced and expected rises of administered prices might be of importance for Poland as regards its compliance with the Maastricht price stability criterion.",
        "In this context, the Council members pointed to the need to appropriately coordinate the fiscal and monetary policies in the period preceding Poland’s accession to the euro area.",
        "While analysing developments in the environment of the Polish economy, it was pointed out that the symptoms of a slowdown in the United States had deepened and the activity in some Western European economies had lowered.",
        "It was stressed that there had been a downward revision of growth forecasts for the global economy in 2008-2009, particularly the forecasts for the United States and the euro area.",
        "Some Council members emphasised that the appreciation of the euro against the US dollar and pound sterling observed over the past months was a factor strengthening the negative impact that the economic slowdown in the United States and the United Kingdom had on GDP growth in the euro area.",
        "They assessed that the deceleration of economic growth in Western European countries, in combination with the zloty appreciation observed over the past months, may be lowering the growth rate of Polish exports and, consequently, have a negative impact on GDP growth in Poland.",
        "They also argued that the weakening of the foreign demand might persuade enterprises to limit their investment, which would additionally decrease GDP growth.",
        "While assessing the outlook for economic growth in Poland, it was pointed out that the growth of industrial output and retail sales in March was lower than in the previous two months and significantly below expectations.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members those data may be a signal of reduced activity in the Polish economy in the coming period.",
        "Other members of the Council believed that it was difficult to assess at the moment whether the weaker than expected data for March indeed suggested a weakening economic growth.",
        "Those members argued that the low industrial output growth in March could have been connected with the Easter holiday break and the growing propensity of Poles to take more days off work in the holiday period.",
        "They pointed to the results of business confidence surveys, according to which the overall economic sentiment in Poland was still good.",
        "In the assessment of those Council members, the extent of a possible decline in economic growth in Poland would be significantly smaller than in the United States or the euro-area.",
        "While addressing the situation in the labour market, it was pointed out that the wage and employment growth in the enterprise sector in March was still high, which was conducive to increasing the demand pressure.",
        "It was emphasised that wage growth was still exceeding productivity growth, resulting in a further rise in unit labour costs.",
        "Some Council members, however, pointed to the fact that the continuously high growth of wages would be conducive to deteriorating the financial standing of enterprises, which would make further high pay rises impossible.",
        "Moreover, some Council members argued that the wage pressure in the coming period may in fact be easing due to a probable reduction in the scale of economic emigration of Poles, connected with weaker economic growth and worsening situation in the labour markets of Western European countries, particularly the United Kingdom and Ireland.",
        "They pointed out that the scale of emigration may be reduced by the zloty exchange rate appreciation observed over the last months which decreased the zloty value of income of Poles working abroad.",
        "Some Council members argued that, apart from high wage growth, domestic demand may be additionally driven by growth in credit aggregates, including consumption loans granted to households, which continued at a high level.",
        "Other members of the Council underlined that since the beginning of 2008 the deposits of households had been increasing rapidly, which might suggest an increased propensity to save and be conducive to easing the demand pressure.",
        "Moreover, they also argued that the positive balance of the central government budget in 2008 Q1 was additionally lowering the demand pressure.",
        "While discussing the exchange rate developments, it was pointed out that in April the zloty exchange rate appreciated significantly both against the US dollar and against the euro and was stronger than accounted for in the February inflation projection.",
        "It was underlined that the zloty exchange rate appreciation was conducive to easing the domestic inflationary pressure, as it resulted in a reduction of prices of imported goods expressed in the zloty, and particularly that it weakened the impact of high fuel price growth in the world markets on the Polish economy.",
        "At the same time, however, some Council members pointed out that the zloty appreciation also reduced the zloty denominated value of EU structural funds allocated for the financing of investment projects, which may impede the implementation of those projects and lead to lowering investment growth.",
        "While discussing monetary policy, some Council members stressed that against the background of other countries of the region the level of real interest rates in Poland was relatively high and that the monetary policy tightening in recent months had been effected at a relatively fast pace.",
        "Those members pointed out that some central banks had lowered their interest rates over the past months despite the persistently high inflation in those countries, and stressed that the appreciation of the real zloty exchange rate was additionally increasing the restrictiveness of monetary policy in Poland.",
        "They argued that a further monetary policy tightening in Poland would increase interest rate disparity between Poland on the one hand and the United States and the euro area on the other, which might encourage the inflow of short-term capital to Poland and be conducive to excessive zloty exchange rate appreciation.",
        "In the opinion of those members, this would weaken the competitiveness of the Polish economy and reduce the profitability of export production and thus would lead to further deepening of external imbalance.",
        "Other members of the Council, however, argued that, due to a large import intensity of export production, the zloty exchange rate appreciation did not significantly reduce the profits of exporters, which may be confirmed, among others, by the data on the financial results of enterprises in 2007.",
        "Moreover, some Council members thought that it was currently difficult to assess the sustainability of the factors which had led to the recent appreciation of the zloty.",
        "Some members of the Council also assessed that a rise in interest rate disparity would be increasing the share of loans denominated in foreign currencies in total loans, which might weaken the impact of domestic monetary policy on domestic demand.",
        "They pointed out that since the beginning of 2008 an increase had been observed in the share of housing loans denominated in foreign currencies in the total housing loan debt of individuals.",
        "While discussing the interest rate decision, the Council assessed that the continuing high growth of wages and employment, along with the possibility of increased inflation expectations resulting from higher current inflation and the expected further increase of administered prices, both pointed to the risk of inflation remaining above the inflation target in the medium term.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members, these factors justified an interest rate increase already at the April meeting.",
        "In the opinion of the majority of the Council, however, the risk of a decrease in economic growth in Poland and of an excessive appreciation of the zloty exchange rate, both of which would be reducing inflation in the medium term, justified no interest rate change at the current meeting.",
        "A motion to raise the key NBP interest rates by 25 basis points was put forward at the meeting.",
        "The motion did not pass.",
        "The Council kept the interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 5.75%, the lombard rate at 7.25%, the deposit rate at 4.25% and the rediscount rate at 6.00%.",
        "During the meeting the Monetary Policy Council discussed the outlook for inflation in the context of the past, current and, primarily, anticipated economic situation.",
        "The discussion at the meeting focused on: the outlook for economic growth and inflation in Poland, credit market conditions and zloty exchange rate developments.",
        "While addressing the situation in the external environment of the Polish economy, a further deterioration in the outlook for global economic growth, and in particular, the deepening recession in the United States and the euro area, was noted.",
        "It was emphasised that the developments in the global economy were conducive to faster than previously expected decline in inflation in many economies, inter alia, as a result of the fall in commodity prices, including oil prices.",
        "It was pointed out that those factors urged many central banks, in particular banks of countries that are in recession, to further considerable easing of the monetary policy.",
        "The Council paid a lot of attention to the outlook for economic growth in Poland.",
        "It was emphasised that unfavourable developments in the external environment of the Polish economy brought about stronger than previously expected decline in activity in the Polish economy which was corroborated by weaker than anticipated November data on industrial and construction output.",
        "Among major channels through which the world crisis affected the Polish economy were listed: the decline in external demand, deteriorating agents’ expectations as to the future economic situation of the country and tightening of banks’ lending policy.",
        "It was pointed out that the coming quarters might be expected to bring about a strong drop in corporate investment being largely the result of economic slowdown and deterioration in the outlook for sales in the domestic and foreign markets as well as a more difficult access of enterprises to loans both in Polish zloty and foreign currencies.",
        "Considerable weakening of investment demand will also be driven by such factors as deteriorating financial results of enterprises, limited possibilities of business financing through the capital market and a probable decline in the inflow of foreign direct investment to Poland.",
        "It was also stressed that as a result of the tightening of banks’ lending policy, small and medium-sized enterprises might face problems with the absorption of EU funds for investment projects due to the need to contribute own funds.",
        "It was emphasised that GDP data for 2008 Q3 pointed to a considerably stronger than anticipated fall in investment growth.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that the annual investment growth in the enterprise sector in 2008 Q3 was negative, and investment growth in the economy resulted from the continued relatively high growth in investment expenditure of the public finance sector and in housing investment.",
        "It was assessed that in 2008 Q4 the investment contribution to GDP growth could be close to zero and in the first half of 2009 it might turn negative.",
        "While discussing the future economic situation it was assessed that the slowdown in economic growth would also be driven by a decline in consumption and export growth, and GDP growth in 2008 Q4 and in subsequent quarters would most probably be lower than anticipated in the NBP’s October projection.",
        "It was pointed out that the decline in the growth of Polish exports might be stronger than the one recorded in the previous periods of economic slowdown in the external  Warszawa ulica Świętokrzyska telefon (22)  55  (22)  51 environment of the Polish economy due to the fact that in the past few years, the corporate links between Polish and foreign companies intensified and the share of highly processed goods sensitive to business cycle fluctuations in the Polish export production increased.",
        "Moreover, it was argued that contrary to previous expectations the consumption demand might also weaken considerably which was suggested by worse than expected November data on retail sales.",
        "The decline in private consumption growth will be driven by the anticipated deterioration of the labour market situation indicated by the November data on the declining wage growth and falling employment in the enterprise sector and increasing unemployment as well as tightening of household lending criteria.",
        "It was argued that limited access to credit would have a stronger impact on consumption demand than in the previous periods of the economic slowdown as the past few years had been marked by growing importance of credit in financing household consumption.",
        "Moreover, deterioration in the housing market situation related, among other things, to the tightening of conditions and criteria of granting mortgage loans, will contribute to the decline in demand for home furnishing goods and services.",
        "Among factors having a negative impact on consumption demand were also listed: deteriorating consumer sentiment and decreasing purchasing power of households’ incomes driven by increases in administered prices.",
        "While discussing the outlook for inflation it was assessed that in the time to come the growth in consumer prices would continue to decline and would be within the tolerance range for deviations from the inflation target, thus running below the level forecast in the NBP’s October inflation projection.",
        "Lower than forecast inflation in the near term will be mainly driven by lower than assumed commodity prices in the global markets, including oil and gas prices.",
        "In the medium term, the lowering of inflationary pressure will be driven by: stronger than previously expected decline in the global and domestic economic growth, low inflation in the external environment of the Polish economy translating into declining growth in the prices of import goods and faster than anticipated in the projection weakening of wage pressure connected with falling labour demand and increased labour supply, inter alia, as a result of intensified return of Poles from the economic migration.",
        "Moreover, some members of the Council indicated that amidst the economic slowdown the previously observed increase in unit labour costs would translate into prices only to a limited extent.",
        "Attention was also paid to the stronger than expected decline in CPI inflation in November.",
        "Among factors curbing the decline in inflation, in turn, were listed: further rise in administered prices, increases in excise tax on certain products and depreciation of the zloty exchange rate observed in the past few months.",
        "Yet, some members of the Council pointed out that the impact of the exchange rate weakening on prices amidst economic slowdown would probably be limited.",
        "While addressing the exchange rate developments, it was stressed that the considerable zloty depreciation against the euro and the US dollar and increased exchange rate volatility observed in the past few months resulted mainly from the increase in risk aversion in the global financial markets leading to capital outflow from the emerging markets.",
        "Some members of the Council argued that the appreciation of the zloty exchange rate in the first half of 2008 and its subsequent depreciation could be reinforced by Polish enterprises concluding structured foreign exchange contracts.",
        "In this context, it was pointed out that the exchange rate depreciation in the second half of 2008 contributed to the deterioration of the financial situation of certain enterprises which might additionally limit the investment of these enterprises.",
        "Some members of the Council pointed out that the exchange rate depreciation resulted in increasing the value of public debt denominated in foreign currencies and, consequently, the relation of debt to GDP which, due to statutory restrictions, might make it necessary to limit the expenditure of the public finance sector in the coming years.",
        "Yet, other members of the Council pointed out that the share of debt denominated in foreign currencies in the total public debt was considerably lower than the share of debt in Polish zloty.",
        "On the other hand, as the favourable consequence of the zloty exchange rate depreciation it was noted that it was increasing the competitiveness of Polish products on foreign markets which would limit the impact of recession in countries being Poland’s major trading partners on the growth of Polish exports.",
        "While analysing the situation in the credit market it was pointed out that the tightening of banks’ lending policy and continued increased level of market interest rates as compared with the NBP rates were related to liquidity disturbances in the banking system being the result of the crisis in the global financial markets.",
        "It was argued that commercial banks’ operations aimed at increasing the liquidity – reduction of lending and offering of high interest rates on deposits – would contribute to limiting the domestic demand in the time to come.",
        "It was also pointed out that too high interest rates on deposits might result in deteriorating financial results of banks and, consequently, constitute a factor limiting future lending.",
        "It was pointed out that this effect was not yet observed in the monetary data showing that loans continued to grow relatively fast in November.",
        "Some members of the Council argued that the continued growth in corporate loans in November might be driven by the fact that enterprises, fearing the further tightening of banks’ lending policy, tried to use the available credit lines.",
        "The Council also discussed the actions of the NBP and the government that could counteract the reduction of banks’ lending.",
        "It was argued that this objective would be supported by the government loan guarantee system, concerning in particular corporate loans, including loans taken for projects financed with UE funds.",
        "It was pointed out that due to liquidity problems faced by banks possible lowering of the NBP interest rates might not fully translate into reductions of market interest rates.",
        "In the opinion of some discussants this was an argument speaking in favour of considerable decreases in the NBP interest rates.",
        "Other members of the Council argued that even strong decreases in the interest rates would not increase loan availability or reduce credit costs since those depend on banks’ liquidity situation and households’ and entrepreneurs’ expectations as to the future situation of the Polish economy.",
        "While discussing the decision on interest rates, the Council assessed that the signs of stronger and faster than expected decline in the global and Polish economic activity combined with considerable lowering of the inflationary pressure in the medium term speak for decreasing the NBP interest rates.",
        "Some members of the Council expressed the opinion that easing of the monetary policy should be implemented gradually, inter alia, due to the high uncertainty about the outlook for the global and Polish economy and about the impact of cuts in the NBP interest rates on market interest rates and domestic demand.",
        "They argued that too strong a lowering of the NBP interest rates might negatively affect the expectations of the financial market participants as regards the outlook for the Polish economy, thus driving further exchange rate depreciation.",
        "Some members of the Council assessed, however, that in the current situation the impact of the interest rate disparity on the exchange rate was limited.",
        "The majority of the Council members assessed that the scale of economic slowdown in Poland and the increased credit cost resulting from market interest rates continuing well above the level of the NBP reference rate combined with the marked weakening of the inflationary pressure justified a considerable easing of the monetary policy at the December meeting.",
        "Those members argued that insufficient response of the monetary policy to the unfavourable developments in the Polish economy might contribute to intensifying those developments and, as a result – through deteriorating expectations of the financial market participants – be conducive to the weakening and increased volatility of the zloty exchange rate.",
        "They assessed that a more significant lowering of the NBP interest rates would counteract the reduction of bank lending and, consequently, the excessive weakening of domestic demand, and that it would also reduce the cost of credit, including the cost of servicing the previously contracted loans, which could additionally reduce the share of the so-called bad debts, thus contributing to increased stability of the financial system.",
        "They also pointed out that maintaining the public finance discipline despite the economic slowdown declared by representatives of the government constituted an additional factor favouring the easing of the monetary policy.",
        "The Council also discussed the scale of possible further lowering of the NBP interest rates.",
        "A motion to lower the NBP interest rates by 50 basis points and a motion to lower the NBP interest rates by 75 basis points were put forward.",
        "The motion to lower the NBP interest rates by 75 basis points was passed, therefore the motion to lower the NBP interest rates by 50 basis points was not put to voting.",
        "The Council decided to lower the NBP interest rates to the level: the reference rate to 5.00%, the lombard rate to 6.50%, the deposit rate to 3.50% and the rediscount rate to 5.25%.",
        "During the meeting the Monetary Policy Council discussed the outlook for the future inflation developments in the context of the past, current and, primarily, anticipated economic situation.",
        "The discussion at the meeting focused on: situation in the external environment of the Polish economy, outlook for economic growth in Poland, situation in the labour market and the prospects of Poland’s entry to the euro area.",
        "The Council discussed the impact of those factors on future inflation developments in Poland in view of the October projection of inflation and GDP.",
        "While discussing the situation in the external environment of the Polish economy, further considerable deterioration in the outlook for economic growth in the global economy was noted.",
        "It was emphasised that the crisis of the financial sector in the United States contributed to intensifying unfavourable developments in the real economy of that country.",
        "Attention was also paid to considerable deterioration of economic climate in Great Britain and strong slowdown in economic activity in the euro area as well as considerable lowering of growth forecasts for the euro area’s economy.",
        "Moreover, it was emphasised that in the time to come the weakening of the economic activity would be experienced not only in the developed but also in developing economies, including Asian and Latin American countries.",
        "In the case of economies exporting commodities, an important factor conducive to lower economic growth would be the decline in the value of their exports caused by falling commodity prices, whereas the decline in economic activity in the emerging economies which import commodities might additionally contribute to the lowering of prices of those commodities.",
        "It was pointed out that the slowdown in global economic activity curbed inflationary pressure, prompting central banks of many countries to ease their monetary policy.",
        "The Council paid a lot of attention to the impact of the weakened global economy and the turmoil in the global financial markets on the outlook for economic growth in Poland.",
        "It was pointed out that the recession in the euro area, which is Poland’s main trading partner, would lead to the lowering of demand for Polish exports.",
        "It was emphasised that deteriorating growth outlook in the global economy and the increased uncertainty in the external environment might – despite still relatively good condition of the Polish economy – contribute to the worsening of households’ expectations of the future economic situation in Poland and, as a result, to the weakening of consumption demand.",
        "It was also argued that the drop in the value of households’ assets being the result of the downturn in the financial markets might additionally dampen the consumption growth.",
        "It was also pointed out that changes in the external environment of the Polish economy might adversely affect the investment activity of enterprises in Poland.",
        "Investment growth may slow down primarily due to worsening entrepreneurs’ expectations concerning the future demand in the foreign and domestic markets.",
        "Moreover, it was emphasised that the rise in risk premium driven by the turmoil in the international financial markets had led to a rise in market interest rates in Poland, and, consequently, to an increase in the cost of credit, which would also contribute to the weakening of investment growth in the time to come.",
        "Difficulties in acquiring capital for new investment, related to falling share prices in the capital markets, may also have the same effect.",
        "Attention was also drawn to further tightening of loan granting criteria by banks.",
        "A possible decrease in the inflow of foreign direct investment to Poland and deteriorating outlook for the financing of enterprises with foreign loans were also listed among adverse effects of the weakening world economy and the crisis in the global financial markets.",
        "While assessing the outlook for economic growth in Poland, it was pointed out that in the coming quarters the above discussed factors would be conducive to lowering GDP growth.",
        "It was emphasised that the decline in economic growth was signalled, inter alia, by the deterioration in economic climate indices observed in the past few months.",
        "It was also emphasised that the growth of retail sales and industrial output in 2008 Q3 was markedly lower than in the first half of 2008.",
        "On the other hand, some members of the Council pointed out that the decline in the GDP growth in Poland would be curbed by the inflow of EU structural funds for financing investment projects, the expected relatively low level of prices of oil and other commodities as well as the zloty exchange rate depreciation observed between July and October 2008 which, if proved lasting, might mitigate the adverse impact of the weakening economic activity in the external environment of the Polish economy on the growth of Polish exports.",
        "While addressing the situation in the labour market, it was assessed that in the near term wage pressure may be expected to continue despite the decline in economic growth.",
        "At the same time, however, it was pointed out that in the longer term the wage pressure would ease due to the falling labour demand signalled, inter alia, by further decline in the annual employment growth in the corporate sector in September 2008.",
        "It was also argued that due to the economic slowdown in Western Europe, one could expect increased returns of Poles from economic migration and, consequently, a rise in the number of the economically active persons, which would contribute to further easing of the wage pressure.",
        "Moreover, it was assessed that the strong rise in corporate investment observed in the past few quarters would result in labour productivity continuing at a relatively high level, contributing to the improving of the unfavourable relation between the wage and labour productivity growth in the time to come.",
        "When analysing inflation developments in Poland, it was noted that core inflation net of food and energy prices had increased in September 2008.",
        "Some members of the Council pointed out that the rise in core inflation was one of the major factors driving the considerable increase in CPI inflation over the past year.",
        "They emphasised that the increase in the growth of the prices of services was an important factor contributing to the rise in both CPI and core inflation.",
        "They argued that high growth of those prices in the analysed period resulted, on the one hand, from growing demand pressure (which, in turn, in the opinion of those members of the Council, was the result of the high wage growth and fast credit growth observed in the past few quarters), and, on the other hand, from intensifying cost pressure driven by rising unit labour costs.",
        "Moreover, those members pointed at the signs of growing share of services in households’ consumption expenditure which suggests that the impact of the prices of services on CPI would be increasing.",
        "In the opinion of those members, accounting for those tendencies in the GUS revised CPI basket next year, provided the current prices trends continue, could be conducive to increasing inflation in 2009.",
        "Other members of the Council indicated that faced with deteriorating outlook for economic growth, the household demand for services might weaken, thus easing the pressure on further rise of those prices.",
        "They also indicated that the rise in the prices of services might be connected with the increasing demand for services resulting from the adjustment of the consumption structure in Poland to the structure prevailing in wealthier EU countries.",
        "Those members also argued that high annual growth of prices of certain services (e.g.",
        "in the group of restaurant and hotel services ) resulted, to some extent, from previous strong increases of food prices, whereas in the case of some other services the price increases were largely related to insufficient competition in the markets of those services.",
        "Some members of the Council pointed out that the rise in CPI inflation in the past year was largely driven by a rise in administered prices dependent on the decisions of central and local government entities (in particular, prices of services related to flat maintenance and energy prices), at the same time emphasising that further rise in those prices would be conducive to increasing inflation also in the future.",
        "Other members pointed out that due to the expected continued high contribution of growth in administered prices to CPI inflation, bringing CPI inflation down to the inflation target would require curbing the core inflation through considerable easing of demand pressure.",
        "While discussing the outlook for inflation, some members of the Council emphasised that increased growth of consumer prices in the past months had been largely driven by the high annual growth of food and fuel prices, and that the expected decline in the growth of those prices in the coming months, driven by falling commodity prices in the world markets, would bring inflation down.",
        "Yet, it was emphasised that at present it was difficult to assess whether the currently low level of oil prices was a lasting phenomenon or not.",
        "Some members of the Council indicated that already in September 2008 CPI inflation had decreased as a result of a strong decline in the annual growth of food and fuel prices.",
        "They also stressed that GDP growth falling below the growth of potential output in the coming quarters would contribute to curbing the inflationary pressure.",
        "Some members also argued that the rise in administered prices and increasing households’ loan service burden resulting from rising market interest rates would limit the volume of current consumption, thus contributing to lowering demand pressure and, consequently, inflationary pressure.",
        "Inflation should also be curbed by the expected easing of wage pressure and the continuing disinflationary impact of goods imported from low-cost countries.",
        "Moreover, those members assessed that due to the possible considerable weakening of economic activity in Poland, inflation in the coming quarters might be significantly lower than assumed in the October inflation projection based on the NECMOD model.",
        "In the opinion of those members of the Council, considering the current exceptionally high uncertainty about the growth outlook for the world economy, reflected in significant and frequent revisions of macroeconomic forecasts, the usefulness of forecasts based on econometric models is lower than usual.",
        "It was pointed out that due to considerable deterioration in the situation in the external environment of the Polish economy, the works on the October inflation projection based on the NECMOD model involved quantification of the related risks, in the light of which the forecast GDP growth and inflation in Poland would be lower than suggested by the data released until 26 September 2008.",
        "Some members of the Council also pointed at other inflation forecasts which had been recently revised downwards.",
        "In the opinion of other members of the Council, even considerable slowdown of GDP growth would not contribute to a rapid decline in inflation, which was reflected in the NBP’s October projection.",
        "Those members pointed at the results of other forecasts conducted at the NBP according to which the forecast inflation, despite downward revision, would be running at an increased level in the coming quarters.",
        "They also emphasised that in line with the central projection path, the forecast CPI inflation in 2009 would be running at a level above the upper limit of deviations from the NBP’s inflation target even after accounting for the quantification of risks resulting from deteriorating outlook for the global economic growth.",
        "Those members emphasised that in the light of the October projection, core inflation would remain at an elevated level in the coming quarters.",
        "It was also underlined that some measures of inflation expectations of individuals increased in September.",
        "Some members of the Council pointed out that expectations of future inflation might increase as a result of the turmoil in the financial markets and the related zloty exchange rate depreciation observed in October.",
        "At the same time it was pointed out that in September inflation expectations of bank analysts and some measures of inflation expectations of individuals decreased; in the opinion of some members of the Council, the decline in the economic activity in Poland, as anticipated by households, might contribute to the lowering of households’ expectations of future inflation.",
        "The discussion at the meeting also focused on the prospects of Poland’s accession to the euro area in the context of the calendar of preparation for the euro adoption presented in October by the Council of Ministers.",
        "It was pointed out that the likelihood of implementing this calendar was dependent upon the required majority in the Parliament supporting the amendments in the Constitution of the Republic of Poland and other legal acts necessary for euro adoption.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that developments in the financial markets would be an important factor that may affect the prospects of Poland’s adoption of the euro.",
        "While addressing the prospects of Poland’s complying with the Maastricht inflation criterion, some members of the Council argued that the decline in the economic activity in many EU countries would be considerably stronger than in Poland, causing the reference value for this criterion to decrease stronger than inflation in Poland.",
        "In the opinion of those members of the Council, this means that that complying with the Maastricht inflation criterion in 2011 may require a more restrictive monetary policy than in a situation when Poland were to meet the convergence criteria at a later date.",
        "The Council emphasised that the implementation of structural reforms, including the increasing of competition in certain sectors of the economy, would support the sustainable compliance with the convergence criteria.",
        "While discussing the exchange rate developments, attention was paid to the strong weakening of the zloty exchange rate against the US dollar and the euro observed in October.",
        "It was pointed out that the exchange rate depreciation in October was driven by the turmoil in the global financial markets and the outflow of foreign capital and that it was present in all countries of the region pursuing a floating exchange rate regime as well as many other countries.",
        "In this context, a lot of attention was paid to the current macroeconomic situation and monetary policy in some small open economies.",
        "While discussing the exchange rates, it was pointed out that amidst increased uncertainty, exchange rate developments in small open economies are subject to stronger than usual fluctuations.",
        "Some members of the Council argued that credible prospects of Poland’s accession to the euro area might limit the fluctuations of the Polish zloty against the euro, at the same time emphasising that delays in this process may lead to the depreciation of the exchange rate.",
        "The Council also discussed the impact of interest rate differential between Poland and the euro area and the United States on the zloty exchange rate developments.",
        "While discussing the decision on interest rates, the Council assessed that the considerable deterioration of the outlook for global economic growth, as well as the increased uncertainty as to the future economic activity in Poland coupled with elevated current and expected inflation, justified keeping the NBP’s interest rates unchanged at the current meeting.",
        "The Council also discussed the level of the NBP’s interest rates in the near term.",
        "Some members of the Council pointed out that in the coming quarters inflation should be expected to continue above the inflation target despite the decline in economic growth.",
        "They stressed that this, coupled with stronger weakening of the economic activity and, consequently, of the inflationary pressure in many EU countries, was likely to make it difficult for Poland to comply with the Maastricht inflation criterion.",
        "In the opinion of those members, those arguments spoke for keeping the interest rates unchanged in the coming months.",
        "Other members argued that the decline of GDP growth in the coming quarters below the potential output growth would bring inflation down to the target in the medium term, while pointing out that the weakening of the economic activity in Poland might prove stronger than currently assessed which, coupled with the limited credit availability and market interest rates remaining at an increased level due to the turmoil in the international financial markets, might contribute to bringing down inflation below the target.",
        "In the opinion of those members of the Council, those arguments might justify the need to lower the NBP’s interest rates in the coming months.",
        "The members of the Council emphasised that the assessment of the NBP’s interest rates level consistent with ensuring price stability in the medium term would depend on the data to be released in the coming months.",
        "The Council kept the interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 6.00%, the lombard rate at 7.50%, the deposit rate at 4.50% and the rediscount rate at 6.25%.",
        "During the meeting the Monetary Policy Council discussed the outlook for the future inflation developments in the context of the past, current and, primarily, anticipated economic situation.",
        "The discussion at the meeting focused on: situation in the external environment of the Polish economy, outlook for economic growth and inflation in Poland, credit market conditions, zloty exchange rate developments and prospects of the public finance sector.",
        "While addressing the situation in the external environment of the Polish economy, a further deterioration in the outlook for global economic growth, and in particular, recession already observed in the United States, the euro area and Great Britain, was noted.",
        "It was also pointed out that global economic slowdown had been accompanied by a strong decline in the prices of oil and other commodities which was conducive to curbing global inflation.",
        "It was noted that those factors urged many central banks to further considerable interest rate cuts.",
        "In some countries fears of deflation have emerged.",
        "It was emphasised that due to strong links between the financial sector and the real economy it was difficult, at the moment, to assess how strongly the global financial crisis would affect the activity in the world economy; although, this impact might prove considerable.",
        "While discussing the impact of the weakened global economy and the turmoil in the global financial markets on the outlook for economic growth in Poland, attention was paid to the downward revisions of forecasts of the domestic economic growth.",
        "It was argued that lower than expected data on industrial output and retail sales in October 2008 and weaker financial results of enterprises after the three quarters of 2008 as compared with 2007 as well as declining economic climate indices corroborated expectations of economic slowdown in Poland.",
        "Attention was also paid to the findings of enterprise surveys pointing to a decline in the expected demand and employment indices.",
        "It was emphasised that the anticipated deterioration of the situation in the labour market in Poland combined with the recession observed in Polish migration’s major destination countries might contribute to deteriorating households’ sentiment, and, as a result, to lowering consumption demand.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members, considerable deterioration in the external environment of the Polish economy and a risk of significant decline in investment and consumption demand due to deteriorating expectations about future economic situation in Poland suggested that in 2009 GDP growth in Poland might prove lower than anticipated in the NBP’s October projection.",
        "In this context, it was also pointed out that an important factor conducive to the weakening of the domestic demand would be banks’ tightening of their lending policy.",
        "Some members of the Council argued that 2009 might see a stabilisation or even a decrease in corporate and household lending.",
        "A more difficult access to loans will result mainly from the currently introduced by banks tighter loan granting criteria and conditions (more rigorous assessment of creditworthiness, higher margins, increased required collateral, higher non-interest costs of credit etc.",
        "), while the increase in costs of loans may result, to some extent, from the increase in interest rates offered by banks on deposits.",
        "Market interest rates remaining at an elevated level and limited access of banks to external financing are also conducive to curbing lending.",
        "Yet, some Council members noted that the monetary data had not, thus far, suggested any considerable slowdown in lending.",
        "While addressing the situation in the labour market it was pointed out that – despite some deceleration – the growth of wages and unit labour costs had remained at a high level.",
        "In the opinion of some members of the Council, subsequent quarters might be expected to bring a decline in employment and a rise in unemployment which might be driven by probable increase in labour supply resulting from demographic factors and lower incentives for economic migration of Poles to other EU countries.",
        "The majority of the Council members assessed that the expected decline in economic growth and the related deterioration in the labour market situation would translate into lowering wage pressure which, given the falling current inflation considerably limits the risk of the second round effects.",
        "While analyzing current inflation in Poland it was noted that for a year it had been remaining above the upper limit for deviations from the NBP inflation target.",
        "Some Council members pointed out that the currently heightened inflation resulted largely from high growth in administered prices (mainly prices of non-market services related to flat maintenance and energy prices) not directly influenced by monetary policy.",
        "At the same time it was noted that the rise in prices of some market services driven by demand pressure was also contributing to inflation remaining at an elevated level.",
        "Other members of the Council argued that the consumption growth had been continuously below the GDP growth which, in their opinion, meant that demand pressure in the Polish economy was limited.",
        "Those members pointed out that October 2008 saw a decline in four out of six core inflation indices, and core inflation net of food and energy prices remained at the level recorded in September 2008.",
        "While discussing future inflation developments, some members of the Council pointed out that due to time lags in the monetary transmission mechanism, the outlook for inflation after 2009 was currently of key importance for monetary policy.",
        "Those Council members emphasised that the expected decline in inflation would be faster than anticipated in the October projection.",
        "In their opinion, the following arguments supported such an assessment: probably stronger than previously expected economic slowdown in Poland, considerable easing of the global inflationary pressure (including further decline in commodity prices), weaker – amidst declining demand – translation of the currently observed growth in unit labour costs into prices and faster lowering of wage growth than anticipated in the projection.",
        "Those members of the Council pointed out that the growth of both food and fuel prices in 2009 might prove lower than forecast.",
        "It was also emphasized that the rise in administered prices, including prices of energy, together with an increase of excise duty on tobacco products due to the required adjustment of tax rates to the EU regulations would be delaying the process of lowering inflation.",
        "It was pointed out that the uncertainty about administered prices developments was an important factor that hinders identifying the time of inflation returning to the inflation target.",
        "While addressing the exchange rate issues, some members of the Council emphasized that the current exchange rate of the zloty was weaker than anticipated in the October inflation projection which may contribute to price increases.",
        "Moreover, those Council members pointed out that zloty depreciation limited translation of lower commodity prices in the world markets into domestic prices.",
        "Other members of the Council assessed that the impact of the zloty depreciation observed in the past few months on inflation in Poland would be limited due to the lower pass through of exchange rate changes to consumer prices amidst the expected economic slowdown.",
        "While discussing the exchange rate developments, it was pointed out that zloty depreciation in the past few months had largely been driven by the outflow of foreign capital from developing economies connected with the turmoil in the global financial markets.",
        "It was argued that the role of interest rate differential between Poland and the euro area and the United States had been temporarily limited, and the outlook for exchange rate developments depended to a major extent on the situation in the financial markets of the developed countries.",
        "Some members of the Council emphasized that exchange rate depreciation increases the volume and service cost of foreign corporate debt.",
        "Yet, it was also pointed out that weaker exchange rate of the zloty might mitigate the adverse effects of the economic slowdown in the euro area on the demand for Polish exports.",
        "The Council paid a lot of attention to the prospects of fiscal policy in 2009 in the light of the announced amendments to the draft Budget Act.",
        "It was pointed out that keeping the budget deficit at the level adopted in the original draft Budget Act would mean – under the assumption of a lower economic growth – tightening of the fiscal policy.",
        "Some members of the Council noted, however, that the final shape of the Budget Act was not yet known and the planned lowering of the expenditure did not have to mean their actual reduction, among other things, due to the possibility of reallocating some of the funds not spent in 2008 to the subsequent year.",
        "The Council emphasized that maintaining fiscal discipline in the public finance sector may be conducive to easing monetary policy.",
        "While addressing the issue of Poland’s accession to the euro area, attention was paid to increased uncertainty about the implementation of the schedule of Poland’s euro adoption, which was due to the lack of political consensus on this matter so far.",
        "At the same time it was pointed out that the monetary policy should take into account the risk of a strong economic slowdown in Poland making the compliance with the Maastricht fiscal criterion more difficult.",
        "The Council also analyzed the liquidity conditions in the banking sector and their impact on the monetary policy transmission mechanism.",
        "In this context, the Council discussed the need for possible further adjustment of monetary policy instruments to liquidity conditions in the interbank market.",
        "While discussing the decision on interest rates, some Council members assessed that further deterioration in the outlook for global economic growth, including the recession observed in Poland’s major trading partners, the signs of considerable decline in economic activity in Poland in subsequent quarters and the resulting anticipated significant lowering of the inflationary pressure in the medium term justified easing the monetary policy at the Council’s November meeting.",
        "The factor favouring the decision to ease the monetary policy was maintaining the public finance discipline amidst the expected economic slowdown declared by the government’s representatives.",
        "Those members of the Council also argued that the lowering of the NBP interest rates would prevent banks from limiting lending.",
        "Other Council members, however, pointed at the difficulty to identify the horizon of inflation returning to the inflation target and the considerable volatility of the zloty exchange rate as factors speaking for keeping the interest rates unchanged.",
        "Those members assessed that changes in the monetary policy parameters, if any, should be implemented at a later date – i.e.",
        "after the Council has got acquainted with the Budget Act for 2009 and with the subsequently released data on inflation and economic growth in Poland.",
        "The Council also discussed the scale of the NBP interest rate reduction at the current meeting.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members the considerable deterioration of the outlook for economic growth in Poland spoke for lowering interest rates by 50 basis points at the November meeting.",
        "The majority of the Council members, however, assessed that developments in the Polish economy justified a gradual easing of monetary policy.",
        "They pointed out that amidst persisting high risk aversion in the international financial markets a too strong interest rate reduction at the current meeting could lead to further exchange rate depreciation.",
        "A motion to lower the NBP interest rates by 50 basis points was put forward.",
        "The motion did not pass.",
        "A motion to lower the NBP interest rates by 25 basis points was put forward and passed.",
        "The Council decided to lower the NBP interest rates to the level: the reference rate to 5.75%, the lombard rate to 7.25%, the deposit rate to 4.25% and the rediscount rate to 6.00%.",
        "During the meeting the Monetary Policy Council discussed the outlook for inflation developments in the context of the past, current and, primarily, anticipated economic situation.",
        "The discussion at the meeting focused on: current inflation developments, including changes in regulated prices and food prices, situation in the labour market, the outlook for economic growth and the level of interest rates in Poland and abroad.",
        "The Council discussed the influence of these factors on the future inflation in Poland in view of the February inflation projection.",
        "While commenting on the current inflation, the Council analysed the reasons for annual consumer price growth accelerating – as indicated by preliminary information released by GUS (the Polish CSO) – and remaining above the NBP’s inflation target of 2.5% and also above the upper limit for deviations from the target, which is set at 3.5%.",
        "It was pointed out that the high level of CPI inflation in January was, to a large extent, the result of increased growth of regulated prices, including prices of services connected with flat or house maintenance and energy.",
        "Inflation growth was also driven by accelerating prices of other services as well as a further increase in food and fuel prices related to global factors, which are also responsible for the heightened level of inflation observed in many other countries.",
        "It was emphasised that inflation growth resulting from increased growth of regulated prices and rising food and fuel prices was in a large part beyond the control of domestic monetary policy.",
        "At the same time, it was underlined that the increase in net core inflation in January was probably larger than that of CPI inflation, which was the result of a rise in regulated prices and prices of services.",
        "The Council paid a lot of attention to the outlook for inflation over the monetary policy transmission horizon.",
        "It was pointed out that in the months to come a further acceleration in net core inflation should be expected, among other things, due to the rise in regulated prices, particularly prices of energy and natural gas.",
        "It was emphasised that a one-off increase of those prices would be pushing up the annual CPI level for the next twelve months.",
        "It was emphasised that in view of the February inflation projection based on the ECMOD model, the forecast consumer price growth would remain close to or above the upper limit for deviations from the NBP’s inflation target throughout the projection horizon, i.e.",
        "At the same time, it was underlined that the expected continuation of CPI inflation above the inflation target in the time to come would largely result from factors that are independent from monetary policy, namely an increase in regulated prices and high growth of food prices.",
        "It was also pointed out that high inflation would probably continue in other economies of the region and also in the euro area and the United States.",
        "In this context, the Council discussed the optimal monetary policy in a situation when the external conditions are conducive to heightened inflation.",
        "While discussing the probable path of food prices in 2008-2009, some Council members assessed that it was difficult to rapidly increase the global supply of food, and so the food price growth in 2008 and, consequently, CPI inflation might prove higher than accounted for in the February inflation projection.",
        "Other members of the Council believed that the food price growth should decelerate in the time to come, which was supported by futures quotations in food markets.",
        "They  argued that the rise in food prices in 2007 had resulted not only from changes in the geographical structure of global demand but also from considerable supply shocks in global markets, and so the supply of food in 2008 may be significantly higher than in 2007.",
        "Some Council members indicated that, despite a rise in CPI inflation in February, the percentage of respondents expecting faster price growth declined in the surveys of households’ inflation expectations.",
        "In the opinion of those members, this may decrease the probability of the so-called second-round effects.",
        "Those members pointed out that the current structure of inflation expectations was more favourable than in the period of inflation growth in 2004.",
        "Other members of the Council, though, emphasised that the above mentioned data pointed to a persistently high percentage of respondents who expected CPI inflation to stabilise at its current, high level.",
        "It was pointed out that even though Poland was still compliant with the Maastricht inflation criterion, there was risk that it might cease fulfilling the criterion in the coming period.",
        "At the same time, it was emphasised that except for Poland and Slovakia all the new member states of the European Union which remained outside the euro area failed to comply with this criterion.",
        "Attention was driven to the fact that Poland’s possible incompliance with the inflation criterion in the time to come would, in part, follow from the expected growth in regulated prices, which remained beyond the control of monetary policy.",
        "In this context, some Council members pointed to the need to appropriately coordinate the fiscal and monetary policies in the period preceding Poland’s accession to the euro area.",
        "While addressing the labour market situation, it was pointed out that the growth of employment and wages in the enterprise sector in January was higher than expected.",
        "It was argued that in line with the central path of the February projection of inflation and GDP based on the ECMOD model, the forecast wage growth would outpace labour productivity growth throughout the projection horizon.",
        "It was emphasised that the so-far observed and expected increase in unit labour cost was conducive to increased inflationary pressure.",
        "Some Council members emphasised that rising unit labour costs may reduce the competitiveness of the Polish economy and bring about further deepening of external imbalance.",
        "Moreover, they pointed out that the recently observed wage demands in the public finance sector may be conducive to wage demands in the private sector of the economy.",
        "Other members of the Council believed that the January data on wages and employment in the enterprise sector were difficult to interpret due to the change in the statistical sample of enterprises at the beginning of the year.",
        "Those members argued that due to the good financial standing of enterprises the high wage growth did not have to fuel inflationary pressure.",
        "Moreover, they pointed out that significant wage increases in the public finance sector in 2008 were rather unlikely, as they would require the budget deficit to be larger than the value assumed in the 2008 Budget Act.",
        "While discussing the changes in external factors affecting the Polish economy, the discussants pointed out that uncertainty persisted as to the growth outlook of the global economy, particularly of the United States and the euro area.",
        "Some Council members assessed that the slowdown in the economic growth in the United States may prove rather deep and persistent, among other things, due to problems with access to corporate credit.",
        "Those members emphasised that the slowing economic growth in the United States could be conducive to a slowdown in the world economy, including the euro area and emerging economies.",
        "Moreover, they pointed out that irrespective from the growth outlook of the US economy, some Western European countries witnessed factors which could lead to slowing economic growth in those countries in the time to come.",
        "Other members of the Council, however, argued that the lower activity in the United States could be a short-lived and small-scale phenomenon, among other things, due to the weakening of dollar exchange rate amidst rising openness of the US economy, still relatively high profitability of enterprises in this country and the considerable contribution of the service sector in GDP.",
        "While discussing the outlook for economic growth in Poland, it was pointed out that the January data on retail sales and industrial output were significantly higher than expected.",
        "Some Council members believed that this could be an indication of strong activity of the Polish economy being sustained in 2008 Q1.",
        "Those members assessed that GDP growth in emerging economies, including the Polish economy, may remain at a high level in the time to come despite the slowdown observed in developed economies.",
        "They emphasised that, in line with the central path of the February projection based on the ECMOD model, throughout the projection horizon domestic demand would be growing faster than GDP, and GDP would remain above its potential level, which should be conducive to increased inflationary pressure.",
        "They also pointed out that the rise in the domestic demand was additionally being fuelled by high growth of loans, particularly consumer loans, which had not decreased in any significant way despite NBP interest rate increases.",
        "Some Council members also pointed out that the recently observed fast growth in banking sector deposits might potentially result in increased credit growth.",
        "Other members, however, believed that at the moment it was hard to assess whether the January data indeed indicated the continuation of strong economic growth in Poland in the near future and they argued that a more comprehensive assessment of the prospects for GDP growth would only be possible based on data for subsequent months.",
        "Moreover, those members pointed out that the likely slowdown in the world economy might contribute to a slowdown in economic growth in Poland.",
        "When discussing exchange rate developments, the discussants indicated that, despite the persisting turmoil in international financial markets, zloty exchange rate was stable, and that the final days of February brought its considerable appreciation.",
        "Some Council members believed that it was currently difficult to assess the sustainability of factors which had led to this recent zloty appreciation.",
        "While discussing monetary policy, it was pointed out that further interest rate lowering was expected in the United States and the United Kingdom and that, as anticipated by financial markets, interest rates in the euro area would most probably also be reduced in 2008.",
        "Some Council members emphasised that several central banks eased monetary policy despite high inflation being observed in those countries.",
        "They also pointed out that the real interest rate in Poland was relatively high as compared to other countries of the region and that, due to the appreciation of the real zloty exchange rate, monetary conditions in Poland remained relatively tight.",
        "They argued that monetary policy tightening in Poland would increase interest rate disparity between Poland and the United States and the euro area, which might encourage the inflow of short-term capital to Poland and be conducive to zloty exchange rate appreciation.",
        "In the opinion of those members, this would weaken the competitiveness of the Polish economy and lead to further increase of external imbalance.",
        "They pointed out that in 2006-2007 in Poland – in contrast to some other countries of the region – the unfavourable trade balance was deepening with exports rising more slowly than imports.",
        "Moreover, some Council members assessed that rising interest rate disparity would be increasing the share of loans denominated in foreign currencies in total loans, which might weaken the impact of domestic monetary policy on domestic demand.",
        "Other members of the Council pointed out that the reason for monetary policy easing by certain central banks was the expected economic slowdown and financial market turmoil.",
        "Those members emphasised that in Poland, similarly as in many other countries of the region, the level of nominal interest rates necessary to keep inflation at the target level was higher than in the euro area, among other things, due to the higher economic growth, resulting from higher labour productivity growth.",
        "They pointed out that in 2007 and at the beginning of 2008 CPI inflation in Poland increased more strongly than nominal interest rates and so the real interest rate had decreased.",
        "They also argued that a considerable proportion of foreign currency denominated loans to enterprises was concentrated in a relatively small number of large enterprises and thus changes in domestic interest rates should have noticeable impact on growth in loans granted to other enterprises and on domestic demand.",
        "Moreover, they pointed out that monetary policy was being tightened in some countries.",
        "While discussing the interest rates decision, the majority of the Council members believed that it was necessary to contain the risk of sustained increased CPI inflation and curb the expected growth in net core inflation and a possible boost in inflation expectations.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members, the outlook for inflation outlined in the February projection justified a significant interest rate increase at the current meeting.",
        "In the assessment of the majority of the Council, monetary policy tightening should be measured and proceed gradually due to, among other things, the uncertainty about the potential impact of interest rate increases on zloty exchange rate and about the outlook for global economic growth.",
        "In this context, the future path of interest rates in Poland was also discussed.",
        "A motion to raise the key NBP interest rates by 50 basis points was put forward.",
        "The motion did not pass.",
        "A motion to raise the key NBP interest rates by 25 basis points was put forward and passed.",
        "The Council raised the interest rates to the following levels: the reference rate to 5.50%, the lombard rate to 7.00%, the deposit rate to 4.00% and the rediscount rate to 5.75%.",
        "During the meeting, the Monetary Policy Council discussed the outlook for inflation developments in the context of the past, current and, primarily, anticipated economic situation.",
        "The discussion at the meeting focused on: current inflation developments, including food price changes, situation in the labour market, the outlook for economic growth and the level of interest rates in Poland and abroad.",
        "The Council discussed the influence of these factors on the future inflation in Poland.",
        "While discussing current inflation, the Council analysed the causes of the annual growth of consumer prices in December increasing and remaining both above the NBP inflation target of 2.5% and the upper limit for deviations from the target set at 3.5%.",
        "It was pointed out that CPI growth in December was primarily driven by the further acceleration of food and fuel prices growth that resulted from global developments.",
        "It was emphasized that those developments were beyond the control of domestic monetary policy and that a rise in inflation driven by accelerating growth of food and fuel prices was also observed in many other countries.",
        "It was pointed out that in December net core inflation recorded a minor rise and remained relatively low.",
        "At the same time, it was emphasised that the remaining four core inflation measures also increased in December.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members, the upward trend in net core inflation recorded in the last months of 2007 reflected rising demand pressure.",
        "It was also indicated that the rise in inflation in December 2007 resulted also, among other things, from continuing high growth of prices of some services.",
        "While discussing food price developments, some members of the Council indicated that the scale of food price acceleration and the ensuing rise in CPI inflation in Poland and in many other countries significantly exceeded expectations.",
        "It was pointed out that accelerating food price growth was driven by external factors, mainly by increased demand for food on the part of rapidly developing emerging economies and a rise in production of biofuels.",
        "Some Council members assessed that increased growth of food prices might continue over a longer period due to, among other things, persistently growing demand for food and limited possibilities to augment food supply in the short term.",
        "They pointed to the fact that changes in the growth rate of food prices were previously treated as temporary shocks.",
        "In the present situation they might prove to be relatively permanent and act asymmetrically, i.e.",
        "leading to persistently relatively high inflation.",
        "In the opinion of those members, net core inflation is currently less context, some Council members pointed out that accelerating inflation resulting from increased growth of food prices and a rise in regulated prices is beyond the scope of domestic monetary policy.",
        "Other members, however, emphasized that a rise in CPI inflation might boost inflation expectations.",
        "Moreover, they indicated that certain deterioration in inflation expectations had already been observed.",
        "Attention was drawn to the fact that the deterioration in inflation expectations had come about amidst low unemployment rate and tight labour market, which might increase the likelihood of the so-called second round effects.",
        "Some members of the Council assessed that Poland is likely to cease fulfilling the Maastricht price stability criterion within a short time.",
        "Other members, however, pointed out that meeting the price stability criterion would become relevant only after the scheduled date of Poland’s joining the euro area had been fixed.",
        "While discussing the labour market situation, it was pointed out that wage growth in the corporate sector in December 2007 was lower than in the preceding months, and its decline as compared with November 2007 was stronger than it might result from the statistical effect of the dates of bonus payments in certain sectors being different than in 2006.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members, this might suggest that wage pressure in the corporate sector was likely to diminish.",
        "Moreover, those members assessed that labour productivity growth in the enterprise sector should follow an upward trend in the coming period due to investments made in the past as well as employment growth lower than in 2007, which would be conducive to reducing unit labour costs in this sector.",
        "They also argued that high wage growth did not have to lead to growing inflationary pressure given the good financial standing of enterprises.",
        "In this context, they pointed out that, as suggested by the findings of enterprise surveys, the scale of wage increases scheduled for 2008 Q1 in the enterprise sector was moderate and that the wage rises would lead to price increases only in a small part of the surveyed enterprises.",
        "They also estimated that considerable pay rises in the public finance sector were rather unlikely as this would require amendments to the Budget Act for 2008.",
        "Other members of the Council pointed out that in December the annual wage growth in the corporate sector continued to outpace labour productivity growth, which was conducive to rising consumption demand and inflationary pressure.",
        "Moreover, some members indicated that the recent period had been marked by intensifying wage demands in the public finance sector.",
        "They emphasised that a considerable rise in wages in this sector would lead to increasing domestic demand as well as demands of wage increases in other sectors of the economy, which would be conducive to growing inflationary pressure.",
        "In the opinion of some members of the Council, tight labour market reflected in the rapid decline in unemployment rate and a swift labour demand growth would not diminish significantly in the time to come due to economic emigration of Poles and persisting differences in the level of wages between Poland and Western European countries.",
        "Other members argued that the expected slowdown in the economic growth in Western European countries might result in certain emigrants returning to Poland, which would be conducive to diminishing wage pressure.",
        "While addressing the changes in external factors affecting the Polish economy, the discussants pointed at further deterioration in the outlook for economic growth in the United States.",
        "It was indicated that this increased the likelihood of a slowdown in the world economy, in particular in Great Britain and, consequently, the euro area.",
        "Attention was drawn to the simultaneous increase in the uncertainty about the outlook for growth in the world economy.",
        "It was argued that considerable drops in equity prices in the global financial markets might – similarly to 2001 – become one of the factors contributing to a deterioration in investor expectations and weakening economic growth in Europe.",
        "While discussing the outlook for economic growth in Poland, it was pointed out that December data on industrial output and retail sales were significantly below expectations.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members, those data might point at a gradual decline in the economic growth in Poland, which would ease the demand pressure and, consequently, inflationary pressure.",
        "Those members pointed out that the likely slowdown in the world economy might lead to a slowdown in economic growth in Poland.",
        "They indicated that the turmoil in the global financial markets in January 2008 also affected the Warsaw Stock Exchange and emphasised that the resulting possible deterioration in investor expectations might contribute to weakening the economic growth in Poland.",
        "Other members of the Council thought it was currently difficult to assess whether the December data suggested a decline in economic activity in Poland and that only the data referring to the subsequent months would allow an assessment whether there was a decline in GDP growth.",
        "Those members pointed out that in 2007 Q3 domestic demand continued to grow faster than GDP suggesting an increase in inflationary pressure.",
        "In the opinion of those members, the increase in domestic demand was driven by high growth in lending.",
        "Moreover, they assessed that high growth in corporate lending indicated that investment growth might be sustained at a high level, which would be conducive to maintaining fast economic growth.",
        "Some discussants pointed out that the fast growth in bank deposits might possibly result in increased lending growth and stronger demand pressure.",
        "Moreover, some members of the Council indicated that the slowdown in economic growth in the United States would affect the economic activity in the euro area, and consequently in Poland, after a certain time lag.",
        "Those members assessed that the economic slowdown in emerging economies will have a smaller scale than in the United States and the euro area and that the weakening economic growth in Poland would not significantly reduce the labour market tensions.",
        "While discussing exchange rate developments, some Council members pointed out that in 2007 the zloty exchange rate both against the US dollar and against the euro had appreciated, and that in January 2008 the nominal effective exchange rate had been stronger than accounted for in the October projection, which was conducive to diminishing inflationary pressure.",
        "It was emphasised that despite the turmoil in the international financial markets observed in January the zloty exchange rate remained stable.",
        "On the other hand, some discussants indicated that zloty appreciation might stem from the appreciation of the real equilibrium exchange rate related to the convergence process.",
        "Moreover, it was pointed out that it was currently difficult to assess the sustainability of factors which had led to zloty appreciation in the previous period.",
        "It was also argued that slump in the global financial markets might increase the likelihood of capital outflow from emerging markets which might be conducive to zloty exchange rate depreciation.",
        "While addressing monetary policy, it was pointed out that in January 2008 interest rates were lowered considerably in the United States and further lowering of interest rates was expected, and that, as anticipated by financial markets, interest rates in the euro area would probably also be reduced.",
        "Some Council members indicated that certain central banks eased monetary policy despite high inflation being observed in those countries.",
        "Some members of the Council emphasised that the real interest rate in Poland was high as compared with other countries of the region, and that interest rate increases by the NBP in 2007 were accompanied by zloty appreciation.",
        "They pointed out that in January 2008 zloty exchange rate continued to be stronger than accounted for in the October inflation projection.",
        "In the opinion of those members, as compared with other countries of the region, monetary conditions in Poland remained tight .",
        "They argued that monetary policy tightening increased interest rate disparity between Poland and the United States and the euro area, which might encourage the inflow of shortterm capital to Poland and be conducive to zloty exchange rate appreciation.",
        "In the opinion of those members, this would weaken the competitiveness of the Polish economy and lead to further increase of external imbalance.",
        "Moreover, they pointed out that increasing interest rate disparity would lead to a growing share of loans denominated in foreign currency in total loans, which might weaken the impact of domestic monetary policy on domestic demand.",
        "Other Council members argued that as compared with other countries of the region, the share of foreign currency denominated loans in total loans in Poland remained relatively low.",
        "On the other hand, the discussants pointed out that in 2007 the rise in CPI inflation in Poland was stronger than the growth of nominal interest rates, and thus the real interest rate decreased.",
        "Some of them also emphasised that in certain countries real interest rates were currently higher than in Poland.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that the reason for monetary policy easing by certain central banks was the expected economic slowdown and the financial market turmoil of January 2008.",
        "While discussing the interest rates decision, the majority of the Council members believed that it was necessary to contain the risk of sustained increased CPI inflation and curb the expected growth in net core inflation and a possible boost in inflation expectations.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members, the inflation outlook justified a significant increase in interest rates at the January meeting.",
        "In the opinion of the majority of the Council, monetary policy tightening should be measured and proceed gradually due to, among other things, the increased uncertainty about the outlook for economic growth in Poland and abroad as well as uncertainty about the potential impact of interest rate increases on zloty exchange rate.",
        "In this context, the future path of interest rates in Poland was also discussed.",
        "A motion to raise the key NBP interest rates by 50 basis points was put forward.",
        "The motion did not pass.",
        "A motion to raise the key NBP interest rates by 25 basis points was put forward and passed.",
        "The Council raised the interest rates to the following levels: the reference rate to 5.25%, the lombard rate to 6.75%, the deposit rate to 3.75% and the rediscount rate to 5.50%.",
        "During the meeting the Monetary Policy Council discussed the outlook for the future inflation developments in the context of the past, current and, primarily, anticipated economic situation.",
        "The discussion at the meeting focused on: current inflation developments, assessment of the risk of second round effects, situation in the labour market, the outlook for economic growth in Poland and abroad and exchange rate developments.",
        "The Council discussed the influence of these factors on the future inflation in Poland.",
        "While commenting on the current inflation, it was pointed out that in April CPI inflation had decelerated slightly (to 4.0% y/y), which had been driven by a decline in the annual growth of fuel and food prices.",
        "On the other hand, further acceleration in the growth of prices of certain services was a factor increasing inflation.",
        "It was emphasized that inflation remaining above the upper limit for deviations from the NBP’s inflation target set at 3.5% was mainly the result of the previously observed rise in food prices and increases in administered prices.",
        "It was also indicated that increased inflation negatively affects financial condition of households, mainly those less affluent, in particular, when it is related to high growth in food prices.",
        "Yet, it was emphasised that due to favourable forecasts of harvest further decline in the growth of food prices may be expected.",
        "Members of the Council paid a lot of attention to the reasons behind inflation remaining at the increased level.",
        "They argued that inflation developments in many countries, including Poland, were largely affected by increases in prices of food and oil in the global markets leading to changes in relative prices – i.e.",
        "factors beyond the impact of domestic monetary policy.",
        "It was pointed out that in comparison with other countries of the Central and Eastern Europe, Poland recorded the lowest CPI inflation and as regards HICP index only Slovakia had lower inflation than Poland.",
        "Some members of the Council stressed that additional factors, that are also largely beyond the impact of monetary policy, conducive to growth in prices in the new EU member states include: price and wage convergence and harmonisation of indirect taxes.",
        "While discussing the outlook for inflation, some members of the Council pointed out that considering the recently observed rise in oil prices in the world markets and the results of the NBP’s short-term forecasts, inflation in the quarters to come may be expected to remain above the upper limit for deviations from the target.",
        "In the medium term, higher inflation would be driven by high growth in wages and unit labour costs.",
        "At the same time, some members of the Council pointed out that further growth in gas and energy prices related to growing prices of energy resources and liberalisation of energy prices in Poland might be a factor driving inflation in 2009.",
        "In the longer term, weakening growth of energy prices should be driven by liberalisation of the energy market.",
        "On the other hand, inflation should be curbed by: lower GDP growth abroad, observed exchange rate appreciation and previous increases of interest rate.",
        "Some members of the Council pointed out that a situation of inflation running markedly above the NBP’s inflation target for a longer time increases the risk of second-round effects.",
        "This is so because increased inflation may lead to more permanent heightened inflation expectations, which is suggested by a large share of respondents in household surveys expecting inflation to remain at the present level.",
        "Yet, other members of the Council pointed that inflation expectations of households observed in May had lowered.",
        "Moreover, some members of the Council assessed that the risk of second round effects is limited due to factors discouraging enterprises from further wage increases.",
        "In this context, members of the Council pointed at the expected slowdown in the economic growth reflected in a decline of business sentiment indicators in the corporate sector published in May, zloty appreciation and a deceleration in profit ratios of enterprises in 2008 Q1.",
        "While addressing the situation in the labour market, some members of the Council pointed out that strong growth in wages continued to be the major risk factor for price stability.",
        "According to those members of the Council, the April data on wages and employment in the corporate sector and current estimates of unit labour costs in the economy for 2008 Q1 corroborated persistently high wage pressure.",
        "At the same time, some members of the Council pointed at a growing wage pressure in the public finance sector and related uncertainty about the 2009 budget.",
        "Attention was paid to the fact that increased inflation constituted one of the factors behind currently growing wage pressure in this sector.",
        "While assessing the outlook for economic growth in Poland, some members of the Council pointed out that data concerning economic activity are currently characterized with large volatility related, inter alia, to a different calendar of holidays than in 2007 and restrictions imposed on retail trading on holidays.",
        "They argue that in such a situation more attention should be paid to business sentiment indicators which - although point at favourable economic situation - had declined in May.",
        "Those members also pointed out that in 2008 Q1 there was a decrease in the production capacity utilization.",
        "According to those members of the Council, economic growth in Poland in the quarters to come should decline to the level of potential growth.",
        "Other members of the Council emphasized that GDP growth in Poland continued to outpace the potential and signals of a slowdown are too weak to expect that inflation will return to the target without further adjustment of monetary policy.",
        "Some members of the Council argued that the decline in profit ratios of enterprises might have a negative impact on investment growth.",
        "According to those members of the Council, also lower demand for Polish exports would be a factor curbing economic growth.",
        "Lower external demand related to economic slowdown abroad is corroborated by the results of the economic condition surveys for 2008 Q1 where indicator of export forecast declined again.",
        "The meeting also focused on changes in the external conditions of the Polish economy.",
        "Some members of the Council pointed out that the data on GDP growth in 2008 Q1 for the United States and the euro area had proved better that expected.",
        "Other members of the Council argued that majority of economic indicators point at a serious slowdown in the American economy.",
        "Whereas referring to the situation in the euro area some members of the Council indicated considerable differences in economic growth between particular countries.",
        "They also emphasized that weak domestic demand together with a risk of a decline in external demand connected both with appreciation of the euro against the American dollar and the British pound and with the slowdown in the American and British economies, continued to be risk factors for economic growth in the euro area.",
        "Those members argued that concerns related to economic slowdown were translated into higher risk premia included in interest rates on corporate loans offered by banks in the euro area.",
        "It was also pointed out that Poland is among the EU countries whose business cycles are most closely correlated with the business cycle in the euro area which means that the slowdown in the euro area would probably have a negative impact on economic growth in Poland.",
        "Moreover, some members of the Council pointed out that uncertainty persisting in the world economy might result in lower inflow of direct investment to Poland which would also bring a decline in economic growth.",
        "While addressing the dilemmas faced by central banks, some members of the Council pointed at a risk of stagflation, i.e.",
        "a situation where weakening economic growth would be accompanied by high inflation.",
        "In this context, the Council discussed appropriate response of monetary authorities to inflation remaining at an increased level, in particular, when it results, to a great extent, from factors beyond the impact of a domestic monetary policy.",
        "While discussing exchange rate developments some members of the Council pointed out that zloty strengthening was an important factor tightening monetary conditions in the recent period.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that further rise in interest rate differential might result in increased inflow of short-term capital to Poland, driving further appreciation of the zloty and deterioration of financial results of enterprises which would have a negative impact on investment activity and economic growth.",
        "Other members of the Council argued that expectations concerning Fed and ECB interest rates had been changed, which is of significant importance for the outlook of interest rate differential in the period to come.",
        "With regard to the United States, interest rates are expected to be raised at the end of the year, whereas with regard to the euro area it had become common to expect interest rates to be kept at the current level.",
        "Moreover, these members of the Council pointed out that it was difficult at that time to assess the sustainability of the factors which had recently contributed to zloty appreciation.",
        "While analysing the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the economy, some members of the Council pointed at a risk of growing external imbalance in case of excessive zloty appreciation.",
        "Yet, other members of the Council argued that it was difficult to assess to what extent widened current account deficit was connected with exchange rate appreciation and to what extent it might result from economic growth exceeding the potential GDP growth.",
        "At the meeting, members of the Council discussed the usefulness of the so-called Taylor rule in monetary policy.",
        "According to some members of the Council this rule should be used in conducting monetary policy.",
        "However, other members of the Council indicated that this rule should rather be used in ex post assessments.",
        "In this context they pointed at problems of correct specification of this rule and the uncertainty of the estimates of natural interest rate and potential output growth for Poland.",
        "While referring to the interest rate decision, potential further tightening of monetary policy was discussed.",
        "In the opinion of some members of the Council, the risk of permanently heightened inflation expectations, high growth in wages and employment and GDP growth remaining above the potential output as well as the absence of clear signs of economic slowdown pointed at the risk of inflation remaining above the inflation target in the medium term.",
        "According to those members of the Council, those factors justified an interest rate increase at the May meeting.",
        "Moreover, those members pointed out that withholding the decision to raise interest rates increased the risk of inflation remaining above the inflation target for a longer period which would subsequently require more pronounced curbing of economic growth necessary to bring inflation down to the target.",
        "Yet, some members of the Council judged that the previous interest rate increases along with considerable appreciation of the zloty exchange rate and expected economic slowdown might prove sufficient to bring inflation down to the target in the medium term.",
        "The majority of the Council members argued, that a more comprehensive assessment of the risk of inflation remaining at an increased level will be possible after getting acquainted with the June inflation projection of the NBP.",
        "In their opinion, these arguments justified no interest rate change at the present meeting of the Council.",
        "A motion to raise the key NBP interest rates by 25 basis points was put forward at the meeting.",
        "The motion did not pass.",
        "The Council kept the interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 5.75%, the lombard rate at 7.25%, the deposit rate at 4.25%, at the rediscount rate at 6.00%.",
        "During the meeting the Monetary Policy Council discussed the outlook for future inflation developments in the context of the past, current and, primarily, anticipated economic situation.",
        "The discussion at the meeting focused on exchange rate developments and their impact on economic growth, external balance and inflation, the outlook for economic growth in Poland and abroad and the situation in the labour market.",
        "The Council discussed the influence of these factors on future inflation in Poland.",
        "While analysing the impact of exchange rate developments on the outlook for inflation and economic growth in Poland, attention was paid to the depreciation of the exchange rate of the zloty and other currencies of the region, both against the US dollar and the euro, which was observed in August 2008.",
        "It was indicated that at present it was difficult to assess whether the observed zloty depreciation would be of permanent nature.",
        "Yet, some members of the Council pointed to the risk of zloty depreciation in the context of the anticipated economic slowdown in Poland.",
        "Moreover, they indicated that changes in the exchange rate of the euro against the US dollar might be important for future zloty exchange rate developments.",
        "Those members emphasised that in the case of further depreciation of the zloty, the exchange rate would cease to be the factor curbing inflation in Poland.",
        "At the same time it was pointed out that the slowdown in the global economy, including in the EU economies, might result in lower demand for Polish exports which would contribute to the depreciation of the equilibrium exchange rate.",
        "Other members of the Council also pointed out that despite the recently observed depreciation, the exchange rate of the zloty continued to be considerably stronger than in the previous quarters.",
        "They argued that although exchange rate appreciation constituted a factor curbing imported inflation, further interest rate hikes might lead to a renewed appreciation of the zloty exchange rate, which could negatively affect the competitiveness of Polish manufacturers and, as a result, economic activity in Poland.",
        "While analysing the developments of the zloty exchange rate, the Council discussed the impact of the appreciation on the external balance of the Polish economy.",
        "It was pointed out that according to preliminary data in the first half of 2008 the foreign trade deficit had deepened.",
        "Attention was also paid to the fact that preliminary data suggested changes in the structure of financing of the current account deficit of the balance of payments, reflected in a decline of foreign direct investment and a growth in portfolio investment in 2008 Q2.",
        "Some members of the Council argued that the rise in the foreign trade deficit had probably been driven by a strong appreciation of the zloty exchange rate leading to deteriorating competitiveness of Polish producers both on the domestic market as well as on foreign markets.",
        "Other members of the Council pointed out, however, that import growth outstripping export growth could have been connected with high growth in domestic demand, hence, considering the expected economic slowdown in Poland, import growth should be expected to decline.",
        "Besides, those members reasoned that in the longer term wage growth outpacing labour productivity growth might be a more important factor leading to deteriorating competitiveness of Polish exports.",
        "While addressing changes in the external environment of the Polish economy, attention was paid to the persisting, despite relatively high GDP growth in 2008 Q2, unfavourable outlook for economic  Warszawa ulica Świętokrzyska telefon (22)  55  (22)  51 growth in the United States, as well as deeper than expected deterioration in economic conditions in certain EU economies.",
        "Particular attention was paid to strong economic slowdown, deteriorating economic conditions indicators and further worsening of consumer sentiment in economies which constitute the main markets for Polish exports – Germany, France, Italy and Great Britain.",
        "The worsening outlook for exports in the euro area was also pointed to, particularly for German exports, which, due to the strong trade links between Polish and German exporters, might translate into a decline in Polish exports.",
        "During the discussion, attention was paid to a considerable drop in fuel prices in the global market observed since early July 2008, noting, at the same time, that at present it was difficult to assess whether this phenomenon was of permanent nature.",
        "Some members of the Council argued that due to the anticipated further deterioration in business conditions in the developed countries, the risk of further strong growth of fuel prices in the global market had declined.",
        "Moreover, those members indicated that slower growth in global demand might also translate into curbing the rising prices of other commodities which would be conducive to reducing global inflation.",
        "While discussing the outlook for economic growth in Poland, it was pointed to the signs of economic slowdown i.e.",
        "lower that expected growth in industrial output and further decline in manufacturing orders in July 2008, deteriorating financial results of enterprises and growing share of semi-finished goods and work-in-progress, goods and finished products in the structure of inventories in the first half of 2008 as well as a deterioration of the majority of economic conditions indicators.",
        "Some members of the Council pointed out that a further decline in GDP growth might by triggered by limited investment, which could be driven by deteriorating profit ratios of enterprises.",
        "Moreover, they argued that further weakening in business conditions in the EU might – through falling demand for Polish exports – lead to a deeper-than-currently-anticipated decline in economic growth in Poland.",
        "Other members of the Council pointed out, however, that GDP growth in 2008 Q2 had probably been higher than anticipated in the June projection, which suggested that the scale of subsequent decline in economic growth might be smaller that projected.",
        "They also indicated that drawing conclusions about changes in economic activity in Poland based on the monthly data on industrial output was subject to uncertainty, especially taking into account the growing share of services in the structure of the Polish economy.",
        "While analysing the situation in the labour market it was pointed to persistently high growth in wages and unit labour costs running well above the level anticipated in the June projection.",
        "Some members of the Council argued that the relation between wage growth and labour productivity growth might deteriorate in the near future due to the expected economic slowdown and the resulting decline in labour productivity growth.",
        "On the other hand, other members of the Council reasoned that the economic slowdown would contribute to lower labour demand, and consequently, with a certain time lag, would curb wage pressure, whereas the persistently relatively high investment growth would be conducive to growth in labour productivity.",
        "They also paid attention to the diminishing importance of wage pressure as a growth barrier indicated by enterprises in the NBP’s business condition surveys and gradually declining employment growth amidst continued growth in economic activity.",
        "Moreover, those members argued that tensions in the labour market would be eased as a result of declining migration outflows, due to, among other things, weakening in business conditions in Great Britain and other EU countries.",
        "It was also pointed out that high wage growth was partly related to the process of convergence of the Polish economy with richer countries of the EU.",
        "When assessing the impact of the persistently high wage growth on inflationary processes, some members of the Council argued that amidst continuing fast growth in demand, entrepreneurs might tend to pass on the increase in labour costs to prices.",
        "Moreover, attention was paid to the fact that growing consumer demand driven by rising income of households was conducive to growing inflationary pressure as indicated by the rise in core inflation, including growth in the prices of services, which had been observed for several quarters.",
        "Those members also pointed out that the anticipated rise in CPI in August 2008 created a risk of a rise in inflation expectations.",
        "On the other hand, some members of the Council indicated that the previous month saw inflationary expectations stabilising and that an economic slowdown in Poland would limit the risk of second-round effects.",
        "They also pointed out that the impact of a rapid wage growth on inflation might be mitigated by the decline in the share of labour costs in the total costs of enterprises, observed in the previous years.",
        "Some members of the Council pointed out that factors contributing to persisting demand pressure might include, apart from rapid wage growth, still high although declining credit growth, including high growth in consumer loans.",
        "Other members of the Council argued, however, that as a result of the declining value of financial assets of households and the growth in new loans, asset encumbrance had been growing which should limit households’ future borrowing capacity.",
        "They also emphasised that an economic slowdown might have the same effect.",
        "At the same time it was pointed out that the possible growth in interest-rate differentials might have a limited impact on the growth in credit aggregates due to the possibility of zloty-denominated loans being substituted by foreign-currency-denominated loans.",
        "On the other hand, it was argued that an interest rate rise should be conducive to a decline in credit growth, among other things, through influencing the expectations of future income of households.",
        "The meeting also addressed current inflation developments.",
        "It was pointed out that in July core inflation net of food and energy prices continued to run at the level recorded in June 2008, and the acceleration of CPI inflation as compared with the previous month had been driven by the increasing growth of food, energy and fuel prices.",
        "The attention was also paid to the fact that inflation in Poland, similarly as in Slovakia, continued to be the lowest in the region.",
        "It was also emphasised that the 12-month moving average HICP inflation taken into account while assessing the compliance with the Maastricht price stability criterion, despite its increase, still had not exceeded the reference value.",
        "While discussing the decision on interest rates, some members of the Council pointed out that the scale of economic slowdown might not be sufficient to bring inflation down to the target over the monetary policy horizon.",
        "Moreover, curbed appreciation of the zloty coupled with the risk of exchange rate depreciation connected with the expected slowdown in the Polish economy, falling real interest rates – despite the already implemented interest rate increases – and the risk of inflation expectations continuing at a heightened level justified, in their opinion, raising interest rates at the present meeting.",
        "In the judgement of those members, delaying subsequent interest rate increases might boost the costs of bringing inflation down to the target.",
        "In the opinion of other members of the Council, considerable economic slowdown abroad, signs of economic slowdown in Poland, the already implemented interest rate increases and the expected decline in wage pressure would constitute factors bringing inflation down to the target in the medium term.",
        "Those members also pointed out that interest rate rise could be conducive to the appreciation of the zloty exchange rate which would pose a risk of a deeper economic slowdown in Poland and further rising of external imbalance.",
        "Moreover, they argued that a more comprehensive assessment of the risk of inflation continuing at a heightened level in the medium term would be possible after analysing the data to be released in the coming months.",
        "A motion to raise the key NBP interest rates by 25 basis points was put forward at the meeting.",
        "The motion did not pass.",
        "The Council kept the interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 6.00%, the lombard rate at 7.50%, the deposit rate at 4.50% and the rediscount rate at 6.25%.",
        "During the meeting the Monetary Policy Council discussed the outlook for the future inflation developments in the context of the past, current and, above all, anticipated economic situation.",
        "The discussion at the meeting focused on: the outlook for inflation and economic growth in Poland and in the world economy, situation in the labour market in Poland and the prospects of Poland’s entry to the euro area.",
        "When analysing the economic growth developments in Poland, it was pointed out that GDP growth in 2008 Q2 had been much higher and in 2008 Q3 would probably be also higher than expected in the June projection.",
        "Some Council members, however, pointed to the rise in contribution of gross fixed capital formation and a drop in contribution of total consumption to GDP growth in 2008 Q2, which might indicate easing the upward pressure on consumer prices.",
        "These members argued as well that the drop in industrial output, bigger than expected reduction of growth in construction and assembly output and marked deterioration of economic climate indices in the corporate sector in August 2008 signalled significant weakening of economic activity in Poland in the coming quarters.",
        "They also pointed out that a lowering of the demand for Polish exports, due to the significant deterioration of economic growth in countries which are Poland’s main trading partners, would be conducive to the decline in GDP growth.",
        "The similar impact would be exerted by the appreciation of the zloty observed in the first half of the year, which reduces the competitiveness of Polish producers in foreign markets and in the domestic market, and the weakening of consumption demand related to the probable deterioration of situation in the labour market.",
        "While discussing the situation in the external environment of the Polish economy, further marked deterioration of outlook for economic growth in the United States and the euro area was noted.",
        "The fall in industrial output in these economies as well as further deterioration of economic climate indices were underscored.",
        "Some members of the Council pointed out that the crisis in the housing market and financial markets would contribute to a significant drop in consumer demand in the US economy.",
        "These members also emphasized that the support granted to financial institutions by the government of the United States would reduce the possibility of further demand stimulation by means of fiscal policy.",
        "Demand might be further reduced by regulations tightening criteria for granting loans, which were likely to be introduced in the United States.",
        "It was pointed out that the intensification of turmoil in financial markets in the United States would probably translate to the situation in the banking sector of some of the EU economies and would be an additional factor dampening economic activity in these countries.",
        "With respect to the situation in the labour market in Poland, attention was drawn to the continuous decline in employment growth since the beginning of the year and the decline in wage growth in the corporate sector in August 2008.",
        "Some members of the Council argued that it might indicate that declining economic activity in Poland would be accompanied by relatively fast easing of wage pressure.",
        "These members also pointed out that the growth in labour supply in Poland related to possible increased returns of Poles from EU countries in which the current and anticipated economic situation had significantly deteriorated might also be conducive to the decline in wage growth.",
        "Other members of the Council, however, emphasized that wage growth remained strong  and might remain at a heightened level due to the lag between the weakening of economic activity and deterioration of the situation in the labour market.",
        "In their assessment, that effect, coupled with decreasing GDP growth, might lead in the nearest future to further drop in labour productivity and consequently to the increase in unit labour costs.",
        "Other members of the Council also pointed out that the decline in wage growth might be reduced by the process of convergence of the Polish economy to more developed EU economies where the share of compensations in GDP is much higher than in Poland.",
        "Furthermore, some members emphasized that a fast rise in unit labour costs might in the longer horizon significantly reduce the competitiveness of Polish enterprises, including exporters.",
        "The development of monetary aggregates in Poland was also discussed during the meeting.",
        "Some members of the Council drew attention to a still very strong growth in consumer credits, emphasizing that it would probably support continuously high demand pressure.",
        "At the same time, these members pointed out that the high growth of broad money supply observed for the last several years might indicate the persistence of inflationary pressure in the economy.",
        "Other members of the Council, however, noted that credit growth might be reduced by possible tightening of criteria for granting loans, as well as by the decrease in creditworthiness of households related to their deteriorating financial situation as a result of a significant drop in value of their assets.",
        "When analysing inflation developments in Poland, it was noted that the harmonized index of consumer prices (HICP) in Poland in August 2008 was still the lowest among the countries of the region and also lower than in the majority of the countries of the euro area.",
        "Attention was also drawn to the lower than expected CPI inflation in August 2008 and to the decline in food and oil prices in global markets, which should be conducive to lowering inflation over the following few months.",
        "Some members of the Council pointed, however, to a significant rise in core inflation net of food and energy prices in August 2008.",
        "At the same time, it was emphasised that this measure of core inflation had been lower till July 2008 due to the promotional Internet price reduction last year, and its level observed since August 2008 better reflects price processes in the economy.",
        "Some members of the Council drew attention to the risk of core inflation remaining in the coming quarters above the NBP inflation target and the CPI inflation above the upper limit for deviations from the target due to possible increases of administered prices.",
        "Other members of the Council, however, pointed out that in the light of the probable resignation from the earlier announced deregulation of energy prices for households since the beginning of 2009, the energy price growth might be lower than earlier expected, and therefore the risk of inflation remaining at a heightened level might decline.",
        "An important factor taken into account during the discussion was the result of the meeting between the Prime Minister and representatives of the government with the Monetary Policy Council held on 16 September 2008 concerning the perspectives of Poland's accession to the euro area.",
        "At the Council’s meeting some members of the Council pointed out that complying with the Maastricht inflation criterion in 2011 may require a more restrictive monetary policy than in a situation when Poland were to meet the convergence criteria in a later period.",
        "Some of the members observed that the need to meet this criterion in 2011 and by implication to stabilise inflation at an adequate level in 2010-2011 justified the tightening of monetary policy at the current meeting.",
        "According to other members of the Council the slowdown in the Polish economy would contribute to bringing inflation down to a level enabling meeting the Maastricht inflation criterion.",
        "Moreover, some members of the Council noted that due to the uncertainty with respect to obtaining the support of the required parliamentary majority for changes in the constitution necessary from the point of view of introducing euro in Poland, there was no need to consider the possible adjustment of the monetary policy to the necessity of meeting the inflation criterion at the current meeting.",
        "The impact of the prospects of Poland’s entry to the euro area on the zloty exchange rate was also discussed during the meeting.",
        "Some members of the Council pointed out that Poland's preparations towards joining the euro area might be accompanied by the appreciation of the nominal zloty exchange rate, which would be conducive to reducing inflation.",
        "Other members of the Council observed, however, that there was a risk of the zloty depreciation if the political consultations mentioned in the joint press release of the Prime Minister and the Monetary Policy Council, did not succeed, particularly in the context of increased global risk aversion due to the turmoil in financial markets.",
        "While discussing the decision on interest rates, some members of the Council pointed out that the scale of economic slowdown might be insufficient to reduce inflation to the target over the monetary policy horizon.",
        "Moreover, according to these members of the Council, the risk of inflation remaining above the upper limit for deviations from the target in the longer run, the risk of the exchange rate depreciation related to the turmoil in global financial markets and the possibility of revising the assessments concerning the perspective of Poland's entry to the euro area, the risk of inflation expectations remaining at an elevated level and the decreasing - despite the already implemented interest rate increases - real interest rates justified rising interest rates at the current meeting.",
        "In the assessment of these members of the Council, such decision was warranted also by perspectives of Poland's entry to the euro area outlined after the meeting with the Prime Minister and by the ensuing necessity of meeting the Maastricht inflation criterion.",
        "Furthermore, these members also pointed out that delaying interest rate increases might raise the costs of bringing inflation down to the target.",
        "According to other members of the Council, significant weakening of the economic activity in the external environment of the Polish economy, signs of economic slowdown in Poland, the already implemented interest rate increases, as well as the fall in the prices of agricultural and energy commodities in global markets would support the return of inflation to the target in medium term.",
        "These members also indicated that interest rate increases might be conducive to excessive curbing of domestic demand and – by supporting the renewed appreciation of the zloty exchange rate – to decreasing the price competitiveness of exports, and as a consequence might create the risk of a significant weakening of economic activity in Poland.",
        "According to these members of the Council, the uncertainty related to turmoil in global financial markets and the lack of political consensus regarding the date of adopting the euro warranted abstaining from the possible adjustment of the monetary policy to the necessity of meeting the inflation criterion.",
        "Moreover, they argued that a more comprehensive assessment of the risk of inflation remaining in the medium term at an elevated level would be possible after analysing the October projection of inflation and GDP and the data released in the coming months.",
        "A motion to raise the NBP interest rates by 25 basis points was put forward at the meeting.",
        "The motion did not pass.",
        "The Council kept the interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 6.00%, the lombard rate at 7.50%, the deposit rate at 4.50% and the rediscount rate at 6.25%.",
        "During the meeting the Monetary Policy Council discussed the outlook for the future inflation developments in the context of the past, current and, primarily, anticipated economic situation.",
        "The discussion at the meeting focused on: labour market situation, the outlook for economic growth and the exchange rate developments.",
        "The Council discussed the influence of these factors on the future inflation in Poland in view of the June inflation projection.",
        "The Council paid a lot of attention to the outlook for CPI inflation in Poland in the coming quarters.",
        "Some members of the Council pointed out that according to the June inflation projection based on the NECMOD model, the forecast inflation would be gradually decreasing starting from 2009 Q1 and, in line with the central projection path, it would be approaching the inflation target faster than expected in the February projection.",
        "Those members emphasised that the increased inflation resulting from food and fuel price growth in the world markets is observed in many other countries, including the euro area.",
        "They assessed that – similarly to many other countries – the period of heightened inflation may prove longer than expected so far.",
        "At the same time, they pointed out that in May, despite a rise in regulated prices, inflation in Poland was still at the lowest level among the Central and Eastern European countries, which was, among others, due to the monetary policy conducted in Poland in the earlier period.",
        "The Council members indicated that CPI inflation in May rose to 4.4% and that in the months to come it may be even higher, among others, due to the statistical base effect.",
        "They emphasised that at the beginning of 2009 a further increase in electricity prices triggered by their deregulation may be conducive to a rise in CPI inflation.",
        "Some Council members indicated that, in line with the June projection, core inflation net of food and energy prices would be gradually growing and in 20092010 it would run above 2.5%, which – in the opinion of those members – signals the build-up of demand pressure in the economy.",
        "While discussing the outlook for economic growth in Poland, it was pointed out that in May the growth of industrial output was markedly lower than expected, which had been previously signalled by business sentiment indicators.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members, this may indicate a slowdown in the Polish economy in the nearest future.",
        "Those members argued that lower activity in the world economy, particularly in the euro area, together with the recently observed appreciation of zloty exchange rate would both contribute to the slowdown of the economic growth in Poland.",
        "They emphasised that in view of the June projection based on the NECMOD model, the forecast GDP growth in the second half of 2008 would be lower than the growth of potential GDP, which would be conducive to easing the inflationary pressure.",
        "Moreover, they argued that the composition of GDP in 2008 Q1 was favourable in terms of inflation outlook, as private consumption growth was lower and investment growth higher than GDP growth.",
        "Other members of the Council, in turn, pointed out that GDP growth in 2008 Q1 was higher than expected and most probably higher than potential GDP growth.",
        "While assessing the outlook for economic growth, those members highlighted that the data on industrial output in May were difficult to interpret due to the different calendar of public holidays than in 2007 and that the retail sales growth in May was relatively high.",
        "Those members believed that the slowdown in economic activity in Poland would probably not be significant.",
        "They argued that in the time to come the consumption growth would not mark a significant decrease, among others, due to the continuously high growth of wages and loans to households and the rising share of consumer loans in total loans granted to households.",
        "While addressing labour market developments, the continuation of a strong wage growth and unfavourable relation between wage and labour productivity growth were pointed out.",
        "It was emphasised that in May unit labour costs in industry increased significantly due to the drop in the industrial output growth and a high wage growth.",
        "It was underlined that in line with June projection based on the NECMOD model, the forecast wage growth in the economy throughout the projection horizon would be faster than labour productivity growth and thus unit labour costs would continue to rise.",
        "Some Council members pointed out that 2008 Q1 brought an increase in the share of wage costs in total costs of enterprises, which was conducive to raising the inflationary pressure.",
        "Those members assessed that the heightened pressure on wage growth in some public sector enterprises may be leading to wage increases in the coming period and, consequently, also to rising prices of products manufactured by those enterprises.",
        "They also argued that the heightened current inflation was one of the factors contributing to increasing the wage pressure in the public finance sector.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members, this raised the risk of second-round effects in the time to come.",
        "Moreover, some Council members argued that high wage growth and the increased CPI inflation, due to the mechanism of old-age and disability pension indexation, would increase the expenditure of the state budget in 2009 and in subsequent years, which would be conducive to deepening the deficit of the public finance sector.",
        "In this context it was pointed out that the expected slowdown of economic growth and the ensuing decline in the growth of the central budget tax revenue would also be contributing to increasing the budget deficit.",
        "Other Council members, however, assessed that the high growth of wages was to a large extent connected with the ongoing convergence of the Polish economy with richer EU member states.",
        "They pointed out that wage costs still made a relatively low contribution to the total costs of enterprises, and emphasised that in view of business tendency surveys the percentage of enterprises which reported rising costs of wages as an important factor behind the rising prices of their products remained low.",
        "In the assessment of those Council members, the risk of second-round effects was currently far lower than in the 1970s.",
        "They also argued that increasing employment under tight labour market conditions, at least in the short term, results in lowering the average labour productivity due to: declining capital-to-labour ratio, employing people whose qualifications are lower than those of the already employed and a high share of the services sector (where productivity growth is relatively low) in the employment growth, all of which had a joint effect of raising unit labour costs.",
        "They assessed that the expected activity slowdown in the Polish economy should, with some time lag, lead to curbing the wage growth.",
        "Moreover, some Council members believed that the demands of substantial pay rises in the public finance sector would not be satisfied in the nearest future.",
        "While analysing the exchange rate developments and their impact on the economy, a significant appreciation of the zloty in the recent period was underlined.",
        "It was emphasised that the exchange rate appreciation tightened Poland’s monetary conditions and was conducive to easing the inflationary pressure, as the prices of imported goods denominated in zloty were falling.",
        "In this context it was pointed out that the current zloty exchange rate was stronger than in the June projection based on the NECMOD model and thus future inflation might prove lower than it followed from the projection.",
        "It was argued at the same time that the currently observed zloty exchange rate appreciation would result, with some time lag, in a growing current account deficit.",
        "Some Council members believed that the rising deficit should be curbing inflationary pressure by stepping up the growth of the demand for imported goods at the expense of the demand for domestic goods.",
        "On the other hand, some Council members assessed that the expected slowdown in economic growth in Poland should be conducive to a reduction of the current account deficit.",
        "Some Council members pointed out that the zloty exchange rate appreciation and rising unit labour costs were conducive to worsening financial results of exporters.",
        "They argued that this may lead to a decrease in the scale of investments undertaken by exporting enterprises and, consequently, a decrease in potential GDP growth.",
        "In the opinion of those members, in view of weakening activity in the economies of Poland’s most important trade partners and the ensuing decline in the foreign demand for Polish products, enterprises will react to the worsening of their financial results by raising the prices of products destined for the domestic market, which in turn will be adding to the domestic inflationary pressure.",
        "While addressing the developments in the environment of the Polish economy, the uncertainty concerning the economic situation in the United States, the euro area and the United Kingdom was pointed out.",
        "It was stressed that the decrease in indicators of economic climate in Germany was signalling a deteriorating situation in this economy.",
        "It was assessed that the slowdown of euro-area economic growth may be delayed in time but would certainly come.",
        "It was argued that the cycle of monetary policy easing in the United States most probably came to an end, while in the euro area signals emerged of a monetary policy tightening in the near future.",
        "It was emphasised that in case monetary policy was tightened in the euro area or the United States, an increase of the NBP interest rates would not result in a further widening of the interest rate differential between Poland and those economies.",
        "Some Council members assessed that the global level of interest rates was currently too low, which meant that in order to bring inflation down it was necessary to tighten monetary policy both in the developed and developing economies.",
        "In this context attention was drawn to the dilemmas of central banks facing the risk of stagflation, i.e.",
        "a situation when a decline in economic activity is accompanied by heightened inflation.",
        "The appropriate monetary policy response to a rise in inflation caused by factors independent of the domestic monetary policy was also discussed.",
        "The members of the Council emphasised the lack of structural reforms, including the public finance reform, which are of great importance for shaping the long-term outlook for economic growth and inflation.",
        "In the opinion of the Council members, abandoning the public finance reform may lead to a non-optimal policy mix.",
        "It was also emphasised that without a clearly defined path of harmonising the rates of indirect taxes with the EU requirements and without a detailed liberalisation programme of the energy market, the assessment of future price growth path, particularly as regards administered prices, is problematic.",
        "The Council also discussed an optimal communication policy of the central bank’s decision-making body with the environment with a view to influencing the financial markets expectations as to the future monetary policy.",
        "On this occasion the great importance of the central bank’s communication was stressed for the formation of inflation expectations in the situation when, due to strong and persistent price shocks in the commodity markets, inflation may remain at a heightened level for a longer period.",
        "In this context the Council emphasised that the lack of any precise declaration on the part of the government about the planned date of Poland’s accession to the euro area may in the current situation become a factor impeding the pursuit of the optimal monetary policy.",
        "While considering the interest rate decision, the Council assessed that the probability of inflation remaining above the inflation target in the monetary policy transmission horizon is higher than the probability of inflation running below the target.",
        "This assessment was supported by the inflation outlook presented in the June projection and also by the latest data on inflation and high wage growth outpacing the labour productivity growth.",
        "Such an assessment justified raising interest rates at the current meeting.",
        "The Council also discussed the future path of NBP interest rates.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members bringing inflation down to the target in the medium term may require a further monetary policy tightening in the coming months.",
        "Other Council members, however, argued that a further monetary policy tightening might result in an excessive appreciation of zloty exchange rate.",
        "They pointed out that the increased current inflation was to a large extent the effect of factors beyond the influence of the domestic monetary policy and argued that the expected lowering of the economic growth should be conducive to easing the inflationary pressure.",
        "A motion to raise the key NBP interest rates by 25 basis points was put forward at the meeting and passed.",
        "The Council raised the interest rates to the following levels: the reference rate to 6.00%, the lombard rate to 7.50%, the deposit rate to 4.50% and the rediscount rate to 6.25%.",
        "During the meeting the Monetary Policy Council discussed the outlook for the future inflation developments in the context of the past, current and, primarily, anticipated economic situation.",
        "The discussion at the meeting focused on exchange rate developments and their impact on economic growth, external balance and inflation, the outlook for economic growth in Poland, the labour market situation and the assessment of the risk of second-round effects.",
        "The Council discussed the influence of these factors on future inflation in Poland.",
        "The Council paid close attention to the fact that as a result of the strengthening of the zloty so far, the present level of the exchange rate considerably outstripped that accounted for in the June inflation projection, which is likely to bring inflation down in the future.",
        "At the same time, some members of the Council pointed out that the recently observed appreciation of the zloty might have outpaced the appreciation of the equilibrium exchange rate.",
        "Some members of the Council argued that apart from the continuing interest rates differential between Poland and the euro area and the United States, expectations of further interest rate hikes in Poland, stimulating the inflow of shortterm capital, might also have contributed to zloty strengthening.",
        "Given a low risk premium and favourable fundamentals of the Polish economy, subsequent interest rate hikes may, in the opinion of those members of the Council, bring further strong appreciation of the zloty.",
        "Other members of the Council argued that the anticipated economic slowdown in Poland might contribute to zloty depreciation.",
        "They also reasoned that at present it is difficult to assess whether factors which had led to zloty appreciation were of permanent nature.",
        "Those members pointed out that exchange rate developments are, to a great extent, affected by non-fundamental and external factors whose impact on the exchange rate is hardly predicable.",
        "Therefore, in their opinion, a depreciation of the zloty exchange rate cannot be ruled out.",
        "In the discussion about the consequences of zloty appreciation it was pointed out that it contributed to curbing inflation by decreasing imported inflation, including by easing the impact of oil price growth in the world markets on domestic prices.",
        "Some members of the Council pointed out that the appreciation of the zloty exchange rate surpassing the appreciation of the equilibrium exchange rate might, with a time lag, negatively affect economic activity in Poland by decreasing the competitiveness of Polish exports, which would be conducive to increasing the negative contribution of net exports to GDP growth and might curb corporate investment activity.",
        "In the opinion of those members of the Council, a worsening outlook for Polish exports is signalled by the findings of the NBP’s economic condition survey indicating a marked drop in 2008 Q2 in margins of enterprises manufacturing export products, a fall in the number of export contracts and an appreciation of the actual exchange rate outstripping the appreciation of the average exchange rate ensuring exports profitability declared by enterprises.",
        "Attention was also paid to GUS data on foreign trade deficit in 2007 which after revision proved higher than previously estimated, which was mainly connected with stronger import growth.",
        "In the opinion of some members of the Council this means that zloty appreciation may have a stronger impact on Polish foreign trade than previously estimated.",
        "Those members pointed out that the zloty appreciation will in subsequent  quarters further deepen the foreign trade deficit which would also be influenced by the economic slowdown abroad.",
        "On the other hand, it was pointed out that according to preliminary national accounts data for 2008 Q1 export growth was maintained at a level close to the import growth despite the appreciation of the zloty exchange rate.",
        "It was also indicated that import growth might be connected not only with exchange rate appreciation but also with a strong growth of domestic demand.",
        "It was argued that wage growth outpacing labour productivity growth was also conducive to deteriorating competitiveness of Polish manufacturers.",
        "The Council paid considerable attention to the role of the exchange rate in the conduct of monetary policy.",
        "Some members of the Council argued that in a small open economy, such as the Polish economy, changes in the exchange rate, in particular in relation to the equilibrium exchange rate, contribute significantly to a tightening of monetary conditions and should be taken into account in the decisions about interest rates.",
        "They pointed out that although the exchange rate appreciation is an effective channel of curbing inflation, excessive currency strengthening poses a risk of too severe an economic slowdown and of a worsening external balance.",
        "Other members argued that the recent strong appreciation of the zloty exchange rate could be temporary and therefore changes in the exchange rate should be treated as a neutral factor while taking decisions on interest rate.",
        "Some members of the Council pointed out that due to the specific character of exchange rate markets, the exchange rate can persistently deviate from the equilibrium exchange rate.",
        "While discussing the outlook for economic growth, some members of the Council indicated that June data on lower than expected growth in industrial output, falling growth in retail sales and deteriorating economic conditions indicators in June and July together with information on lower capacity utilization in 2008 Q3 pointed to a gradual slowdown of the economic growth in Poland.",
        "Those members pointed out that limited investment and consequently lower GDP growth might also result from the likely deterioration of profit ratios of enterprises.",
        "Moreover, in the judgment of those members of the Council the second half of 2008 might be expected to see GDP growth below potential output growth which should be conducive to lowering the inflationary pressure.",
        "Yet, other members of the Council pointed out that the scale of the anticipated slowdown was limited and might not be sufficient to bring inflation down to the target over the monetary policy horizon.",
        "Moreover, despite a certain decline, credit aggregates continued to display a high growth rate which, in the opinion of those members, supported the inflationary pressure.",
        "In the discussion about the labour market situation, it was reasoned that high wage growth and growing unit labour costs continued to be major risk factors to inflation in the medium term.",
        "It was indicated that the economic slowdown had not curbed wage pressures yet.",
        "Some members of the Council pointed out that, as suggested by the findings of the NBP’s business tendency survey, the outlook for employment and wage growth deteriorated in 2008 Q3 for the second consecutive time, and employment growth in enterprises was on a downward path.",
        "In the opinion of those members, 2008 H2 might see a gradual softening of the labour market which would be driven by the expected growth in economic activity and a lower scale of Poles’ economic migration abroad.",
        "Some members of the Council also pointed out that an economic slowdown and related decreasing labour demand as well as worsening financial condition of enterprises should contribute to lowering the wage growth.",
        "It was argued during the discussion that heightened current inflation together with adaptive inflation expectations posed a risk of inflation remaining at a relatively high level.",
        "It was also emphasized that the recent heated public debate about the price growth contributed to boosting inflation expectations.",
        "Yet, in the opinion of some members of the Council the impact of inflation expectations on wage growth should decrease together with weakening economic conditions.",
        "In the opinion of those members the recently observed strong appreciation of the zloty exchange rate bringing down inflation expectations constitutes an additional factor reducing the risk of secondround effects.",
        "At the meeting the current inflation developments were also discussed.",
        "It was pointed out that despite the increase in the consumer price index recorded in June (being primarily the result of a higher growth in the prices of food, fuels and certain services), inflation in Poland, similarly as in Slovakia, was the lowest in the region.",
        "It was also emphasized that the 12-month moving average HICP inflation taken into account while assessing the compliance with the Maastricht price stability criterion, despite its increase, still had not exceeded the reference value, which was due to fact that the currently observed rise in inflation is global in character.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that June had seen an increase in all core inflation measures which, in the opinion of some Council members, corroborated growing inflationary pressure.",
        "While analyzing core inflation measures net of food and energy prices, it was emphasized that since mid2006 this indicator had been on a steady rising path, and the June inflation projection pointed to its further growth and persistently high level in 2009.",
        "It was also noted that the past few years had seen core inflation net of food and energy prices running considerably below CPI inflation which, in case this relation continued, might mean the CPI inflation will remain above the inflation target also in 2009 or even beyond.",
        "On the other hand, some members of the Council pointed out that the expected decline in economic growth, the recent strengthening of the exchange rate and the previous interest rate hikes could bring inflation down close to the inflation target in the monetary policy horizon, albeit the expected rise in administered prices would be a factor supporting increased inflation.",
        "While discussing the changes in the external environment of the Polish economy, some members of the Council emphasized persisting uncertainty about the duration of the slowdown in the world economy and its impact on economic growth in Poland.",
        "The data on the United States suggest, in the judgment of those members, that the fiscal impulse implemented in the United States has been largely offset by rising fuel prices and will drive only a short-lived acceleration of economic growth.",
        "According to the latest forecasts, the second half of 2008 should bring further slowdown in the US economy which might continue also in 2009.",
        "Moreover, those members pointed to a deteriorating growth outlook in the European economy, particularly in Germany which so far had reported relatively high economic growth.",
        "Some members of the Council pointed out that considering the sources of the currently elevated inflation, central banks pursuing inflation targeting strategy did not aim at bringing inflation down to the target fast as this might result in an excessive decline in economic growth.",
        "In this context, it was pointed out that in Poland the measures which could lower the inflationary pressure and consequently reduce the costs of bringing inflation down to the target were structural reforms, including the reform of public finances.",
        "The reform of public finances should limit the procyclicality of fiscal policy.",
        "Potential further increases in interest rates were discussed at the meeting.",
        "Some members of the Council emphasized that the risk of inflation expectations being maintained at a heightened level and a strong rise in wages and unit labour costs combined with the anticipated only slight slowdown in economic activity weighted in favour of increasing interest rates at the July meeting.",
        "It was argued that the outlook for inflationary processes was largely affected by the developments in real interest rates which, despite the previous interest rate increases, continued to fall.",
        "Yet, the majority of the Council members judged that the strong appreciation of the zloty exchange rate, the expected softening of the labour market and the anticipated slowdown in economic growth coupled with the already implemented interest rate hikes would constitute factors bringing inflation down to the target in the medium term, yet, a more comprehensive assessment of the risk of inflation continuing at a heightened level would be possible after analysing the data to be released in the coming months.",
        "Moreover, those members indicated that too large a scale of interest rate hikes might favour excessive appreciation which, coupled with a deteriorating outlook for economic growth abroad would constitute a risk of a significant weakening of exports and pose a risk of a considerable economic slowdown in Poland and further rising of external imbalance.",
        "These arguments, in the opinion of the majority of the Council members, justified keeping interest rates unchanged at the present meeting.",
        "A motion to raise the key NBP interest rates by 25 basis points was put forward at the meeting.",
        "The motion did not pass.",
        "The Council kept the interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 6.00%, the lombard rate at 7.50%, the deposit rate at 4.50% and the rediscount rate at 6.25%.",
        "During the meeting the Monetary Policy Council discussed the outlook for inflation developments in the context of the past, current and, primarily, anticipated economic situation.",
        "The discussion at the meeting focused on: current inflation developments, including changes in food prices and regulated prices, the outlook for economic growth, situation in the labour market and the level of interest rates in Poland and abroad.",
        "While discussing current inflation developments, it was pointed out that as a result of the annual revision of the CPI basket, the inflation data for January had been significantly revised downwards (from 4.3% y/y to 4.0% y/y).",
        "It was also emphasised that in February inflation was significantly below expectations despite a rise up to 4.2% y/y.",
        "Lower than expected growth in prices in February was driven – apart from the revision of the CPI basket – by lower than expected growth in food and fuel prices.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members, a significant downward revision of the January inflation, together with markedly lower than expected inflation in February, allowed to assume that inflation might return within the limit for deviations from the NBP‘s inflation target sooner than accounted for in the February inflation projection.",
        "When addressing the decline in the annual growth of food prices observed in February, some Council members pointed out that the decline had also been recorded in other countries of the region, which might suggest that the strong growth in food prices experienced since mid-2007 was beginning to slow down.",
        "A decline in the growth of food prices in the coming period is also suggested by prices of futures contracts in the world food markets, which reflect favourable forecasts of this year’s crops.",
        "Other members of the Council pointed out that, due to the expectations that crops in 2008 would be higher than in 2007, prices of certain food products and agricultural commodities might even be expected to decline in 2008-2009.",
        "It was pointed out that the rise in the annual inflation in February 2008 in relation to January 2008 was primarily driven by a strong growth in regulated prices.",
        "It was underlined that the CPI excluding regulated prices fell in February 2008 as compared to January 2008.",
        "Some members of the Monetary Policy Council indicated that regulated prices would be a major factor driving inflation in Poland both in 2008 and probably in the subsequent years.",
        "This is mainly related to the expected considerable rise in energy prices, which will result from the probable convergence of gas prices in Poland to those in other EU countries and from the need of the power generating sector to raise funds to finance the necessary investment (connected with a possible electricity shortage) and to cover the expenses incurred by the environmental protection regulations.",
        "Some Council members, however, pointed out that the ongoing liberalisation of the energy sector might curb the growth of energy prices.",
        "While discussing the impact of tax policy on consumer price developments, some Council members pointed out that the adjustment of excise duty and VAT rates to the EU regulations, which is to take place after the expiration of the transition periods negotiated by Poland, might be an important factor driving inflation in Poland in the years to come.",
        "Nevertheless, it was emphasised that the  timing of changes in indirect taxes is uncertain.",
        "The Council also paid attention to the fact that changes in indirect taxes might be of importance for Poland as regards its compliance with the Maastricht price stability criterion.",
        "In this context the members of the Council pointed to the need to appropriately coordinate the fiscal and monetary policies in the period preceding Poland’s accession to the euro area.",
        "When discussing net core inflation, some members of the Council argued that its strong rise in February was primarily the result of a surge in administered prices.",
        "Therefore, at least for a certain period of time, this measure may reflect the inflationary pressure stemming from changes in domestic demand only to a limited extent.",
        "Other members pointed out that a rise in the demand pressure is most clearly visible in some parts of the services sector.",
        "It was also argued that the growth in prices of market services had already been following an upward trend for a longer period, and its one-off drop in mid-2007 resulted from the way in which price promotions were accounted for in the price index.",
        "Some Council members emphasised that a significant rise in administered prices, combined with previously recorded strong increases in food and fuel prices, might translate into a rise in perceived inflation and thus boost inflationary expectations of households.",
        "In this context, they pointed out that the monetary policy should account for the related increased risk of second-round effects.",
        "While assessing the outlook for economic growth in Poland, it was pointed out that the growth of retail sales and industrial output in February were significantly higher then expected.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members, these data confirmed the continuation of strong activity in the Polish economy in 2008 Q1 suggesting, at the same time, that the global economic slowdown had thus far not deteriorated economic climate in Poland.",
        "Some members of the Council pointed out that GDP growth would remain at a relatively high level unless the negative impact of the slowdown in the world economy on the economic growth in Poland would rise.",
        "Certain members of the Council argued that in view of the estimates of potential GDP growth in Poland this meant that the output gap would remain positive in the coming period, which would, in turn, call for a further tightening of the monetary policy.",
        "It was also pointed out that despite previous interest rate increases high growth of credit aggregates continues, including growth of consumption loans granted to households.",
        "Other members of the Council pointed out that the data on GDP in 2007 Q4 confirmed that, from the point of view of inflationary pressure, the structure of economic growth continued to be favourable and was better then expected (lower growth of domestic demand, including primarily lower growth of private consumption and lower negative contribution of net exports to GDP growth together with higher investment growth).",
        "They argued that if GDP growth in 2008 proved higher than assumed in the Budget Act, then the budget deficit, similarly to 2007, might be markedly lower than assumed, which would, in turn, curb inflationary pressure.",
        "During the discussion it was pointed out that 2007 Q4 brought a decline in enterprises’ profitability rate of gross turnover.",
        "Some Council members argued that this might result in enterprises assessing their financial condition less favourably, which amid growing production costs might urge them to increase prices of their products.",
        "Other members of the Council pointed out that deteriorating financial results of enterprises, combined with possible tightening of banks’ lending policies, might result in lowering investment of enterprises and, in consequence, lead to a decline in GDP growth.",
        "When analysing the situation in the labour market, it was pointed out that the data on wages in the enterprise sector in February were higher then expected, and the growth of employment remained at a high level.",
        "Some members of the Council indicated that the currently observed wage rise had been very high both in nominal and real terms as compared to that of the past few years, which confirmed persistently strong wage pressure in the economy.",
        "It was also emphasised that the dynamic growth in wages exceeded labour productivity growth, resulting in a further increase in unit labour costs.",
        "While discussing external factors affecting the Polish economy, it was pointed out that uncertainty persisted as to the growth outlook for the global economy.",
        "Some members of the Council indicated that forecasts of the economic growth in the United States had recently been revised downwards despite a considerable easing in monetary and fiscal policies.",
        "The situation deteriorated also in the euro area, while in the opinion of some Council members, the pace of this process might indicate that economic slowdown in the euro area was not only driven by the recession in the United States but also by weak domestic demand in the euro area.",
        "Some members argued that a decline in the global economic growth, and particularly in the growth of Western European countries, might negatively affect the growth of Polish exports and, consequently, might lead to a decline in GDP growth in Poland.",
        "At the same time, faced with the uncertainty about the possibility of selling their products abroad, enterprises may limit their investment activity, which might also have a negative impact on GDP growth.",
        "Other members of the Council indicated that the negative impact of the slowdown in the world economy on the economic situation in Poland might be mitigated by the changing geographical structure of Polish foreign trade.",
        "When discussing the monetary policy it was pointed out that too strong policy tightening, combined with interest rates cuts by the US Federal Reserve and the ECB interest rates kept unchanged, may be conducive to the inflow of speculative capital to Poland and to an excessive exchange rate appreciation.",
        "In turn, such an excessive strengthening of the zloty may lead to deteriorating the competitiveness of the Polish foreign trade, which amid a slowdown in the world economy may result in a decline in the growth of Polish exports and GDP.",
        "In this context, some Council members emphasised that possible consequences of a further increase in the interest rate disparity for the zloty exchange rate should be taken into consideration while taking decisions on interest rates.",
        "While addressing the issue of the exchange rate, some Council members argued that despite the recently observed appreciation of the zloty, it should be treated neutrally in taking monetary policy decisions due to the possible considerable fluctuations of the exchange rate.",
        "After discussion, it was assessed that primarily the following factors point to a significant probability of inflation remaining above the inflation target in the medium term: the continuation of the fast economic growth, probably exceeding the growth of potential GDP, significant surge in wages and employment and the risk of higher inflation expectations due to heightened current inflation and expected further growth in regulated prices.",
        "In the Council’s assessment, these arguments justified monetary policy tightening at the current meeting.",
        "Members of the Council also discussed the scale and pace of the needed monetary policy tightening.",
        "A motion to raise the key NBP interest rates by 50 basis points was put forward.",
        "The motion did not pass.",
        "A motion to raise the key NBP interest rates by 25 basis points was put forward and passed.",
        "The Council raised the interest rates to the following levels: the reference rate to 5.75%, the lombard rate to 7.25%, the deposit rate to 4.25% and the rediscount rate to 6.00%."

    "2007": [
        "During its meeting, the Monetary Policy Council discussed the outlook for inflation in the context of the past, current and, primarily, anticipated economic situation.",
        "The main topics discussed at the meeting were: labour market situation, the outlook for inflation outlined in the inflation projection and the zloty exchange rate developments.",
        "Some Council members pointed out that 2007 Q2 brought acceleration in the pace of wage growth in enterprises, which remained higher than labour productivity growth leading to growth in unit labour costs in this sector.",
        "Those members also emphasised that the share of labour costs in the costs of enterprises had been falling for a few years and that now this tendency might have reversed.",
        "In their opinion, if the rise in unit labour costs is not accompanied by a rise in the prices of products manufactured by enterprises, their financial results will worsen, which would weaken their propensity to invest to a larger extent than it would be the case if the weakening was the result of increased cost of credit in connection to interest rate increases.",
        "If, on the other hand, the rise in labour costs is passed through to prices, this will lead to higher inflation.",
        "A high wage growth in enterprises can also lead to accelerated wage growth in the public sector, where only slight productivity growth was observed, which would be conducive to increased inflation.",
        "Other Council members argued that it was not only the growth rate of unit labour costs that should be considered but also their level.",
        "In their opinion, the level of unit labour costs in Poland was currently relatively low, which resulted in very good financial results of enterprises allowing them to absorb growing labour costs without the need to raise their prices.",
        "Those members also pointed out that the findings of corporate survey did not reveal strong build-up in wage pressure in the nearest future and that, according to these survey, only a very small share of enterprises signalled a rise in the prices of their products in response to the growing wages.",
        "The same members also emphasised that the decisions taken by the Government increasing the accessibility to the Polish labour market for workers from countries to the east of Poland, together with the increased geographical mobility of Poles, should be conducive to curbing the wage pressure in the economy.",
        "Some Council members indicated that the currently observed strongly growing demand in the product market, amid a limited growth in domestic supply, will lead to increased inflation.",
        "In the assessment of those members, a strong demand pressure was, among others, reflected in the continuously high growth of retail sales.",
        "Other members, however, pointed out that the observed economic growth was currently slowing down, which should ease the demand pressure in the economy.",
        "Moreover, those members emphasised that a significant contribution to GDP growth was made by investments, which increased the capital stock and thus contributed to the rise in the potential output and labour productivity.",
        "The potential output was also positively affected by a considerable inflow of foreign direct investment.",
        "They pointed out too that the observed wage build-up and the reduction in the disability pension contribution may be conducive to an increased supply of labour.",
        "Overall, the rise in the capital stock and labour supply should, in the opinion of these members, increase the potential output and thus curb the inflationary pressure.",
        "They also argued that the rapid growth in domestic demand would be partially absorbed by growth in imports, which should contain the pressure for price growth.",
        "Moreover, the same members pointed out that a fast growth in retail sales mainly applies to durable goods treated as quasi-investments (cars, furniture, radio and television equipment and household appliances), the prices of which do not rise.",
        "Another topic raised at the meeting was the outlook for inflation outlined in inflation projection based on the ECMOD model and the results of other forecasts conducted at the NBP.",
        "Some Council members emphasised that the inflation forecasts used at the NBP pointed to a higher inflation path than it had been forecasted a quarter before.",
        "According to the central projection based on the ECMOD model, in 2009 CPI inflation would approach the upper limit for deviations from the inflation target (3.5%), while core net inflation would actually reach this level.",
        "In the assessment of those members, should there additionally occur a negative shock in the food or fuel market, CPI inflation would rise in 2009 markedly above the upper limit for deviations from the inflation target.",
        "Moreover, the discussants pointed out that, in the projection horizon, the estimated probability of inflation breaching the upper limit for deviations from the inflation target was on the rise.",
        "At the same time, they believed that the anti-inflationary impact of the already implemented and scheduled reduction of the disability pension contribution would not be as large as accounted for in the projection.",
        "Other members argued that, in line with the central projection based on the ECMOD model, inflation remained within the band for deviations from the inflation target throughout the projection horizon.",
        "They also pointed out that the results of other forecasts conducted at the NBP pointed to a lower inflation path than the ECMOD-based projection, while one of the forecasts actually pointed to inflation decline at the end of the forecast horizon.",
        "Council members discussed the level of interest rates and the impact of monetary policy tightening on economic growth.",
        "Some Council members concluded that increasing the interest rates in Poland to the level markedly higher than euro area level was warranted by a higher level of the neutral interest rate in Poland than in the euro area, which was due to the difference in potential output growth.",
        "Those members also claimed that interest rate increase in Poland should not be limiting the investment growth, as currently investments depended more on the optimistic expectations of entrepreneurs on the sustaining of the strong economic growth than on the level of interest rates.",
        "They also argued that a high level of stock exchange indices in Poland reduced the cost of investment in relation to the market value of enterprises, which favoured enterprises’ decisions to invest.",
        "According to those members, a slight increase in interest rate should not dampen economic growth.",
        "In their opinion, this view is confirmed, among others, by the fact that, despite a rise in the key NBP interest rates in April 2007, the growth of corporate credit continued to step up in June 2007.",
        "The members of the Council paid a lot of attention to the zloty exchange rate.",
        "In this context, attention was drawn both to the impact of fundamental factors and developments in international financial markets, such as the interest rate disparity, developments of the current account balance, changes in net foreign assets of the banking sector, purchases of investment funds abroad, inflow of foreign direct investment, EU funds and transfers from Poles working abroad.",
        "Some Council members pointed out that raising NBP interest rates would lead to appreciation pressure.",
        "Other members, however, did not share this opinion.",
        "Council members could not agree as to the impact of the April and June interest rate increases on the exchange rate of the zloty.",
        "The members of the Council also discussed the outlook for inflation in the context of developments of the real effective exchange rate of the zloty and its impact on the competitiveness of the Polish economy.",
        "Some members quoted the examples of some EU countries which experienced wage growths exceeding the growth of labour productivity amid a stable nominal exchange rate, which -2 led to a strong appreciation of the real effective exchange rate of their currencies and the loss of competitiveness of these countries.",
        "In the opinion of those Council members, if wage growth was allowed to outpace the growth of productivity, the competitiveness of Polish economy might suffer as a result.",
        "In consequence, the rate of economic growth would fall, diminishing the investment attractiveness of the Polish economy and leading to a decrease in the inflow of foreign direct investment.",
        "Council members emphasised the favourable performance of the central government budget in 2007 Q2.",
        "Some Council members also pointed out that the reduction in the disability pension contribution would mean transferring some funds from the public to the private sector, the latter having higher propensity to save than the former, which should be conducive to reducing demand and, consequently, to curbing the inflationary pressure.",
        "Council members also pointed out that inflation was still offset by the drop in the prices of goods from low costs countries.",
        "The Council also discussed the outlook for food and energy prices.",
        "Council members emphasised that the inflation expectations of households declined for another consecutive month.",
        "Some members were convinced that both the outlook for inflation outlined in the inflation projection and the macroeconomic data indicated that the probability of inflation running above target was still significantly higher than the probability of its running below target, which – in their opinion – warranted the interest rate increase.",
        "Additionally, the same members suggested that it was probable that Poland would join the ERM II in 2010.",
        "If inflation overshot the inflation target at that point, this could hinder the stabilisation of the exchange rate within the ERM II.",
        "The Council also discussed the right time for a possible further tightening of monetary policy.",
        "Some Council members were of the opinion that the decision to raise interest rate should be taken at the July meeting, as this would follow from the results of the inflation projection based on the ECMOD model published in July.",
        "It was also suggested that a better assessment of the risk of inflation overshooting the inflation target in the monetary policy transmission horizon would require macroeconomic data that were to be released before the next meeting.",
        "Thus, it was suggested to suspend the decision to raise the interest rates.",
        "Considering the results of the other forecasts conducted at the NBP, which did not point to a risk of inflation overshooting the inflation target, other Council members came to the conclusion that there were no grounds for a further monetary policy tightening.",
        "They also pointed out that it was not yet clear when Poland would join the ERM II and so the considerations connected with ERM II membership should not be taken into account in current interest rate decisions.",
        "Additionally, they emphasised that a monetary policy tightening may lead to zloty appreciation, increase expectations for further interest rate increases and, consequently, dampen economic growth.",
        "At the meeting a motion to raise the key NBP interest rates by 25 basis points was put forward.",
        "The motion did not pass.",
        "The Council kept the interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 4.50%, the lombard rate at 6.00%, the deposit rate at 3.00% and the rediscount rate at 4.75%.",
        "During its meeting, the Monetary Policy Council discussed the outlook for inflation in the context of the past, current and, primarily, expected economic situation.",
        "The main issue discussed at the meeting was the prospects of economic growth and their impact on inflation.",
        "Some Council members pointed out that the rate of GDP growth in Poland still exceeds the growth rate of potential output, leading to a widening of the output gap and a build-up in inflationary pressure.",
        "They assessed that in the nearest future the high rate of domestic demand growth will be sustained.",
        "Strong growth in demand will be supported by a considerable rise in nominal wages and employment, the inflow of transfers of earnings by people working abroad, strong lending growth, including accelerating rise in consumer loans, and an increase in disposable income of households due to a cut in disability pension contributions.",
        "Those members assessed that in the conditions of the currently high production capacity utilisation, the dynamic growth of domestic demand creates a significant risk of inflation growing above the inflation target in the medium term.",
        "Other Council members emphasised that the structure of the current economic growth is still advantageous, with a growing share of investment, including greenfield foreign direct investments, which raises the economy’s innovativeness.",
        "This should lead to an increase in labour productivity and production potential of the economy and therefore constrain the inflationary pressure related to swift economic growth.",
        "These members also pointed out that the growth in disposable income of households does not necessarily have to lead to consumption growth, if it will be accompanied by a rise in this sector’s savings.",
        "They also assessed that a part of domestic demand growth will be absorbed by growing imports, which should limit the pressure for price growth.",
        "Moreover, those members pointed out that a drop in industrial production, construction and assembly production and retail sales, which was recorded in May, is a sign of a lower GDP growth in 2007 Q2.",
        "Some members of the Council also assessed that in the case of the expected lower rate of economic growth and a strong surge in potential output, GDP growth should not outpace the growth of potential output in the nearest future.",
        "During its meeting the Council also discussed the labour market situation.",
        "Some Council members pointed to a continually high rate of wage growth and to a very fast drop in unemployment, facilitating a further strong rise in wages.",
        "They indicated that strong wage growth in enterprises is accompanied by increasing wage pressure in the public sector, which is reflected in industrial actions.",
        "Those members pointed out that, despite the uncertainty concerning the unit labour costs, all available estimates of these costs obtained with the use of various calculation methods, indicate a worsening relationship between wage and labour productivity growth, which could lead to inflation increase.",
        "Those members pointed out that acceleration in price growth should also be fuelled by the rise in households’ disposable income resulting from the increase in wages, which should support the growth of consumption demand.",
        "They argued that, in the coming period, the rise in households' income related to an increase in aggregate wages will be strengthened by the cut in disability pension contributions, which will additionally contribute to net wage growth, fostering a relatively higher growth in consumption.",
        "In the course of the discussion, it was pointed out that, by leading to net wage growth, the reduction of disability pension contributions should limit the pressure for further gross wage and labour cost increases in the longer term.",
        "Some Council members pointed out that, despite a considerable decrease, the unemployment rate in Poland is still high, which should also contain wage growth.",
        "Moreover, they assessed that the growth in unit labour costs should be constrained by the continuation of high productivity growth related to increased investment outlays, enterprises’ restructuring and improving quality of the labour force.",
        "According to those Council members, at the moment it is difficult to assess whether the May slowdown in labour productivity growth in industry will prove permanent.",
        "Moreover, those members emphasised that a rise in unit labour costs does not have to lead to inflation growth, as the increase in competition connected, among other things, with the globalisation processes reduces enterprises’ pricing power and, thus, their ability to pass the rising costs onto customers.",
        "They also pointed out that the observed high wage growth creates incentives to work for inactive people, which may contribute to an increase in labour supply and potential output.",
        "Those members also indicated that growing labour costs, amid the persistently high demand, might encourage enterprises to undertake investments aimed at replacing labourintensive technologies with capital-intensive ones.",
        "They assessed that owing to, among others, a very good financial situation, enterprises have a considerable ability to undertake this kind of restructuring measures.",
        "The discussion also concerned the public finance situation.",
        "Some Council members indicated that one of important risk factors for inflation growth is a procyclical fiscal policy, which is reflected, among others, in the reduction in the disability pension contribution.",
        "They assessed that the rise of wage pressure in the public sector poses risk to sustaining the budget anchor.",
        "Those members emphasised that an overly expansive fiscal policy in the conditions of increasing inflationary pressure could lead to a policy-mix which is unfavourable from the point of view of long-term economic growth.",
        "Other Council members pointed out that the situation of the state budge is very favourable at the moment and that future fiscal policy is subject to considerable uncertainty related, among others, to the Government’s response to increased wage pressure in the public sector.",
        "They pointed out that, despite a significant risk of a fiscal policy loosening, at present it is difficult to assess the impact of this policy on inflation in the medium term.",
        "Referring to current inflation indicators, some Council members indicated that, despite the rapid economic growth, core inflation has remained low for a long time, which might be an indication of a low inflationary pressure.",
        "It was also pointed out that in the next few months inflation will most probably decrease.",
        "Other Council members, however, emphasised that there is a lag between a rise in economic activity and inflation growth.",
        "Furthermore, they pointed out that keeping CPI inflation at the inflation target might require core inflation to run at a lower level.",
        "Another issue discussed at the meeting were monetary developments.",
        "Some Council members pointed out that a very fast credit growth may contribute to further growth in domestic demand and accumulation of inflationary pressure, among others, in the asset market.",
        "Other members of the Council assessed that the relation of credit to GDP is still low in Poland and that the observed rapid growth in lending is to a large extent the result of the process of Poland’s catching up with countries at a higher level of development.",
        "One of the topics addressed at the meeting was the impact of zloty exchange rate on inflation.",
        "In this context, the influence of fundamental factors as well as trends in the international financial markets was considered, including, among others, interest rate disparity, current account balance, outlook for economic growth, inflow of foreign direct investment, EU funds and transfers of earnings made by economic migrants as well as global liquidity and investment strategies of world financial market participants.",
        "In this context, some Council members indicated that raising NBP interest rates could give rise to appreciation pressure, which, in turn, might contribute to weakening exports and deepening the foreign trade deficit.",
        "Other members disagreed with this opinion and pointed to a low interest rates disparity in relation to the ECB rate.",
        "To substantiate this claim, they indicated that the April hike did not bring about appreciation pressure.",
        "Some discussants pointed out that one of the factors that should favour inflation stabilisation in Poland is a bright outlook for global inflation resulting from a credible monetary policy pursued by the largest central banks.",
        "At the same time, they quoted the rise of commodity and food prices in the world markets, related to the impact of structural factors, as a risk factor for the growth of global inflation.",
        "In the assessment of some Council members, the current interest rate of the NBP has probably been below the natural rate and thus it has not prevented the build-up of inflationary pressure.",
        "They pointed out that many central banks are raising their interest rates at the moment.",
        "Other members of the Council, however, argued that the estimates of the natural interest rates are subject to a considerable uncertainty.",
        "Among Council members the opinion prevailed that, due to the accumulation of factors leading to inflationary pressure building up in the economy, sustaining inflation at a level consistent with the target in the medium term requires a monetary policy tightening in the nearest future.",
        "The members of the Council, however, differed in their views concerning the optimal moment for the interest rate rise.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members, the assessment of the balance of risks for future inflation did not provide clear grounds for tightening the monetary policy at the current meeting.",
        "They argued that the NBP inflation projection to be published in July 2007 could be a useful tool in assessing the inflation outlook in the monetary policy transmission horizon.",
        "It was also pointed out that an NBP interest rate hike that would come earlier than expected by the market could give rise to expectations for faster and higher interest rate rises, which could result in a stronger decrease in the rate of economic growth than necessary for stabilising inflation at the target level in the medium term.",
        "Other Council members, however, assessed that the potential costs of delaying the interest rate rise outweighed possible benefits related to postponing the decision to change monetary policy parameters.",
        "In particular, it was emphasised that in the conditions of a globalisation-related weakening of the short-term relation between domestic economic activity and domestic inflation and amid the adaptive nature of inflation expectations in Poland, the cost of a monetary policy tightening which would ensure the return of inflation to the target would be considerably higher than the cost of preventing inflation growth.",
        "Moreover, some Council members assessed that a monetary policy tightening in the face of alarming signals from the public finance sector would strengthen the credibility of the pursued monetary policy.",
        "During the meeting, a motion to raise the key NBP interest rates by 25 basis points was put forward and passed.",
        "The Council raised the interest rates to the following levels: the reference rate to 4.50%, the lombard rate to 6.00%, the deposit rate to 3.00% and the rediscount rate to 4.75%.",
        "During the meeting the Monetary Policy Council discussed the outlook for inflation in the context of the past, current and, primarily, anticipated economic situation.",
        "The discussion at the meeting focused on: the impact of the turmoil in the international financial markets on the outlook for economic growth, labour market situation in Poland, external imbalance and public finance situation.",
        "The Council discussed the influence of these factors on the future inflation in Poland.",
        "The members of the Council devoted a lot of attention to the situation in international financial markets and discussed the impact of increased uncertainty on the outlook of economic growth in the global and Polish economies.",
        "Some discussants pointed out that the Polish financial sector is safe from turmoil similar to that which occurred in the United States and Western Europe in August and September 2007.",
        "They argued that in Poland, in contrast to the United States, mortgage loans are only granted by institutions remaining under the banking supervision and that the domestic market does not offer as complex financial instruments as those available in the markets which experienced the turbulences.",
        "Other discussants pointed out that the turmoil in international financial markets did spread beyond the US subprime loan market, which can be evidenced by problems in the German and British financial markets.",
        "They also pointed out that if the problems in the US housing market exacerbate, this situation combined with the appreciation of the euro may dampen euro area growth.",
        "They also assessed that the heightened uncertainty may persist for the next few months, as the necessary adjustment in the structure of assets and liabilities of international financial institutions would proceed gradually.",
        "It was also emphasised that in the face of turmoil some central banks decided to ease or restrain further monetary policy tightening and adopt a wait-and-see strategy observing the developments in the financial markets and in the real economy.",
        "While discussing the outlook for economic growth, it was underlined that due to the financial market turbulences the forecasts of economic growth were lowered for the United States, while in Europe there was a decline in business confidence indicators.",
        "It was argued that if the economic growth in the external environment of the Polish economy fell short of previous expectations, then lower growth of Polish exports should be expected and, consequently, also lower economic growth and lower inflationary pressure.",
        "It was also pointed out that GDP growth was approaching the growth of potential output, while the structure of economic growth was still very favourable from the point of view of the inflation outlook due to the increased investment of enterprises.",
        "Other Council members pointed out that deceleration of economic activity in Europe would not have to translate into lowering of the Polish exports growth, since in the past, in a period of low economic growth, the Western European countries – especially Germany, which absorbed a major part of Polish exports – had increased demand for relatively cheap products from Poland.",
        "In the assessment of those members, the current data indicated that the Polish economy remained in the  9 Wars zawa ulicaperiod of strong growth and that the output gap was positive, which was conducive to raising the inflationary pressure.",
        "While discussing the stability of the financial sector, some discussants emphasised that the funding of the Polish economy was based to a larger extent on the banking market than on the capital market and that the property structure of banks was dominated by foreign capital.",
        "It was pointed out that it could not be ruled out that potential problems of international financial institutions with capital links to Polish banks might affect the condition of the Polish financial sector.",
        "In this context, the issue of separating the banking supervision from the central bank was raised, which in case of turmoil in the financial market may impede the coordination of the measures taken by the central bank and the banking supervision.",
        "Moreover, some discussants pointed to a high growth in loans to households and to the increased share of consumption loans in total households’ loans.",
        "In the assessment of those discussants, the rapid credit expansion combined with the liberalisation of loan granting criteria may be conducive to deterioration of the credit portfolio of banks, which may prove – along with risks originating in international financial markets – an additional threat to the stability of the Polish financial system.",
        "Furthermore, the high growth of loans indicated that the growth of domestic demand may be faster than the growth of potential GDP, which could increase the inflationary pressure.",
        "In the opinion of those discussants, the pursued monetary policy should counteract the excessive lending growth.",
        "Other members of the Council argued, however, that high growth of loans did not have to mean a deterioration of the quality of banks’ credit portfolios, as it resulted from the improved creditworthiness of households related to their increased disposable income, higher employment and lower unemployment rate.",
        "During the meeting it was pointed out that the year-on-year inflation in August clearly undershot the target.",
        "Some members emphasised that the inflation decrease in August was deeper than it had been forecasted.",
        "Other members pointed out the decrease in inflation was connected with the reduction of prices of internet services that month and that the effects of this reduction would fade out at the beginning of 2008.",
        "The rising growth of food prices was also emphasised.",
        "Another point under discussion was the possible impact of the annual adjustment of the CPI basket on inflation, which is scheduled for early 2008.",
        "While discussing the situation in the labour market it was pointed out that the relation between the growth of wages and the growth of labour productivity was worsening.",
        "Some Council members pointed out that the rise in unit labour costs, and thus also in the costs of enterprises, might lead to worsening their profitability and a decline in the international competitiveness of the economy.",
        "Those members claimed that wage growth in Poland was very high in comparison to the majority of Central and Eastern European countries.",
        "In the opinion of those Council members, in the nearest future a deceleration of the wage growth should not be expected, as despite a relatively high unemployment rate in Poland, enterprises experienced increasing difficulties in finding new employees.",
        "Those members assessed that labour market data signalled building-up inflationary pressure in the Polish economy.",
        "They also argued that even in case of deceleration of the economic growth, the wage growth in Poland may remain at a high level contributing to the rise in inflation.",
        "Other Council members were of the opinion that wage growth exceeding growth of labour productivity should not prove permanent, as at some point it is bound to negatively affect the financial results of companies.",
        "It was emphasised that the share of wage costs in total costs remained at a low and stable level, which meant that enterprises would not have to increase their prices in response to wage growth acceleration.",
        "It was pointed out that enterprises had been undergoing intensive restructuring over the past few years, which had contributed to the observed improvement in the financial results and financial liquidity of this sector.",
        "Moreover, it was also pointed out that the accumulated wage growth in Poland over the past few years was markedly lower compared to the neighbouring countries at a similar level of development.",
        "It was also emphasised that the fast growth in unit labour costs in the economy had not as yet led to a significant inflation increase.",
        "It was claimed that this situation resulted from good financial results of enterprises, which allowed them to absorb the rising wage costs, fierce price competition related to the globalisation and increased flexibility of supply stemming from lower costs of increasing production capacities.",
        "It was pointed out that the inflationary pressure was also curbed by increased domestic savings (as evidenced by the inflow of assets to investment funds), higher imports contributing to the rise of the current account deficit and zloty appreciation.",
        "The members of the Council also discussed Poland’s balance of payments.",
        "It was emphasised that the Forecast of the Balance of Payments of the Republic of Poland for the year 2008, which was adopted during the meeting, pointed to a building-up of the external imbalance of Poland.",
        "It was highlighted that though a moderate current account deficit was typical of the economies in the period of real convergence, it was a cause for concern that the forecasted ratio of this deficit to GDP was rising fast.",
        "It was pointed out that if the relation between wage growth and productivity growth continued to deteriorate, the international competitiveness of the Polish economy would worsen, which would be conducive to raising the external imbalance.",
        "Other Council members assessed that in the nearest future a build-up in the current account deficit should not be significantly increasing the macroeconomic risk of the Polish economy, as in the globalised economy it was possible to finance larger current account deficits than in the past.",
        "Moreover, Poland’s membership in the European Union contributed to a significant reduction of the country’s macroeconomic risk.",
        "The Council also discussed the situation of public finance.",
        "Some Council members pointed out that despite the early parliamentary elections and the ensuing increase in some of the state budget expenditures in 2008, the so-called budget anchor had been preserved.",
        "Other members, however, assessed that the spending of the public finance sector as a whole had increased significantly in 2007 and their structure had become more rigid.",
        "It was also argued that the recently introduced changes to the public finance would be deteriorating this sector’s situation not only in 2008 but primarily in the following years.",
        "Additionally, it was emphasised that the public finance situation could worsen significantly in the event of economic slowdown.",
        "The members of the Council agreed that it was difficult at the moment to assess the duration of the increased uncertainty in the international financial markets or its impact on the global and, consequently, Polish real economy.",
        "They also concluded that the data to be published in the nearest future, both those concerning the domestic economy and those coming from the international markets should be very carefully analysed.",
        "In the Council’s assessment, in the medium term the probability of inflation running above the inflation target had decreased to a certain degree due to the previously implemented monetary policy tightening and thus it was not necessary to change the interest rates at that meeting.",
        "The Council kept the interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 4.75%, the lombard rate at 6.25%, the deposit rate at 3.25% and the rediscount rate at 5.00%.",
        "During the meeting the Monetary Policy Council discussed the outlook for inflation in the context of the past, current and, primarily, anticipated economic situation.",
        "The main topics raised at the meeting were the turbulences in international financial markets and their impact on the outlook for economic growth, the labour market situation in Poland and the public finance situation.",
        "The Council discussed the influence of these factors on the future inflation in Poland.",
        "Some Council members pointed out that both the current and forecast inflation were close to the inflation target, while core net inflation had remained for a longer period close to the lower limit for deviations from the inflation target.",
        "Such developments of core inflation warranted caution in monetary policy and abstaining from a decision to change the interest rates.",
        "Other members emphasised that the year-on-year drop in core inflation in July was connected with a significant increase in telecommunication services prices one year before.",
        "Apart from that, they argued that the rising growth of prices of services was an indication of an intensifying Balassa-Samuelson effect.",
        "They also pointed out that oil prices in the world markets remained above the levels assumed in the July projection.",
        "The members of the Council discussed the turmoil in international financial market observed in August 2007 and its impact on the outlook for global and Polish economies.",
        "Some members pointed out that the turbulences in financial markets resulted in lowering forecasts of economic growth in the United States and Europe.",
        "Though, at the moment, it is difficult to assess the scale of impact those problems will have on the US economy, it can be expected that the forecasts of economic growth in the external environment of the Polish economy will be further decreased.",
        "It was argued that if economic growth in the United States and Europe fell short of previous expectations, then smaller exports of Poland should be expected, resulting in lower economic growth and lower inflationary pressure.",
        "In view of the above factors, it was recommended to remain cautious, abstain from the decision to change interest rates at the August meeting and adopt a \"wait and see\" approach, following the example of some other central banks.",
        "It was pointed out that delaying the decision to raise the interest rate would not have any significant impact on monetary policy effect on inflation.",
        "On the other hand, other Council members emphasised that the financial disturbances have a strong influence on the global economy when they are accompanied by a significant and long-lasting decline of stock prices.",
        "Such a situation occurred in 2000, when stock exchange indices slumped, among others, due to decreased confidence in the reliability of companies’ financial reporting.",
        "In the opinion of those members, the turbulences observed in August were similar to those which occurred back in 1998, when they were rooted in the financial markets themselves.",
        "Those upheavals had not had any significant impact on the situation of the enterprise sector nor had they dampened significantly economic growth in the United States.",
        "Moreover, the August turmoil in the global financial market did not affect the financial market in Poland.",
        "It was emphasised that some central banks decided to raise their interest rates in the face of financial market turmoil.",
        "In the opinion of these members, a halt in monetary policy tightening in Poland, due to disruptions in international financial markets, might suggest that the National Bank of Poland would in future ease monetary policy in the event of problems resulting from financial institutions incurring excessive risk, which could increase moral hazard.",
        "It was also argued that currently the economic growth in Poland is primarily driven by domestic demand and thus the impact of economic growth in the external environment of the Polish economy on GDP growth is currently lower than it used to be.",
        "While addressing the developments in the labour market, some Council members pointed out that in 2007 Q2 the growth of unit labour costs in the economy was significantly higher than forecast in the July projection.",
        "Those members pointed also out that a rapid growth of wages in the enterprise sector had been sustained in 2007 July, which signalled that wage growth in the economy would remain high in 2007 Q3.",
        "Those members also argued that the acceleration in wage growth was spreading to a growing number of industries and sectors of the economy.",
        "It was emphasised that the higher than previously expected increase in the minimum wage which was announced by the government would be a factor conducive to higher wage growth.",
        "It was also pointed out that the high wage growth would be supported by the fast and higher than forecast drop in the unemployment rate, which fell – in the assessment of those members – below the NAWRU.",
        "Those members believed that the persistence of the excessively rapid wage growth in the economy would after a lag lead to higher inflation.",
        "As a result, this may diminish the competitiveness of Polish exports and, consequently, dampen economic growth in the longer period.",
        "This would also be conducive to rising imbalance in the balance of payments, which would raise the macroeconomic risk of Poland.",
        "Other members of the Council pointed out that, despite the rapid growth of wages in enterprises, July brought a significant drop in the growth of unit labour costs in industry and so the deterioration in the relation between wages and productivity was not perpetuated in this sector.",
        "Moreover, the same members emphasised that over the past few years wage growth in industry had been lower than productivity growth.",
        "These tendencies had to be reversed at some point and thus at the moment wage growth outpaced productivity growth.",
        "It was argued that the wage growth outpacing productivity growth would be limited in time, as at some point it is bound to negatively affect the financial results of companies.",
        "It was emphasised that in the first half of 2007 enterprises reported record high financial results, with the contribution of wage costs in total costs remaining stable and low, which indicated that enterprises did not have to increase their prices in response to wage growth acceleration.",
        "The same members also emphasised that in 2006 and at the beginning of 2007 the growth of unit labour costs in the economy outpaced inflation, yet inflation increased only moderately.",
        "Additionally, those members pointed out that in comparison to the similarly developed neighbouring countries the accumulated wage increase in manufacturing since 2002 had been significantly lower in Poland and the corresponding productivity growth considerably higher than in those countries.",
        "It was argued that the productivity growth in Poland will be fuelled by the dynamically rising investment.",
        "It was also pointed out that, in line with the NBP’s analyses, the growth of unit labour coast in the economy as calculated on the basis of LFS (BAEL) data may in fact be overestimated due to the problems with the BAEL accounting for the effects of increased foreign migration of Polish workers.",
        "During the discussion on economic growth in Poland, some Council members pointed out that the GDP growth in Poland was slowing down, which was confirmed by macroeconomic data and business survey results.",
        "They also emphasised that the high growth in investments and restructuring taking place in enterprises were contributing to the growth of potential GDP, which would be easing inflationary pressure.",
        "They also argued that, in line with the July projection, at the beginning of 2009 the growth of potential GDP may outpace the growth of actual GDP, which would weaken the inflationary impact of strong economic growth.",
        "Other members pointed out that domestic demand was growing faster than GDP leading to a widening current account deficit.",
        "They believed that this deficit remained moderate for the time being, but its increase will make it an important factor affecting the inflation outlook.",
        "It was argued that the statistical data for July 2007 indicated that the strong growth of domestic demand and growing current account deficit would most probably continue in Q3.",
        "In the assessment of those members, a factor supporting the continuation of a rapid growth in consumption demand was – apart from the dynamically rising aggregate wages – a rapid build-up in consumer credit, which kept on stepping up despite two interest rate increases.",
        "The members of the Council also discussed the developments of food prices.",
        "It was pointed out that, despite good crop harvest in Poland, there was an increase in the prices of cereals, which have a considerable impact on the overall food prices.",
        "It was also stressed that there was an unexpected rise in the prices of other food products and a heightened risk of faster food price growth in the world markets.",
        "The members of the Council also devoted a lot of attention to public finance situation.",
        "It was pointed out that the current standing of this sector was favourable.",
        "Still, it was underlined that the announced changes in the way of indexing old-age and disability pensions additionally linking the indexation to wage growth would result in increased public expenditure and higher consumption demand.",
        "It was also argued that the prolongation of old regulations on early retirement may be still conducive to deactivating some part of the labour force and, thus, negatively affect the potential output and step up the wage growth at the same time.",
        "Moreover, in the opinion of some Council members also the reduction in the disability pension contribution under no reduction of public spending would raise the aggregate demand.",
        "It was assessed that the announced changes in the public finance – if implemented – would be leading to a rise in the deficit of the public finance sector and an increase in domestic demand and inflation.",
        "The members of the Council also discussed the exchange rate developments of the zloty.",
        "In this context, both the impact of fundamental factors was emphasised and also of the tendencies in international financial markets, including the current account balance, portfolio capital and direct investment flows, as well as increased uncertainty connected with probable parliamentary elections in Poland.",
        "In the Council’s assessment, in the conditions of increased uncertainty associated with the turmoil in international financial markets, the balance of risks for future inflation pointed to the necessity of a monetary policy tightening.",
        "This was supported by the assessment of inflation outlook carried out on the basis of macroeconomic data and the July inflation projection.",
        "Another important argument for raising the interest rates were the recent decisions leading to a decrease in revenues and an increase in expenditures of the public finance sector, which may lead to a deterioration of the public finance balance and create additional inflationary pressure in the medium term.",
        "A motion to raise the key NBP interest rates by 25 percentage points was put forward at the meeting.",
        "The Council raised the interest rates to the following levels: the reference rate to 4.75%, the lombard rate to 6.25%, the deposit rate to 3.25% and the rediscount rate to 5.00%.",
        "During the meeting, the Monetary Policy Council discussed the outlook for inflation in the context of the past, current and, primarily, expected economic situation.",
        "The Council addressed the prospects of economic growth and their impact on inflation.",
        "Some Council members emphasised that the structure of the current economic growth is favourable to low inflation.",
        "They pointed out that the robust growth in investment and its structure, characterised by a relatively low share of construction projects, will contribute to fast growth in potential output, thus curbing inflationary pressure.",
        "Strong growth in potential output will also be facilitated by a large inflow of foreign greenfield investment supporting increase in productivity.",
        "Furthermore, some Council members indicated that the April data concerning industrial production and retail sales as well as business indicators in manufacturing, construction and retail sales might suggest a possible minor slowdown in economic growth in 2007 Q2.",
        "Other members of the Council emphasised that GDP is still rising faster than potential output, leading to a widening of the output gap and a rise in inflationary pressure.",
        "In their opinion, in the subsequent quarters the high economic growth will be sustained, primarily due to fast increase in domestic demand supported by rapid growth in the wage fund and lending activity.",
        "Those members emphasised that investment growth will boost potential output only in the longer term.",
        "They assessed that there is a considerable risk that in the medium term the GDP growth exceeding the growth of potential output will lead to a rise in inflation above the inflation target.",
        "Moreover, they argued that although the increase in imports and price competitiveness related to globalisation will limit the influence of domestic output gap on inflation, the scale of the impact of those factors might be insufficient to maintain inflation at the target level.",
        "During its meeting, the Council discussed the situation in the labour market.",
        "Council members agreed that the developments in the labour market were the main risk factor for inflation increase.",
        "However, they differed in their interpretation of the inflowing data and their assessment of the impact of the current situation in the labour market on inflation.",
        "Some Council members assessed that GUS data concerning the growth of wages in the corporate sector in April 2007 and wages in the economy as a whole in 2007 Q1 confirmed that wage growth has been accelerating.",
        "They pointed out that dynamic wage growth was observed in all major groups of enterprises.",
        "Some members of the Council signalled that strong wage growth in enterprises was accompanied by increasing wage pressure in the public sector, which is reflected in numerous industrial actions.",
        "They indicated that the rapid growth of wages was driving a considerable - and significantly higher than suggested by the NBP April projection - increase in unit labour costs in the economy.",
        "Moreover, some Council members pointed at a very fast - and higher than suggested by the April projection - decline in the unemployment rate recorded in the BAEL data, which may fuel further wage growth.",
        "Council members assessed that rapid wage growth, by raising costs and disposable income, improving consumer sentiment and increasing demand, may contribute to acceleration in price growth.",
        "Other Council members emphasised that April saw a decline in the growth rate of wages in the corporate sector.",
        "They pointed out that for a few years the share of labour costs in the costs of large and medium enterprises has been decreasing and that in 2007 Q1 the rapid wage growth was accompanied by considerable improvement in the profitability of enterprises amidst stable inflation.",
        "Those members also observed that despite a considerable fall in unemployment, it still remains relatively high, which suggests the presence of significant ‘free’ labour force in the economy.",
        "Some members of the Council noted that accelerating wage growth does not necessarily have to lead to a rise in inflation due to increase in competitive pressure driven by globalisation and a very good financial standing of enterprises allowing them to partially absorb wage increases without the need to change their goods and services prices.",
        "Furthermore, they pointed out that inflationary pressure might also be constrained by rising efficiency related to high investment growth and enterprises’ restructuring.",
        "Referring to current inflation indicators, some Council members assessed that the April decline in net inflation and in the growth rate of producer prices in industry, which accompanied the decrease in CPI inflation, might signal low inflationary pressure.",
        "However, other members of the Council noted that the April decline in net inflation was mainly the result of the statistical base effect.",
        "They also emphasised that given the growing importance of global factors in determining domestic inflation developments, an important indicator of domestic inflationary pressure is the growth rate of services prices, which has been gradually rising since mid-2006 and which now significantly exceeds the growth rate of prices of consumer goods and services.",
        "Some Council members pointed out that the increase in inflation expectations is a risk factor for inflation.",
        "They observed that in April inflation forecasts of bank analysts exceeded the level of the inflation target for the first time for more than two years.",
        "Some discussants emphasised that domestic inflation is to an increasing extent determined by global factors.",
        "They pointed out that due to high credibility of monetary policy conducted by major central banks, global inflation can be expected to remain at a low level which would be conducive to the stabilisation of domestic inflation.",
        "However, they also indicated that a possible increase in the world food prices resulting from supply factors is a new global risk factor for inflation.",
        "One of the issues discussed at the meeting was the impact of the zloty exchange rate on inflation.",
        "In this context, the influence of fundamental factors as well as trends in the international financial markets was considered.",
        "One of the issues addressed at the meeting was the situation in the public finance sector.",
        "Some Council members assessed that lower than expected general government deficit will partly offset rising demand in the private sector and mitigate its effect on inflation.",
        "Yet, other members of the Council argued that the observed improvement of the situation in public finances is a cyclical phenomenon and as such is not a factor which will limit price growth in the monetary policy transmission horizon.",
        "At its meeting the Council also discussed developments in monetary and credit aggregates.",
        "Some Council members assessed that the persistently high growth in lending will support strong increase in private consumption, and consequently, in aggregate demand and inflation.",
        "They pointed out that as a result of the pro-cyclical nature of credit growth, in the coming months a further rapid increase in household and corporate indebtedness in the banking sector can be expected.",
        "Those members also indicated that for a few months the share of consumer loans in the credit structure has been rising and that those loans might be directly translated into growing demand and inflationary pressure.",
        "Other members of the Council assessed that apart from a slight, in their opinion, change in the lending structure, the monetary and credit developments are a continuation of the hitherto observed trends and should not constitute a risk for inflation growth.",
        "During the meeting the Council also discussed the levels of real interest rates and their impact on inflation.",
        "Some Council members noted that the economic recovery observed in Poland started and has been reinforced in a situation when real interest rates were markedly higher than today.",
        "They therefore assessed that the current level of interest rates probably does not prevent widening of the output gap and rise in inflationary pressure.",
        "Moreover, those members pointed out that amidst the globalisation-related weakening of a short-term link between economic activity and inflation, the cost of a monetary policy tightening aimed at bringing inflation back to the target would be considerably higher than the cost of preventing inflation growth.",
        "However, other members of the Council pointed out that the level of real interest rates is still relatively high, especially when compared to other countries in the region.",
        "In this context, Council members exchanged their opinions concerning the future path of the NBP interest rates.",
        "At the meeting a motion to raise the key NBP interest rates by 25 basis points was put forward and rejected.",
        "The Council kept the interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 4.25%, the lombard rate at 5.75%, the deposit rate at 2.75% and the rediscount rate at 4.50%.",
        "During the meeting, the Monetary Policy Council discussed the outlook for inflation developments in the context of the past, current and, primarily, anticipated economic situation.",
        "The discussion at the meeting focused on: changes in the environment of the Polish economy, current inflation developments, the outlook for economic growth and the prospects of public finance in 2008 and in subsequent years.",
        "The Council discussed the influence of these factors on the future inflation in Poland.",
        "While discussing the changes in the environment of the Polish economy, it was pointed out that there were downward revisions of the forecasts of economic growth in the United States and the European Union and that there was a risk of a deceleration in worldwide economic growth, which may slow the growth of Polish exports and the inflow of direct investments and, consequently, reduce the rate of economic growth in Poland.",
        "Nevertheless, it was argued that in the past, in the period of low economic growth, some Western European countries had reported increased demand for relatively cheap products from Poland, which complicated the assessment of the actual impact of the world economic slowdown on Poland’s economic growth.",
        "Moreover, it was pointed out that the current GDP growth was primarily driven by rising domestic demand (i.e.",
        "Some Council members emphasised that, in the face of the deteriorating situation in international financial markets and the dampening prospect of economic growth, major central banks were expected to ease their monetary policy.",
        "Other Council members pointed out that those central banks which did not raise their interest rates or lowered them despite rising inflation are precisely the banks of the countries directly affected by the financial market turmoil.",
        "In this context, it was pointed out that the low interest rates that had been observed until recently had led to the creation of excessive global liquidity, which was not reflected in the inflation of consumer prices, but caused a significant rise in asset prices instead.",
        "For two years now, the prices in the world markets of some assets have been falling, and so it is currently hard to assess the direction in which the liquidity surplus will be moving.",
        "While discussing the economic growth in Poland in the years to come, some Council members emphasised that GDP growth should gradually decrease in the next years, which would be easing the demand pressure.",
        "Moreover, a fast growth in investments of enterprises, which is indicated by the data for the first three quarters of 2007, should be favouring the growth in potential output.",
        "Both these factors will be conducive to limiting the inflationary pressure.",
        "Other members of the Council pointed out that the October data on industrial production and retail sales did not signal a weakening of economic activity in Poland.",
        "It was emphasised that the high growth of domestic demand was supported by rapid increase of wages and very good financial results of enterprises.",
        "Moreover, those members also believed that even though the GDP growth would probably slow down in the coming years, it would remain at a relatively high level.",
        "While addressing the situation in the labour market, it was pointed out that the high wage growth led to a considerable increase in unit labour costs in the economy.",
        "It was argued that the wage growth in the economy in 2007 Q3 was higher than expected in the October projection.",
        "The continuation of the high growth of wages is also suggested by record-high data on corporate wages in October and the continuously falling rate of unemployment.",
        "Some Council members pointed out that the wage differentials between the private and the public sector may be rising, which would lead to the outflow of skilled public sector workers to private companies and thus increase the wage pressure in the public sector.",
        "Some discussants indicated that, due to the high wage growth in 2007 Q3, the rise in remuneration costs outpaced the growth of enterprises’ revenues for the first time in a long time, which may be an indication that the falling trend of the relation of labour costs to revenues had been reversed.",
        "In the opinion of other Council members, however, the rise in unit labour costs had not so far translated into rising inflationary pressure due to high profits of enterprises.",
        "Moreover, the growth of unit labour costs may be expected to go down in the monetary policy transmission horizon due to the expected acceleration in labour productivity resulting from fast growth in investments.",
        "It was also emphasised that a potential deceleration in the global economy, including Western European economies, might lead to lower emigration of Polish workers, which would limit the wage pressure.",
        "While addressing the current inflation, it was pointed out that following a long period of inflation running below the inflation target, in October the annual growth of consumer price exceeded the inflation target of 2.5%.",
        "Some Council Members emphasised that the rise in CPI inflation in October was to a large extent the result of a surge in food and fuel prices, while the core inflation net of those prices remained at a relatively low level.",
        "The same members pointed out that it was difficult to assess at the moment whether the factors responsible for inflation rise would prove permanent.",
        "Other Council members, however, pointed out that all measures of core inflation had risen since the previous month and the increase in core inflation net of food and fuel prices was significant as compared to the changes of this indicator over the past year.",
        "They believed this suggested that the inflationary pressure that had been building for some time was beginning to be reflected in the growth of prices.",
        "The Council discussed the usefulness of the indicator of core inflation net of food and fuel prices as a measure for assessing inflationary pressure.",
        "Some Council members were of the opinion that in the light of empirical studies for the United States core inflation is a good gauge of the price level trend.",
        "Other Council members, however, pointed out that the net core inflation in the United States in the past ten year had been lower on average than CPI inflation and so it failed to fully reflect the movements of consumer prices.",
        "It was also emphasised that net core inflation accounted for the supply-side globalisation effects of disinflationary nature (decline in the prices of goods imported from low production costs countries), but only to a limited degree – for the demand-side globalisation effects of inflationary nature (growing prices of energy commodities and food).",
        "While discussing future inflation, some members of the Council pointed out that the price growth in the coming quarters was already determined to some extent.",
        "Those members believed that inflation would be temporarily increased, which would primarily be the result – just like in many other countries – of increased food and fuels prices, i.e.",
        "factors beyond the control of monetary policy.",
        "Other Council members emphasised that the October inflation projection pointed to the continuation of high inflationary pressure throughout the projection horizon, among others due to the growth in domestic demand above GDP growth rate as well as wage growth outpacing the rise in labour productivity.",
        "The discussants pointed out that an increase in inflation, particularly when it is triggered by a surge in food and fuel prices, which significantly affect the perception of inflation by consumers, may lead to increased inflation expectations and thus pump up the pressure for the growth of wages.",
        "The risk of second-round effects is higher than in 2004 due to the tight labour market, including a markedly lower unemployment.",
        "On the other hand, it was argued that the current risk of secondround effects was significantly lower than at the time of oil shocks in the 1970s.",
        "At the meeting, the Council also discussed the growth of food prices in the world markets, which is currently stepping up inflation both in Poland and in the majority of other countries.",
        "Some discussants assessed that the increased growth of food prices may continue in the longer term.",
        "At the same time, it was argued that the food price increase would mean changing the relative prices and a rise in the food expenditures of households.",
        "As a result, there may be a lowered demand for other goods, which would limit the rise of the overall price level.",
        "Other Council members pointed out that the increase in food prices in international markets could be transitory and result from negative supply shocks.",
        "In the context of the food price developments, the question was raised of a possible increase of VAT rates on unprocessed food and catering services in 2008 and of its impact on inflation.",
        "The Council devoted a lot of attention to the outlook for the public finance.",
        "It was emphasised that due to the low actual state budget deficit till the end of October 2007 and, at the same time, the restated announcement that this year’s deficit would be implemented at the expected level, there was a risk of a considerable accumulation of public expenditure in the last two months of 2007, which would be conducive to raising inflationary pressure.",
        "Moreover, it was pointed out that, on the one hand, there appeared announcements of tax cuts and, on the other, the wage growth in the budget sector would be most probably higher than accounted for in the draft Budget Act for 2008.",
        "It was also emphasised that some acts passed by the previous Parliament before its dissolution could increase the public finance imbalance for many years to come.",
        "While discussing the issues related to the exchange rate, it was pointed out that since September 2007 the zloty had significantly appreciated.",
        "On the one hand, appreciation of the zloty limits the impact of high oil prices on inflation in Poland, on the other, however, it dampens the competitiveness of the Polish economy, contributing to rising external imbalance.",
        "Still, it was emphasised that the export enterprises to a large extent use imported goods in their production, which limits the negative impact of the appreciation of the zloty on their financial situation.",
        "It was also argued that the zloty appreciation was decreasing the zloty-denominated value of EU subsidies to the Polish agriculture and the value of Polish emigrants’ remittances, which is conducive to lower domestic demand.",
        "Similarly, it was indicated that at the moment it was difficult to assess the sustainability of the factors that had been conducive to the recent zloty appreciation.",
        "In conclusion of the discussion it was agreed that the sustained fast growth of demand, the tight labour market, the significant increase in current inflation and the risk of the related second-round effects, as well as the expected considerable surge in demand of the public finance sector until the end of 2008, all warranted the assessment that the probability of inflation overshooting the inflation target over the monetary policy transmission horizon was significant and this necessitated an interest rate increase at the November meeting.",
        "A motion to raise the key NBP interest rates by 25 basis points was put forward and passed.",
        "The Council raised the interest rates to the following levels: the reference rate at 5.00%, the lombard rate at 6.50%, the deposit rate at 3.50% and the rediscount rate at 5.25%.",
        "During the meeting, the Monetary Policy Council discussed the outlook for inflation developments in the context of the past, current and, primarily, anticipated economic situation.",
        "The discussion at the meeting focused on: current inflation developments, including food price changes, situation in the labour market, the outlook for economic growth and the level of interest rates in Poland and abroad.",
        "The Council discussed the influence of these factors on the future inflation in Poland.",
        "While discussing current inflation, the Council analysed the causes of the annual growth of consumer prices in November running above the NBP inflation target of 2.5% and exceeding the upper limit for deviations from the target set at 3.5%.",
        "It was pointed out that CPI growth in November was primarily driven by the accelerated growth of food and fuel prices; while net core inflation recorded just a minor rise and remained at a relatively low level.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members, low level of net core inflation indicated low inflationary pressure driven by demand.",
        "At the same time, it was emphasised that high growth of food and fuel prices and the ensuing growth in CPI inflation were related to global developments which are beyond the scope of the domestic monetary policy.",
        "In turn, some discussants, pointed out at the continuing price increases of some services and at falling disinflationary impact of declining prices of goods imported from low-cost countries.",
        "While addressing food price developments, the Council discussed the sustainability of their increased growth.",
        "Some members of the Council believed that high growth of food prices was a temporary phenomenon as it was, to a large extent, driven by supply shocks in the global markets.",
        "It was also pointed out that high prices of certain agricultural commodities might be partly related to speculation of financial institutions in the futures markets and that there had already been signals of a decline in the prices of some of commodities.",
        "Other discussants assessed that high growth of food prices may be sustained over a longer period, as it is largely determined by the persistently growing world’s demand for food, while the supply shortages on the global scale may be more frequent than before, among other things, due to climate changes.",
        "The possible impact of abandoning the Russian embargo on Polish food exports on the growth of food prices in Poland was also discussed.",
        "Some discussants assessed that the forecasted rise in net core inflation and the continuing high growth of food and fuel prices might result in CPI inflation remaining above the inflation target at the end of 2008.",
        "At the same time they emphasised that, due to the specific nature of shocks leading to price increases, CPI inflation was likely to stay above net core inflation over a longer period.",
        "It was also pointed out that considerable uncertainty persisted about the scale of the declared increases in gas and energy prices in 2008.",
        "Other members of the Council argued that future inflation might be lower than in the October projection due to higher level of zloty exchange rate than accounted for in the projection.",
        "It was pointed out that even though Poland continued to meet the Maastricht price stability criterion in November 2007 the rise in inflation might pose risk of inflation exceeding the reference value in the coming future.",
        "Some members of the Council indicated that the rise in current CPI inflation was likely to boost inflation expectations.",
        "They emphasised that the risk of rising inflation expectations is particularly high when inflation increase is driven by a strong growth in the prices of food, i.e.",
        "frequently purchased goods having high share in the CPI basket.",
        "It was pointed out that rising inflation expectations might add to wage pressure.",
        "Moreover, some discussants argued that the rise in current inflation – unlike in 2004 – took place amidst strong economic growth and tight labour market which increased the likelihood of rising inflation expectations and of the so-called second-round effects.",
        "Other Council members, however, believed that the risk of second-round effects was moderate due to institutional changes that had taken place in the labour markets in Poland and in other countries.",
        "While discussing the labour market situation, it was pointed out that wage growth in the economy in 2007 Q3 had exceeded the level accounted for in the October projection, wage growth in the corporate sector in November had been very high and the pressure on significant wage increases in the public sector persisted.",
        "It was indicated that wage growth continued to exceed labour productivity growth, which was conducive to growing inflationary pressure.",
        "Some discussants argued that high wage growth was likely to be sustained also in the months to come due to labour shortage in the domestic market, and that wages would grow faster than assumed in the October inflation projection.",
        "Those discussants assessed this would further boost unit labour costs which would, in turn, lead to worsening the financial results of enterprises and to reducing investment in the economy.",
        "In the opinion of those discussants, tensions in the labour market reflected in the plunge of unemployment rate and the rising current inflation resulted in the risk of second-round effects being higher than in 2004.",
        "They also argued that the scale of economic migration would not decrease significantly in the years to come due to persisting high differences in income levels between Poland and Western European countries.",
        "Other members of the Council argued that there might arise factors that would be curbing wage and unit labour cost growth.",
        "They believed that wage growth in the corporate sector might be restrained by concerns about deteriorating financial results of enterprises.",
        "These members pointed out that significant pay rises in the public finance sector were rather unlikely as they had not been provided for in the draft Budget Act for 2008.",
        "Attention was drawn to the fact that the growth of unit labour costs in the economy outside private farming in 2007 Q3 was lower than assumed in the October projection.",
        "It was also pointed out that the unemployment rate in Poland continued to exceed levels recorded in other countries and that tensions in the labour market might soon diminish as wage growth in Poland and zloty appreciation should reduce the scale of Polish labour migration.",
        "While discussing the outlook for economic growth in Poland, some members of the Council pointed out that GDP growth in 2007 Q3 had been higher than assumed in the October projection and that economic growth in 2007 Q4 had probably continued at a high level.",
        "It was also indicated that a continued growth in demand would be supported by the fast growth in lending.",
        "Other members of the Council pointed to the expected decline in world economic growth, which might impede the growth of Polish exports and the inflow of foreign direct investment and, as a result, weaken the economic growth of Poland.",
        "Moreover, some members of the Council argued that despite high GDP and wage growth the structure of GDP did not suggest increased demand pressure: growth in total consumption, private consumption and imports in 2007 Q3 were slower than assumed in the projection, whereas exports were rising faster.",
        "It was emphasised that stronger than projected investment growth in 2007 Q3 suggested the possibility of faster growth in potential output and weakening inflationary pressure in the medium term.",
        "The Council paid a lot of attention to assessing the monetary policy conditions in Poland.",
        "Some members of the Council pointed out that NBP interest rate increases in 2007 combined with the appreciation of zloty exchange rate contributed to maintaining high level of monetary policy restrictiveness.",
        "Those members also indicated that the level of the real interest rate in Poland was relatively high as compared to other countries of the region.",
        "Other discussants pointed out that the level of the real interest rate had fallen in 2007 as a result of CPI inflation rising stronger than the nominal interest rates.",
        "They argued that the differences in the level of real interest rates between countries resulted, among other things, from the differences in the level of their natural interest rate.",
        "Those discussants also pointed out that the assessment of changes in the level of monetary policy restrictiveness should take into account the appreciation of the equilibrium exchange rate related to the convergence process.",
        "They also indicated that it was difficult to assess the sustainability of factors behind the recent appreciation of the zloty.",
        "Some members of the Council argued that certain central banks had decided to lower their interest rates in the recent period.",
        "Other members, however, pointed out that interest rate cuts had taken place mainly in countries directly affected by the financial market turmoil and that some banks had tightened their monetary policy at that time.",
        "The majority of the Council members argued that high level of current inflation and the ensuing risk of rising inflation expectations, as well as tight labour market, constituted a major risk to price stability.",
        "Some members of the Council believed that counteracting inflation risk within the monetary policy horizon would require interest rates to be raised at the Council meeting in December.",
        "Those members argued that globalisation processes in the past few years had led to weakening the impact of monetary policy on domestic inflation, thus requiring stronger response of central banks to the growing inflationary pressure.",
        "They assessed that rises of interest rates should not lead to any significant slowdown of economic growth in Poland, yet it would help to stabilise it at a level consistent with the potential growth.",
        "Other members of the Council pointed out that it was difficult to assess inflationary inertia.",
        "They also argued that a monetary policy tightening would increase interest rate disparity between Poland and the euro area and the United States.",
        "This could encourage the inflow of short-term capital to Poland and contribute to the appreciation of zloty exchange rate, which would, in turn, weaken the competitiveness of the Polish economy and led to further increase of external imbalance.",
        "Moreover, those members pointed out that the pace of monetary policy tightening so far was sufficient from the point of view of stabilising inflation at the target level in the medium term.",
        "It was indicated that at its December meeting the Council had at its disposal less information on economic developments than usual and that a more comprehensive assessment of the risk of inflation remaining at a high level would be possible at the Council’s next meeting.",
        "A motion to raise the key NBP interest rates by 25 basis points was put forward.",
        "The motion did not pass.",
        "The Council kept the interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 5.00%, the lombard rate at 6.50%, the deposit rate at 3.50% and the rediscount rate at 5.25%.",
        "During the meeting, the Monetary Policy Council discussed the outlook for inflation in the context of the past, current and, primarily, anticipated economic situation.",
        "The discussion at the meeting focused on: changes in the environment of the Polish economy, exchange rate and food prices developments and the outlook for economic growth.",
        "The Council discussed the influence of these factors on the future inflation in Poland in view of the October inflation projection.",
        "While discussing the changes in the environment of the Polish economy, it was pointed out that considerable uncertainty persisted as to the assessment what effects the turmoil in international financial markets would have on the outlook for growth and inflation in the global and Polish economies.",
        "It was emphasised that there had been a downward revision of the forecast of economic growth in the United States and, to a lesser degree, in the euro area, and that the sentiment of euroarea consumers and producers was less optimistic.",
        "It was pointed out that in the past, in the period of low economic growth, Western European countries had reported increased demand for relatively cheap products from Poland.",
        "However, the recently observed appreciation of the zloty might result in a decrease of exports due to the deteriorated competitiveness of Polish products.",
        "As a consequence, economic slowdown of Poland’s main trade partners would translate into a weakened economic activity in Poland.",
        "It was also pointed out that in the face of turmoil in international financial markets some central banks decided to ease or restrain further monetary policy tightening despite mounting inflationary pressure.",
        "Some Council members argued that the impact of the disruptions in the US real estate market on economic growth may prove weaker than expected, due to the continuously stable net value of the assets held by US households.",
        "Moreover, the discussants pointed out that the situation in international financial markets had stabilised to some extent.",
        "It was emphasised that, despite persistent uncertainty as to the impact of turmoil on global economic growth, some central banks had raised interest rates over the recent period, which was related to rising inflationary pressure observed in those economies.",
        "It was also argued that one of the factors that contributed to the recently observed turmoil in international financial markets, was lax monetary policy previously pursued by major central banks.",
        "The members of the Council devoted a lot of attention to the zloty exchange rate.",
        "In this context, the influence of fundamental factors as well as tendencies in the international financial markets were considered.",
        "Some Council members also pointed to the possible impact of the parliamentary election outcome in Poland on exchange rate developments.",
        "It was emphasised that the zloty had appreciated since the previous meeting of the Council.",
        "Some Council members argued that the zloty appreciation would limit price growth.",
        "Those members pointed out that in Poland, just like in other small open economies, foreign exchange movements are an important factor influencing economic situation and inflation.",
        "Other Council members, however, indicated that, at the moment, it was difficult to assess the sustainability of the factors that had been conducive to zloty appreciation.",
        "While commenting on the current inflation, some Council members pointed out that the average 12month HICP for Poland, which is considered in the assessment of the compliance with the inflation Maastricht criterion, had been steadily rising since the end of 2006.",
        "At the same time, it was argued that there was a considerable risk that in the next few quarters Poland might cease to comply with the Maastricht inflation criterion.",
        "Other members emphasised that net inflation continued at a low and stable level and that the rise in CPI inflation in September 2007 resulted primarily from a rise in food prices, which was independent from the monetary policy.",
        "At the meeting, the Council also discussed food price developments.",
        "Growth of these prices may continue in the longer term as it stems, to a large extent, from structural factors connected with increased demand for food in developing countries.",
        "At the same time it was pointed out that in Poland food still accounted for a considerable part of the consumption basket of households.",
        "As a result, a significant price increase in this group of products may be conducive to increasing inflation expectations and, consequently, to further build-up of wage pressure.",
        "Some Council members, however, claimed that the risk of second-round effects connected with food price growth was not high, as further acceleration of wage growth was rather unlikely considering the appearing symptoms of weakening economic growth.",
        "While discussing the influence of global factors on the inflation outlook, some Council members concluded that inflation was still being curbed by a decline in prices of goods imported from countries of low production costs.",
        "However, an ever increasing pressure on growth of prices should be expected due to rising demand of those countries, which is already visible in the food and commodity markets.",
        "This means that the impact of globalisation factors on inflation may be reverted.",
        "Other members pointed out that in the face of rising demand an increase in food output might occur, which would mitigate the pressure on price growth.",
        "The same members indicated that, at the moment, it was difficult to assess the joint effect of globalisation factors on future inflation.",
        "The members of the Council also discussed labour market developments.",
        "Some Council members pointed out that the currently observed fast wage growth was connected with permanent factors such as the shortage of qualified workers and the ongoing process of Polish wages converging to the level of more developed EU countries.",
        "It was emphasised that the wage pressure may be additionally increased by possible second-round effects connected with the rising food prices.",
        "Discussants underlined that wage growth was still being fuelled by increased emigration of Polish workforce to EU countries.",
        "In turn, some Council members assessed that, most likely, the main emigration wave had already passed and that enterprises were beginning to adjust to labour market developments.",
        "The same members argued that the results of survey studies of enterprises indicated that a relatively small group of enterprises intended to raise wages, while in September 2007 the wage growth in the enterprise sector had recorded some deceleration.",
        "It was also emphasised that wage growth exceeding the rise in labour productivity would be limited in time, as the decelerating growth of the output and sales of enterprises would limit the possibility of pay rises.",
        "Additionally, it was argued that the growth of unit labour costs in the economy calculated on the basis of BAEL (LFS) data may be overestimated.",
        "While discussing the issue of economic growth in Poland, it was noticed that in October 2007 GUS data on GDP growth in the first half of 2007 had been revised downwards.",
        "Moreover, it was emphasised that the macroeconomic data for September 2007 suggested a slowdown in economic growth (there was a decline in the growth of industrial production, retail sales and wages in the enterprise sector and also in money supply and loans to households).",
        "Nevertheless, some Council members argued that the latest data did not indicate the substantial economic slowdown which would reduce inflationary pressure, as there had not been any significant change of trends of those macroeconomic variables.",
        "Moreover, it was noticed that the lowering of economic growth had been anticipated and was accounted for in the October inflation projection.",
        "The Council also discussed the outlook for inflation as outlined in the inflation projection based on the ECMOD model.",
        "Some members of the Council pointed out that, in line with the central projection, in 2009, CPI inflation and core net inflation will breach the upper limit for deviations from the inflation target.",
        "They also emphasised that the projection did not fully cover the risk of inflation overshooting the target.",
        "It was argued that the forecasted lowering of wage growth was rather unlikely amid continuing surge in demand and decreasing rate of unemployment, which, in their assessments, was running below the NAWRU.",
        "At the same time, those members pointed out that, due to the procyclicality of labour productivity, it was hard to expect it to accelerate amid the forecasted lowering of GDP growth.",
        "In consequence, they argued, the growth of unit labour costs may prove higher than forecast in the projection.",
        "It was also pointed out that the projection forecast a considerable acceleration of potential GDP growth, which was faster than suggested by experiences of other countries.",
        "Moreover, it was emphasised that the projection did not fully account for the risk of a permanent rise of food price dynamics and the risk of second-round effects.",
        "Other Council members, on the other hand, pointed out that the level of the zloty exchange rate accounted for at the starting point of the projection was weaker than that observed; at the same time a nominal exchange rate depreciation was forecasted in the projection horizon.",
        "It was argued that if the exchange rate of the zloty sustained at an unchanged level, inflation might be significantly lower than in the projection.",
        "While addressing the situation of the public finance, some Council members emphasised the fact that the state budget deficit in 2007 should be considerably lower than envisaged and at the same time, its ratio to GDP would decreased in relation to the previous year.",
        "It was pointed out that in 2008 the ratio of the deficit to GDP should not increase and might even decrease.",
        "Some discussants, however, claimed that 2008 would bring a rise in the structural deficit of the public finance sector, which meant that the fiscal policy would have a procyclical impact on the economy.",
        "As a result of the discussion some members concluded that the assessment of the inflation outlook based of the ECMOD-based October inflation projection and considering factors not accounted for in the projection indicated that the probability of inflation overshooting the target in the projection horizon was significant and warrant raising interest rates at the October meeting.",
        "Other Council members, however, were convinced that the recently observed appreciation of the zloty exchange rate limited the rise of inflation and that the inflation outlook would be affected by future developments in the foreign exchange market.",
        "They also pointed to the symptoms of an economic weakening.",
        "A motion to raise the key NBP interest rates by 25 percentage points was put forward at the meeting.",
        "The motion did not pass.",
        "The Council kept the interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 4.75%, the lombard rate at 6.25%, the deposit rate at 3.25% and the rediscount rate at 5.00%.",
        "During the meeting the Monetary Policy Council discussed the outlook for inflation in the context of the past, current and, primarily, expected economic situation.",
        "The Council paid considerable attention to the prospects of economic growth.",
        "Council members pointed out that the Polish economy is in the stage of strong economic growth and that the high GDP growth may be expected to be sustained in the medium term, at least.",
        "The factors supporting robust economic growth should be the inflow of foreign direct investment and EU funds, as well as optimistic expectations of enterprises regarding future economic situation, additionally boosted by the prospect of Poland hosting the European Football Championships in 2012.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members, high economic growth in the coming years will be favoured by strong economic growth in EU countries.",
        "Most Council members considered the current GDP growth to be higher than the potential output growth.",
        "However, the Council members differed in their assessment of the magnitude of the impact this factor may have on inflationary pressure.",
        "Some members of the Council believed that there is a significant risk that a demand growth exceeding the growth of potential GDP would lead to a rise in costs and, consequently, to higher inflation and widening external imbalance.",
        "They pointed out that, in the medium term, inflation running above the inflation target would result in Polish economy gradually losing its price competitiveness.",
        "Other members of the Council emphasised that the structure of the current economic growth is favourable for low inflation, as over the past several quarters the contribution of investment to GDP growth has been rising, which should be conducive to increasing the potential output and limiting inflationary pressure.",
        "Moreover, they assessed that the high GDP growth in 2007 Q1 was to some extent the result of favourable weather conditions, which most strongly affected the construction output.",
        "The disappearance of these one-off factors in the next quarters, they argued, may reduce the risk of inflation increase.",
        "Another issue discussed at the meeting was the impact of the European Football Championships, which is to be co-hosted by Poland in 2012, on the outlook for economic growth and inflation.",
        "Council members assessed that the organisation of the championships should help sustain the high rate of economic growth in the years to come.",
        "Some discussants pointed out that the rise in potential output related to hosting the event will be lower than demand growth and also that it will be delayed in time, which should lead to inflation increase.",
        "Furthermore, the discussants argued that the investment connected with the championships will be to a large extent financed with public funds, thus creating the risk of a further deepening of the public finance imbalance.",
        "The Council paid significant attention to the situation in the labour market and its impact on inflation outlook.",
        "In the opinion of the majority of Council members, a significant risk factor of inflation growth is the currently observed acceleration in wage growth in the corporate sector.",
        "They emphasised that the following factors will contribute to wage growth acceleration: significant decline in unemployment, structural mismatch in the labour market and the emigration of Polish workers to other EU countries, as well as wage convergence between Poland and EU countries.",
        "They also argued that the currently observed fast economic growth is strengthening employees’ expectations for wage growth acceleration.",
        "Some Council members pointed out that it remained uncertain to what extent the recently observed wage growth acceleration in enterprises was the result of permanent tendencies and to what extent it was fuelled by one-off factors and, therefore, should be seen as a temporary development.",
        "Thus, they were convinced that a more comprehensive assessment of the scale of wage pressure strengthening will only be possible after more labour market data are released.",
        "These Council members assessed that the rise of unit labour costs will still be constrained by a dynamic increase in investment outlays in the enterprise sector, which should be conducive to sustaining high growth of productivity in this sector.",
        "It should also be supported by the structure of employment changing towards a greater share of young workers with relatively higher productivity, yet also higher wage expectations, in relation to the persons who retire.",
        "Some discussants pointed out that the wage growth will still be curbed by globalisation processes and the ensuing increase in international competition.",
        "They argued that the wage growth acceleration does not necessarily have to lead to inflation growth due to the very good financial standing of enterprises which makes it possible for them to partially absorb wage increases without the need to raise their prices.",
        "Moreover, some Council members emphasised that the rising growth of wages may be partially related to acceleration in the process of Polish wages converging to those in other EU countries, which should be taken into account in monetary policy.",
        "The members of the Council also discussed the impact of the zloty exchange rate on inflation.",
        "In this context, some Council members tended to pay more attention to fundamental factors, including the inflow of foreign direct investments and EU funds, while others put greater emphasis on developments in the international financial markets.",
        "During the meeting, the Council also addressed the April projection of inflation and GDP presented by NBP analysts and based on the ECMOD model.",
        "The projection is one of the inputs to the decision-making process on NBP interest rates.",
        "The April projection indicates that, assuming constant interest rates, there will be a gradual inflation increase in the monetary policy transmission horizon.",
        "According to the central projection path, inflation, after a temporary fall in 2007 Q3, will gradually rise and, in the second half of 2009, it will approach the upper limit for deviations from the inflation target.",
        "The discussion revealed three different assessments of the April projection.",
        "Some Council members accepted the inflation outlook outlined in the April projection as probable.",
        "Other discussants, however, assessed that inflation may prove higher than that indicated by the projection, due to the projection’s possible underestimation of wage and GDP growth.",
        "Finally, other members of the Council pointed out that, in line with the April projection based on the ECMOD model and other forecasts prepared at the NBP, in the short term inflation will be running clearly below the inflation target, while in the longer term it will be lower than it is outlined in the projection.",
        "Most Council members were of the opinion that it is necessary to tighten monetary policy, yet there were different views on the right timing of the interest rates increase.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members, the assessment of the balance of risks for future inflation did not provide clear grounds for tightening the monetary policy at the present meeting.",
        "They pointed to the uncertainty as to the duration and scale of wage growth acceleration.",
        "They also underlined that inflation expectations have remained low, not creating risk for inflation growth.",
        "They also indicated that the recently observed acceleration in CPI inflation was primarily the result of supply-side and statistical factors.",
        "At the same time, they argued, core inflation has remained low.",
        "Additionally, they highlighted that, according to the majority of forecasts, in the short term inflation will be most probably running below the inflation target.",
        "Raising the interest rates, they maintained, may boost expectations of their further increases.",
        "Moreover, a monetary policy tightening may, in their opinion, lead to lowering economic growth and, thus, the decision to raise the interest rates should only be taken when more evident risks to achieving the inflation target arise.",
        "The majority of Council members assessed that in order to keep inflation close to the target in the medium term, it is necessary to tighten the monetary policy at the present meeting.",
        "These members believed that increasing the interest rates would send a signal that monetary authorities are committed to achieve the inflation target, which would strengthen the credibility of the pursued monetary policy, lead to the stabilisation of inflation expectations and ease the pressure on wage growth.",
        "These members also assessed that a slight monetary policy tightening should have only slight, if any, impact on economic growth.",
        "They pointed out that postponing the decision to raise the interest rates may contribute to rising macroeconomic imbalances and inflation.",
        "In such a situation, the cost of a monetary policy tightening aimed at bringing inflation back to the target would be significantly higher than the cost of preventing inflation growth by a pre-emptive adjustment of monetary policy parameters, especially amid the globalisation-related weakening of a short-term link between output gap and inflation.",
        "At the meeting, a motion to raise the key NBP interest rates by 25 basis points was put forward and passed.",
        "The Council raised the interest rates to the following levels: the reference rate 4.25%, the lombard rate 5.75%, the deposit rate 2.75%, the rediscount rate 4.50%.",
        "The Council discussed the appropriate way in which this decision should be communicated to the public."

    "2009": [
        "During the meeting the Monetary Policy Council discussed the outlook for inflation in the context of the past, current and, primarily, anticipated economic situation.",
        "The discussion at the meeting focused on the zloty exchange rate developments, the outlook for economic growth in Poland and abroad and credit market conditions.",
        "The Council discussed the influence of those factors on the future inflation developments in Poland in view of the February projection of inflation and GDP.",
        "The Council paid a lot of attention to exchange rate developments.",
        "It was pointed out that the currencies of Central and Eastern Europe, including the zloty, had weakened significantly since the previous meeting of the Council.",
        "It was emphasized that the depreciation of those currencies was triggered, inter alia, by the deteriorating economic outlook for the countries of the region, including concerns over macroeconomic stability of some of those countries.",
        "An increase in the global aversion to risk, resulting in capital outflow from the emerging markets, fears of financing large trade deficits in some countries, and foreign exchange transactions by short-term investors were also considered as factors conducive to the depreciation of the currencies of the region, including the zloty.",
        "It was pointed out that the scale of zloty depreciation resulting from a relatively larger liquidity of the Polish foreign exchange market did not reflect the comparatively favourable condition and outlook for economic growth in Poland.",
        "Some Council members pointed out that the zloty depreciation might have been additionally strengthened by demand for foreign currency of Polish enterprises engaged in option contracts.",
        "The Council also discussed the impact of changes in the NBP interest rates on the zloty exchange rate developments.",
        "Some members of the Council argued that in a period of high exchange rate volatility a considerable interest rates reduction may increase the risk of further depreciation of the exchange rate.",
        "Other Council members emphasized that the impact of the interest rate disparity on the zloty exchange rate had recently been limited.",
        "They pointed out that the economic outlook for Poland constitutes the factor influencing the zloty exchange rate developments.",
        "According to those members of the Council, easing the monetary policy will counter the excessive deterioration of economic growth and, therefore, it may be a factor conducive to strengthening of the zloty exchange rate in the medium term.",
        "While analyzing the impact of the zloty depreciation on the economy, it was pointed out that the weakening of the exchange rate contributes to reducing the domestic demand by increasing households’ and enterprises’ expenditure on servicing financial obligations denominated in foreign currencies.",
        "On the other hand, it was pointed out that the zloty depreciation improves the competitiveness of Polish exports, and, contributing to the rise in prices of imported goods, is conducive to the increase in competitiveness of Polish producers in the domestic market.",
        "It was also indicated that the zloty exchange rate depreciation leads to a rise in the zloty value of EU funds.",
        "While discussing the impact of the zloty depreciation on the credit market situation, some Council members indicated that as a result of the weakening of the Polish currency the zloty value of bank assets denominated in foreign currencies increases.",
        "Without raising the capital it may lead to a  Warszawa ulica Świętokrzyska telefon (22)  55  (22)  51 decrease in banks’ capital adequacy ratios and, in consequence, may be conducive to further reduction of lending.",
        "While analyzing the impact of the zloty depreciation on the budget deficit and public debt, the Council members indicated that the exchange rate depreciation increases public spending on contributions to the European Union budget and on servicing the foreign debt.",
        "Some members of the Council assessed that a significant zloty depreciation may limit the foreign investors willingness to finance the borrowing needs of the state budget.",
        "Additionally, some Council members pointed out that further depreciation of the exchange rate may cause long-term investors, holding debt instruments issued by the Polish government, to hedge against the foreign exchange risk by making transactions in the forward market, which may strengthen the zloty depreciation as a result of arbitrage between the spot and the forward market.",
        "Other Council members, however, pointed to a relatively small share of foreign debt in the total debt of the general government sector and the dominant share of domestic investors in financing the borrowing requirements of the state.",
        "According to those Council members an increase in the borrowing needs of the governments of the developed countries resulting from undertaken counter-crisis measures is a more important factor than the zloty depreciation in limiting the possibility of external financing of the budget deficit and public debt in Poland, as well as in other developing countries.",
        "While addressing the situation in the external environment of the Polish economy, the deepening recession in developed economies (the United States, the euro zone, Japan) and the increasing slowdown in economic growth in developing countries was noted.",
        "It was argued that the worsening outlook for economic growth in China may put the expected improvement in global economic performance at risk.",
        "It was also indicated that some of the central banks had continued to ease their monetary policy in the recent period.",
        "Some members of the Council pointed out, however, to a change in monetary policy stance of the central banks of Central and Eastern Europe, which was due to the recent depreciation of their currencies.",
        "While discussing the outlook for domestic economic growth, it was pointed out that the decrease in industrial output and orders in January 2009, as well as worsening indicators of economic climate confirm that the activity in the Polish economy is deteriorating further.",
        "Moreover, it was noted that reduced lending by banks, increase in the burden for economic agents due to the previously incurred foreign-currency-denominated liabilities as well as increases in administered prices limiting the purchasing power of households will be conducive to decreasing domestic demand.",
        "The negative influence of a significant deterioration of economic outlook on corporate investment was also noted.",
        "It was indicated that further decrease in demand for Polish exports, which is connected with the deepening recession experienced by Poland’s major trade partners, will contribute to a further deterioration of economic growth in Poland.",
        "The impact of the decrease in foreign demand for Polish exports may be cushioned by the depreciation of the zloty exchange rate.",
        "Some Council members assessed that the scale of the economic slowdown in Poland may be larger than forecasted in the February NECMOD projection.",
        "The meeting also addressed the influence of the NBP interest rates reductions on domestic demand and on the situation in the banking sector as well as in the credit market.",
        "It was indicated that interest rate cuts ease the burden of servicing zloty-denominated loans of economic agents, which limits the risk of debts being unsettled by these agents, and, in consequence, acts towards increasing the stability of the financial system.",
        "It was also emphasized that lowering the interest rates leads to an increase in purchasing power of the these agents, which may contribute to an increase in domestic demand.",
        "Some Council members pointed, however, to the uncertainty surrounding the impact of lower interest rates on the domestic demand in the context of the credit market distortions.",
        "They indicated that the NBP interest rate cuts made in November and December 2008 – despite a significant drop in the 3M WIBOR rate – were accompanied by a smaller decrease in interest on corporate loans, only a slight decrease in interest on housing loans and a small increase in interest on consumer loans.",
        "Those Council member argued that the reductions of the NBP interest rates decrease the banks’ incomes from servicing the previously granted loans, which – coupled with a relatively high interest rate on deposits – may induce banks to increase margins on newly granted loans.",
        "According to some Council members, too low competition in the Polish banking sector may be a factor limiting the influence of the reductions of the NBP interest rates on the interest on loans.",
        "Some members of the Council indicated that limited demand for loans from economic agents related to negative outlook for economic growth may constitute a barrier to the credit growth.",
        "They emphasized that the decrease in creditworthiness of economic agents related to the drop in value of their assets and the increase in the burden due to the incurred foreign-currency-denominated loans may also be a factor limiting the credit growth.",
        "The Council discussed the possibility of modifying the employed monetary policy instruments in order to improve the liquidity situation in the banking sector and prevent extensive reduction of banks’ lending, including the potential extension of maturity of repo transactions, lowering the reserve requirement rate and reducing the deposit rate to a greater extent than other NBP interest rates.",
        "The Council also debated on the issues connected with employing the instruments directly influencing the zloty exchange rate in the context of developments in the foreign exchange market.",
        "While addressing the outlook for inflation, some Council members estimated that in the nearest future CPI and core inflation will remain at elevated levels, which also is indicated by the February NECMOD inflation projection.",
        "Those members argued that substantial rise in administered price and current strong depreciation of the zloty exchange rate will be conducive to increasing inflation.",
        "Other members pointed out that the February NECMOD inflation projection points to an increase of the negative output gap leading to a considerable drop in the inflationary pressure in the monetary policy transmission horizon.",
        "Those members also pointed to a decreasing wage pressure in the Polish economy.",
        "According to those Council members, the risk of permanent overshooting the inflation target due to the zloty depreciation is small in the conditions of significantly weakening demand.",
        "Those members assessed that – despite a strong depreciation of the zloty exchange rate – the core inflation in 2009 Q1 may be lower than forecasted in the February inflation and GDP projection.",
        "Moreover, they pointed out that in February 2009 the inflation expectations of households and bank analysts declined.",
        "At the meeting, the uncertainty related to inflation developments in the nearest period resulting from accounting for the changes in the consumption basket of households by GUS was also brought up.",
        "The Council also discussed the prospects of fulfilling the Maastricht price stability criterion by Poland.",
        "Some Council members indicated that due to a more rapid drop in current headline inflation in most European Union countries than in the Polish economy, in the nearest future the 12-month moving average HICP inflation in Poland, taken into account when assessing the compliance with the price stability criterion, may still exceed the reference value.",
        "Other Council member pointed out, however, that according to the February inflation and GDP projection in the NECMOD model it may be expected that the CPI inflation will decrease to a low level over the monetary policy transmission horizon, and, thus, Poland will be complying with the price stability criterion in the medium term.",
        "While analyzing the influence of fiscal policy on the economy, some Council members pointed out that the scale of reductions of public spending in 2009 announced by the government is larger than assumed in the February inflation and GDP projection.",
        "Those members indicated that the change in the way of financing some infrastructural expenditure, which shifts the expenses incurred for this purpose by the central budget to other units of the general government sector, may – should difficulties with acquiring sufficient funds on the market arise – lead to the refrainment from a part of these expenditures.",
        "They also emphasized that a more severe economic slowdown than the one currently expected by the government, and consequently lower-than-expected budget revenues, may lead to further curbing of budget expenditures.",
        "Those Council members argued that a restrictive fiscal policy supports further monetary policy easing.",
        "Other Council members, however, pointed to the actions announced by the government aimed at alleviating the effects of the crisis, including, inter alia, mortgage-loan-repayment aid for the unemployed, which will limit the restrictiveness of the fiscal policy.",
        "While considering the decision on interest rates, some Council members argued that the quickly deteriorating economic situation in the world and in Poland, the drop in inflation below the target over the projection horizon expected in the February inflation and GDP projection, and the relatively high restrictiveness of fiscal policy are factors supporting additional considerable NBP interest-rate cuts.",
        "Those members assessed that in the current conditions the influence of the interest rate disparity on the zloty exchange rate, and, by the same token, the risk of further depreciation of the zloty exchange rate, is limited.",
        "Other Council members argued that the risk of further significant depreciation of the zloty exchange rate that may lead to a considerable deterioration of economic activity in Poland, and the uncertainty about the magnitude of the impact of interest-rate cuts on domestic demand justified the decision of keeping interest rates unchanged at the current meeting.",
        "According to the majority of the Council members, given the considerable depreciation of the zloty the scale of the reduction of the NBP interest rates at the February Council meeting should be moderate.",
        "Motions to lower the NBP interest rates by 25 and 50 basis points were put forward.",
        "A motion to lower the NBP interest rates by 50 basis points did not pass.",
        "A motion to lower the interest rates by 25 basis points was passed.",
        "The Council decided to lower the NBP interest rates to the level: the reference rate to 4.00%, the lombard rate to 5.50%, the deposit rate to 2.50% and the rediscount rate to 4.25%.",
        "The Monetary Policy Council judged also that the situation on the foreign exchange market may justify employing the instruments directly affecting the zloty exchange rate.",
        "During the meeting the Monetary Policy Council discussed the outlook for future economic growth and inflation in Poland, the monetary policy conducted by the Monetary Policy Council in its second term of office, and determinants of monetary policy in subsequent years.",
        "While discussing the outlook for global economic growth, some members of the Council assessed the scale and sustainability of global economic revival as largely uncertain.",
        "Those members emphasised that improved activity to-date in the largest developed economies had been, to a large extent, the effect of fiscal stimulus packages.",
        "Those members also pointed out that, in line with economic growth outlook for 2010, strong GDP growth could be expected in Asian and Latin American economies as well as further improvement in economic activity in the United States with relatively lower GDP growth in European economies.",
        "As regards the situation in the Polish economy, it was emphasised that the in-coming data, including data on export, industrial output and construction and assembly production, as well as economic situation indices illustrating enterprises’ and households’ sentiment confirmed the gradual recovery.",
        "However, some of the members pointed to risk factors underlying a prompt and sustained revival of the Polish economy.",
        "In particular, those members pointed to reduced lending to enterprises and a decline in loan growth to households, as well as to the persistence of an unfavourable situation in the interbank market, reflected in elevated spreads between the NBP reference rate and WIBOR rates.",
        "Those members also drew attention to the quick buildup of public debt and argued that its high level could adversely affect economic growth in the medium term.",
        "While discussing current and future inflation the Council members pointed to the decrease in core inflation net of food and energy prices from 2.9% in October to 2.8% in November 2009.",
        "Some of the members were of the opinion, however, that core inflation stood at a relatively high level, which, given a likely improvement in global economic situation that potentially could trigger a rise in world prices for agricultural and energy commodities, posed a risk to maintaining inflation at the target in the medium term.",
        "However, other members maintained that given the persistence of the negative output gap in the Polish economy, a fall of inflation could be expected in subsequent quarters.",
        "Moreover, some members of the Council stressed that the risk of increased inflationary pressure in the Polish economy in the near future would be additionally contained by the still unfavourable situation in the labour market, despite some signals of improvement in recent months.",
        "While discussing the effects of the monetary policy conducted by the Council in its second term of office, some members argued that the elevated CPI inflation in the years 2008-2009 indicated that in the earlier period the level of interest rates may not have fully accounted for future inflation risk.",
        "According to those members their view was supported by the persistence of relatively high core inflation in recent quarters, including the fast growth of market services prices.",
        "In their opinion, the key factors conducive to lower inflationary pressure in 2008-2009 and thus contributing to limiting inflation’s deviation from the inflation target were the appreciation of the zloty in the period  Warszawa Świętokrzy ska  no (22)  51 preceding the outbreak of the global financial crisis and the crisis-related decline of prices of agricultural and energy commodities in global markets.",
        "Other members pointed to the fact that elevated inflation in recent years was mainly connected with factors beyond the direct control of domestic monetary policy.",
        "Those members argued that the strong rise in prices of agricultural and energy commodities in global markets at the end of 2007 and in the first half of 2008, which led to a rise in inflation in a number of countries, including Poland, was, among other things, connected with a quick increase in demand from emerging economies and legislative changes in the United States which excluded trade in commodity futures from the supervision of public institutions.",
        "They also stressed that the crisis-driven zloty depreciation which significantly exceeded the depreciation of the equilibrium exchange rate was conducive to the rise in inflation in Poland in 2009.",
        "Among the factors that had significantly influenced prices in the Polish economy, including their faster growth in recent years, the members indicated price liberalisation in certain domestic markets and increases of indirect taxes and administered prices.",
        "Those members also stressed that in that period there had been a very quick increase in loans in the Polish economy, which was connected with a strong inflow of capital to emerging markets.",
        "It was stressed that the rise in the prices of services, which contributed to increasing inflation in Poland in 2008-2009, had probably been connected with changes in the structure of private consumption and was characteristic of countries undergoing the process of convergence.",
        "When discussing the monetary policy conducted in the years 2004-2009, the members pointed out that one of the factors confirming the effectiveness of the policy was the fact that it had anchored inflation expectations at a low level.",
        "Some of the members also argued that given the lags between changes in NBP interest rates and their strongest impact on economic processes a comprehensive assessment of the monetary policy conducted by the MPC in its second term of office should account for inflation developments in 2010-2011.",
        "In this context the members of the Council pointed out that most forecasts available show a strong fall of inflation in 2010.",
        "They also argued that attempting to fully neutralise the impact of price shocks in global commodity markets on inflation in Poland would have led to excessive GDP fluctuations in Poland, including a likely GDP decrease after the outbreak of the global economic crisis.",
        "While discussing the effects of the monetary policy conducted by the Council in its second term of office against the background of other countries, some MPC members pointed to the fact that in the years 2004-2009, in addition to shocks that impacted the world economy as a whole, such as commodity shocks and the global economic crisis, the Polish economy also underwent large changes connected with the accession to the European Union.",
        "Those members pointed to the fact that despite these shocks, inflation’s average deviation from the target (0.3 p.p.",
        "), the volatility of the output gap and of central bank interest rates in Poland in 2004-2009 were among the smallest in countries which pursued inflation targeting with a continuous inflation target.",
        "While discussing the monetary policy in the coming years, some members of the Council argued that an excessive rise in lending, in particular a rise in the market for mortgage loans, could pose a threat to price stability in the Polish economy over a longer time horizon.",
        "In addition, those members stressed that if the credit boom risk increased significantly, monetary policy would have to be tightened in Poland regardless of the relatively low CPI inflation.",
        "Since interest rate rises themselves would not eliminate the credit boom risk they should be complemented with appropriate supervisory measures.",
        "While referring to the decisions on interest rates in the coming months the Council pointed out that in view of the low inflation pressure and the persisting threats to the sustainability of economic recovery in Poland, NBP interest rates should be left at an unchanged level in the near future.",
        "At the same time it was emphasised that in case of a significant economic revival in Poland, accompanied by a significant increase in inflationary pressure, a change to the monetary policy parameters could be required.",
        "Too strong and premature a monetary policy tightening in a situation of over-liquidity in global financial markets could, however, result in an excessive appreciation of the zloty.",
        "The situation of public finances will be an important conditioning factor to monetary policy.",
        "The Council concluded that leaving the interest rates unchanged was justified by the information about the Polish and global economic situation that had been released since the previous meeting.",
        "The Council left the interest rates at an unchanged level: reference rate at 3.50%, lombard rate at 5.00%, deposit rate at 2.00% and rediscount rate at 3.75%.",
        "At the same time, the Council decided to introduce, starting on 1 January 2010, the discount rate on bills of exchange accepted from commercial banks for discount at the NBP.",
        "The Council set the discount rate at 4.00% on an annual basis.",
        "During the meeting the Monetary Policy Council discussed the outlook for future inflation developments in the context of the past, current and, primarily, anticipated economic situation.",
        "The discussion at the meeting focused on the outlook for economic growth in the world and in the Polish economy, on current inflationary processes in Poland and the situation in the credit market.",
        "The Council discussed the influence of these factors on future inflation in Poland against the background of the October projection of inflation and GDP.",
        "While assessing the global economic situation, some members of the Council emphasised that the improvement in economic climate in the euro-area economy was relatively small and the forecast economic growth in the region remained considerably below potential.",
        "Those members also pointed out that the improved economic climate in the United States and in China was to a large extent rooted in the stimulus packages, and that the prospective gradual removal of such measures kept up the uncertainty about the sustainability of global economic recovery.",
        "In particular, those members stressed the uncertainty surrounding private consumption recovery in the United States amid the still deteriorating situation in the US labour market.",
        "Moreover, some Council members assessed that the drop in private consumption in the United States connected, among others, with households’ limited possibilities of taking out loans, including mortgage loans incurred to finance consumption, will not be offset by a rise in household consumption in emerging countries, even if the revived growth in these economies was sustained.",
        "In this context, those members pointed to the risk of slow economic growth persisting worldwide.",
        "Other Council members assessed that the recovery in emerging economies, including, in particular, Asian countries, may be an important factor conducive to an economic revival all over the world.",
        "Those members indicated that the accelerated growth in emerging economies will be feeding through into the world economy mainly through the rise in those countries’ demand for investment goods, exported, to a large extent, by the developed countries of Western Europe.",
        "In the opinion of those Council members, the current recovery in Asia may be marking the beginning of these economies’ return to the potential growth path which may run at a relatively high level due to the ongoing process of real convergence in these economies.",
        "While discussing the outlook for economic growth in Poland, some Council members assessed that the Polish economy had already entered the phase of recovery, although some of them emphasised that this recovery may prove relatively slow.",
        "At the same time it was pointed out that the October projection forecast only a slight acceleration of growth in 2010.",
        "It was emphasised that the relatively low GDP growth may be the result of a drop in real disposable income of households connected with a rise in unemployment and a decline in real wages as well as more difficult access to credit.",
        "Some Council members assessed that the latest macroeconomic data, including those on exports, output and retail sales, did not indicate unambiguously the beginning of a sustainable recovery in the Polish economy.",
        "While discussing current inflation developments, it was pointed out that, despite the fact that in September 2009 inflation had fallen to 3.4%, i.e.",
        "below the upper limit for deviations from the inflation target (3.5%), it might nevertheless continue at a heightened level in the near future.",
        "This high level of inflation would be driven primarily by the positive base effect connected with a strong drop in fuel prices at the end of 2008.",
        "Some members of the Council pointed to the continuation of the relatively high level of core inflation, including the persistently high growth of prices of services.",
        "It was pointed out that Poland was one of the three EU countries with highest inflation.",
        "Other Council members argued that the difference in the levels of inflation in Poland and in other EU countries was connected with a smaller scale of economic activity weakening in Poland and with the process of price convergence of the Polish economy to price levels recorded in developed Western European economies.",
        "While discussing the outlook for inflation in Poland, the Council addressed the projection and the short-term inflation forecasts of the NBP which foresee inflation declining below the inflation target of 2.5% in the middle of 2010.",
        "In the opinion of some members of the Council this course of future inflation will follow from weaker consumption demand, persistently low wage pressure and the appreciation of nominal zloty exchange rate so far.",
        "Those members also pointed out that the October projection indicated a higher risk of inflation declining in 2010 below the lower limit for deviations from the inflation target of the NBP (1.5%) than the June projection.",
        "Other Council members indicated that the discrepancy between the short-term forecasts of core inflation, food and energy prices and their forecasts in the October projection pointed to a significant uncertainty as to the path of inflation in the coming quarters.",
        "In particular, some Council members assessed that the growth of food prices in the nearest future may prove higher than in the October projection.",
        "Those members additionally pointed to recently observed oil-price rises in the world markets and to the uncertainty about natural gas prices in Poland.",
        "Moreover, some Council members argued that the recovery in emerging economies, where economic growth raises the demand for raw materials, may be conducive to a resurge in the prices of agricultural and energy commodities in the world markets, especially in a situation where no limits exist on open investment positions in some forward commodity markets.",
        "In the opinion of those Council members, this may lead to higher inflation around the world and in Poland.",
        "At the meeting the Council also discussed the risk of increases of administered prices in 2010, including the prices decided by local authorities, resulting from the unfavourable situation of the public finance sector.",
        "While addressing the outlook for inflation in 2011, some members of the Council pointed out that, in line with the October projection the probabilities of inflation running below and above the inflation target were similar towards the end of the projection horizon.",
        "Moreover, some Council members argued that, following a drop to a low level foreseen in the middle of 2010, inflation would be steadily increasing till the end of the projection horizon.",
        "Other Council members, on the other hand, emphasised that for the most part of the projection horizon the probability of inflation running below the target was higher than the probability of its running above the target.",
        "Those members indicated that 2011 inflation being higher in the October projection than in the June projection was partially a result of a positive base effect connected with a deeper decline in food prices forecast for 2010.",
        "They also emphasised the issue of the optimal forecast horizon in central banks pursuing inflation targeting and stressed that the limited projection horizon increased the uncertainty about the durability of inflation changes in the final period of the forecast horizon.",
        "While discussing the future exchange rate and its impact on inflation in Poland, it was pointed out that the projection assumed a gradual depreciation of the zloty exchange rate, which was connected with a decreasing real interest rate disparity, the persistently high budget deficit and growing public debt.",
        "Some Council members, however, pointed to the possibility of zloty exchange rate appreciation, which could be supported by Poland’s relatively favourable economic situation as compared to other EU countries and the continuously high surplus liquidity in the global financial markets.",
        "Moreover, in the opinion of those Council members, should the recovery in emerging markets come faster than in developed economies, emerging economies’ currencies, including the zloty, could be expected to appreciate.",
        "Those members further emphasised that the potential zloty appreciation would be conducive to lower economic growth and lower inflation in the Polish economy than those accounted for in the October projection.",
        "Other Council members, however, assessed that an appreciation of the zloty exchange rate significantly exceeding the appreciation of the equilibrium exchange rate was unlikely in case the growth of the Polish economy remained close to the October projection of GDP.",
        "Those members pointed out that the zloty could depreciate due to a possible increase in the risk premium, which in turn might be driven by an unfavourable situation of the public finance sector, a lack of structural reforms in the Polish economy and Poland’s postponed adoption of the euro.",
        "While analysing the situation in the credit market, some members of the Council assessed that it was still deteriorating, which was, among others, indicated by a further decline in the growth of credit to households and very low growth of credit to enterprises.",
        "Other members of the Council, however, pointed to the fact that in September 2009 the value of granted loans in month-on-month terms had risen for the first time in five months, both in the case of loans to households and to enterprises.",
        "Moreover, some Council members emphasised that the slow growth of loans to enterprises was connected with their relatively good financial results and with their curbing their investment activity, and any recovery in lending to the enterprise sector might come only once the outlook for growth in the Polish economy significantly improved.",
        "Other Council members argued that reduced lending was, on the one hand, connected with households being more cautious while incurring liabilities amid slowing economic growth and rising unemployment, and, on the other hand, with an increased credit risk perceived by banks as indicated, among others, by the tightening of loan terms in the segment of consumer loans introduced in 2009 Q3 as well as planned for the future.",
        "While discussing real interest rates in the context of the credit market situation, some Council members indicated that real interest rates remaining at a relatively low level for too long in a country undergoing real convergence may be increasing the risk of a credit boom in the medium term.",
        "Those members pointed out that real interest rates were currently lower than the equilibrium interest rate for the Polish economy.",
        "At the same time, those members suggested that the expected inflation decrease should translate into an increase in real interest rates, which in turn should be conducive to a rise in household saving following a strong decline in 2009 Q1, as well as to curbing the risk of excessive lending growth.",
        "While considering the decision on interest rates, the Council concluded that the information on the economic situation released since the last meeting warranted keeping the interest rates unchanged at the current meeting.",
        "Some members of the Council were of the opinion that in the conditions of continuing uncertainty about the recovery in the world economy and about the outlook for economic growth in Poland, as well as in the light of the October inflation projection predicting inflation to be below the NBP’s inflation target for the most part of the projection horizon, it was justified to assess that in the medium term the probability of inflation running below the inflation target was higher than the probability of inflation overshooting the target.",
        "Other members of the Council argued that the recovery in the world and Polish economies combined with the risk of commodity price increases in the world markets and administered price rises in Poland, as well as the balanced probabilities of inflation running above or below the inflation target in the final period of the October projection, warranted the assessment that the probabilities of inflation in the medium term running below or above the inflation target were balanced.",
        "The majority of Council members judged the probability of inflation running below or above the inflation target to be balanced in the medium term.",
        "In the assessment of some Council members balanced risks to future inflation should indicate that the interest rates in the coming months would remain unchanged, which does not rule out the possibility of their adjustment in case of developments that would significantly affect the outlook for inflation and economic growth.",
        "The Council kept the interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 3.50%, the lombard rate at 5.00%, the deposit rate at 2.00% and the rediscount rate at 3.75%.",
        "During the meeting the Monetary Policy Council discussed the outlook for inflation in the context of the past, current and, primarily, anticipated economic situation.",
        "The discussion at the meeting focused on the outlook for economic growth in Poland and abroad, situation and outlook for public finance, inflation developments in Poland, zloty exchange rate developments and credit market situation.",
        "While discussing the domestic economic growth, it was noted that the decline in exports, industrial output and retail sales in the first months of 2009 confirm a considerable slowdown in the economic activity in Poland.",
        "Yet, some members of the Council pointed out that better than expected macroeconomic data and a slight improvement in some business climate indicators in March 2009 might be a sign of a low-level stabilization of the activity in the Polish economy.",
        "Other members argued that a minor decline in industrial output and higher than expected rise in wages in March 2009 might be linked to a different than in 2008 holiday calendar, and some business climate indicators continue to indicate a further deterioration in the activity in the enterprise sector and a decline in demand in the Polish economy.",
        "While addressing the outlook for domestic economic growth it was pointed out that due to a considerable – albeit not so high as in the majority of other countries of Central and Eastern Europe – openness of the economy, the global economic situation and related changes in demand for Polish exports are the factor of uncertainty to the economic situation in Poland.",
        "In this context, attention was paid to the deepening recession in the euro area and activity in the United States continuing at low level as well as to further downward revision of growth forecast for the global economy.",
        "The forecasts of considerable decline in GDP in 2009 in the German economy and in non-EU economies being Poland’s major trading partners were indicated.",
        "However, at the same time, attention was also paid to a slight improvement in the situation in global financial markets and some signs suggesting that an intensification of unfavourable developments in the global economy had been halted.",
        "Some members of the Council pointed out that improvement in exports might, in the later part of the year, constitute a factor driving recovery of the Polish economy which would, however, depend on zloty exchange rate developments.",
        "Other members of the Council assessed that changes in foreign demand might be of higher importance for the outlook for Polish exports than zloty exchange rate developments.",
        "While analyzing the exchange rate developments, it was pointed out that the previously observed depreciation of the zloty had been halted.",
        "Yet, at the same time it was indicated that developments in exchange rates of currencies of emerging economies, including the zloty exchange rate, currently depended largely on changes in risk aversion in the international financial markets.",
        "Moreover, some members of the Council emphasized that postponement of the zloty joining the ERM II might be conducive to its depreciation.",
        "They also pointed out that worse than previously expected situation of the public finance sector might be another factor increasing the risk of zloty depreciation.",
        "While discussing the situation in the public finance sector it was pointed out that the sector’s deficit in 2008 was considerably higher than the one assumed by the government in the December 2008 Convergence Program.",
        "In this context, reference was made to the factors which contributed to considerably higher than anticipated deficit level.",
        "Some members of the Council emphasized that amidst the strong slowdown of economic activity it was likely that the budget deficit would exceed the level assumed for 2009 or budget expenditures would be cut.",
        "Some Council members also pointed out that possible implementation of additional anti-crisis measures might contribute to a rise in the budget deficit in the coming years.",
        "It was indicated that uncertainty about the fiscal situation, both of the central government and other entities of the public finance sector, hindered the assessment of its impact on the outlook for inflation in Poland.",
        "While addressing the prospects of compliance with the Maastricht fiscal criterion it was assessed that as a result of strong deterioration in the economic situation in Poland, the deficit of the public finance sector in relation to GDP might increase considerably in the years 2009 and 2010.",
        "In this context, it was pointed out that fulfillment of the Maastricht fiscal criterion in the coming years might be impeded.",
        "While discussing the current inflation developments, it was indicated that a rise in consumer price index in March 2009 up to 3.6% i.e.",
        "above the upper limit for deviations from the NBP inflation target set at the level of 3.5% had mostly been driven by a rise in food prices.",
        "It was also pointed out that the growth in regulated prices, including, in particular, rises in the prices of energy and prices related with maintenance of dwellings continued to be the factor boosting inflation.",
        "It was stressed that a rise in inflation had been driven by the previously observed zloty exchange rate depreciation and that exchange rate developments continued to be the main risk factor for price stability.",
        "Some members of the Council assessed, at the same time, that – taking into account the zloty appreciation observed since the middle of February 2009 – the impact of the previously observed depreciation of the zloty exchange rate on inflation may be rather short-lived.",
        "Other members of the Council argued that higher than expected rise in inflation in March 2009 indicated that even amidst strong economic slowdown, exchange rate depreciation translates significantly into a rise in consumer prices in Poland.",
        "While addressing the outlook for inflation in Poland, some members of the Council assessed that in the medium term inflation should decline to the inflation target which was also suggested by the February inflation projection and short-term forecasts prepared by the NBP.",
        "This might be favoured by declining domestic demand and falling labour demand translating into a gradual fall in wage pressure and by the commodity prices continuing at relatively low levels.",
        "Those members also argued that a fall in inflationary expectations of households should contribute to a decline in inflation.",
        "Other members of the Council pointed, however, to the risk of inflation persisting at an increased level in the case of shocks affecting food and energy commodity markets.",
        "Moreover, some members of the Council indicated that considerable worsening in the situation of the public finance sector might urge the government to increase budget income through rises of indirect taxes, including excise tax, and local governments – to increase the prices of services depending on their decisions, which would, in turn, contribute to higher inflation.",
        "The Council also discussed the prospects of Poland’s compliance with the Maastricht price stability criterion.",
        "Some Council members indicated that amidst inflation in some EU countries falling to very low levels the reference value for price stability criterion in 2010 might run considerably below the 12-month moving average HICP inflation in Poland.",
        "In the opinion of those members fast disinflation in Poland that would enable to fulfill again the Maastricht criterion might then require considerable tightening of the monetary policy.",
        "At the same time, some members of the Council pointed out that the developments of HIPC inflation in Poland against the reference value for price stability criterion in the coming years would largely depend upon changes in regulated prices.",
        "While discussing the credit market situation, some members of the Council pointed out that banks in Poland currently focused their lending activity on consumer loan market.",
        "Interest rates on consumer loans slightly increased despite NBP interest rate cuts implemented since November 2008.",
        "Moreover, they argued that excessive rise in households’ burden resulting from servicing consumer loans might – through rising value of irregular loans – lead to deterioration in banks’ capital adequacy ratios and, in consequence, result in limiting future lending.",
        "Other members of the Council pointed out, however, that the rise in the value of consumer loans was lower than last year, and the share of consumer loans in the total loans was relatively small.",
        "Members of the Council also discussed strong reduction in corporate lending in 2009 Q1.",
        "It was pointed out that banks’ tightening of their lending conditions, partly connected with persisting uncertainty about future economic developments hindering the assessment of the credit risk, constituted the factor limiting corporate lending.",
        "Some members of the Council assessed that in order to intensify corporate lending further modifications of the monetary policy instruments might be necessary.",
        "At the meeting, the Council also addressed the possibility of Poland obtaining the IMF flexible credit line.",
        "It was emphasized that the flexible credit line is aimed at countries with strong economic fundamentals which used to pursue a responsible macroeconomic policy in the past and which are likely to continue such a policy in the future.",
        "It was pointed out that Poland’s access to the IMF funds might favour the exchange rate stabilization and indirectly facilitate obtaining the funds to finance the budget deficit and public debt in foreign markets as well as to reduce debt service costs.",
        "The Council analysed also the impact of Poland’s access to the flexible credit line on the outlook for inflation in Poland.",
        "The meeting also focused on dilemmas connected with the interest rate policy in the longer term.",
        "It was pointed out that recovery in the global economy would require considerable tightening of macroeconomic policy in many countries, which might be difficult both due to the scale of the implemented anti-crisis instruments and uncertainty about the sustainability of such economic recovery.",
        "In this context, some members of the Council pointed out that lowering the NBP interest rates currently to excessively low levels might later on require a relatively faster and stronger tightening of the monetary policy in order to stabilize inflation at the level of the inflation target.",
        "Moreover, it was pointed out that excessive interest rate cuts might – in the situation of further deterioration of the economic climate or economic stagnation – limit the possibility of lowering interest rates in the future in order to support economic growth in Poland.",
        "Some members of the Council indicated that the real ex post interest rate (deflated with current headline inflation) in Poland was lower than in the euro area.",
        "Besides, it was pointed out that – according to the short-term forecasts prepared at the NBP – in April 2009 inflation might exceed the current level of the NBP reference rate, and, as a result, the real interest rate would be negative.",
        "Yet, it was also indicated that amidst the unfavourable economic climate and persisting uncertainty about future economic developments, a fall in real interest rates to the negative levels might have a limited impact on households’ propensity to save.",
        "In this context, attention was paid to considerable decline in the monetary policy restrictiveness, which was driven – apart from interest rate cuts – also by the previously observed significant weakening of the zloty exchange rate.",
        "Members of the Council agreed that uncertainty about the outlook for economic recovery in Poland and abroad, the situation in the public finance sector and zloty exchange rate developments and their impact on inflation justified keeping the NBP interest rates unchanged at the current meeting.",
        "Moreover, some members of the Council indicated that also very low level of real interest rates spoke in favour of leaving the NBP interest rates unchanged.",
        "The majority of the Council members maintained the opinion that the probability of inflation running below the inflation target in the medium term was higher than the probability of inflation running above the target.",
        "The Council kept the interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 3.75%, the lombard rate at 5.25%, the deposit rate at 2.25% and the rediscount rate at 4.00%.",
        "During the meeting the Monetary Policy Council discussed the outlook for future inflation developments in the context of the past, current and, primarily, anticipated economic situation.",
        "The discussion at the meeting focused on the outlook for economic growth abroad and in Poland, inflationary processes in Poland and the situation in the labour and credit markets.",
        "While assessing the situation in developed economies, it was pointed out that following several quarters of decline 2009 Q3 brought a rise in GDP in the United States and in the euro area, including Germany, Italy and France, i.e.",
        "major markets for Polish exports.",
        "Yet, it was emphasised that the recovery in those economies was, to a large extent, the effect of government stimulus packages.",
        "It was assessed that the prospective discontinuation of these measures was accompanied by a risk of decline in economic activity in those countries, mainly due to a possible fall in private consumption growth.",
        "It was pointed out that economic growth in the United States and in the euro area was also negatively affected by a decline in corporate loans and, in the longer term also by the deteriorating situation of the public finance sector.",
        "While analysing the situation in emerging economies, some members of the Council pointed out that the recovery in those economies might not be sufficient to boost global GDP growth considerably.",
        "Those members also noted that although private consumption in China might be expected to accelerate in the coming period this would be unlikely to compensate for the impact of a possible consumption decline in the United States on global economic growth due to a low level of private consumption in China relative to global demand.",
        "An important factor curbing growth in consumption expenditure in this country is the absence of a universal social security system, as a result of which an important part of household income is saved.",
        "While discussing the outlook for domestic economic growth, it was assessed that the Polish economy had already entered the phase of recovery, which was confirmed, among other things, by increasing industrial output growth and very good financial results of enterprises in 2009 Q3.",
        "It was also indicated that the recovery abroad (particularly in the euro area) contributed to growth in Polish exports in 2009 Q3, as indicated by the data for the past three months.",
        "Some members of the Council believed that the recovery would be relatively slow, and argued that in the coming period economic growth in Poland might likely be curbed by a renewed deterioration in global economic climate.",
        "In the opinion of those Council members, GDP growth in Poland would be negatively affected also by such factors as: the deteriorating situation in the labour market, including rising unemployment and the fall in real wages in the enterprise sector, the decline in corporate loans and lending to households growing more slowly than in the last years, as well as the difficult situation of the public finance sector.",
        "In the opinion of other members of the Council, GDP growth in Poland dropping notably again was very unlikely even in the event of a considerable deterioration in the global economy.",
        "They argued that the scale of GDP growth decline in Poland due to the global financial crisis was considerably smaller than in other European Union countries, and emphasised that despite the absence of  Warszawa Świętokrzy ska  no (22)  51 government stimulus packages of a scale comparable to those implemented abroad GDP growth in Poland remained positive.",
        "It was assessed that the relatively high resilience of the Polish economy to unfavourable external shocks – the turmoil in the global financial markets and the recession abroad – was, among other things, the result of a low credit-to-GDP ratio and the economy’s lower degree of openness as compared to other EU countries, as well as of the dynamic development of the service sector (less dependent on global economic developments) observed in the past few years.",
        "It was also emphasised that the relatively small scale of economic slowdown was largely due to a marked decrease in the NBP interest rates as well as the depreciation of the zloty exchange rate.",
        "While addressing the labour market situation, members of the Council pointed to persisting unfavourable trends, including in particular the growth in registered unemployment and the continuing negative annual employment growth, as well as the decline in real wages in the enterprise sector in October 2009.",
        "Some members of the Council pointed out that in the light of the October projection of the NBP, nominal wage growth in subsequent quarters would decline further.",
        "Moreover, some members of the Council argued that due to lags in the adjustment of employment to the pace of economic growth and a likely increase in labour supply, unemployment could increase further in the coming period despite economic recovery.",
        "They assessed that rising unemployment would be conducive to lowering the inflationary pressure through weaker consumer demand and limited wage pressure.",
        "At the same time, some members of the Council pointed out that rising unemployment might, due to the hysteresis effect, negatively affect the potential GDP growth in the coming period.",
        "While analysing the relationship between inflation and labour market developments, some members of the Council emphasised that elevated inflation contributed to lowering real wages, facilitating their adjustment to falling labour productivity growth.",
        "In the opinion of those Council members, relatively high flexibility of real wages helped to reduce the scale of decline in Poland’s GDP growth amid the global recession.",
        "They also pointed to the so-called labour hoarding, consisting in incomplete adjustment of employment (i.e.",
        "reduced lay-offs) during an economic slowdown.",
        "On the other hand, they emphasised that via indexation increased inflation contributed to wage growth in the public finance sector as well as to growth in disability and old-age pension benefits, which, in the short term, is conducive to deepening the deficit of the public finance sector.",
        "In the opinion of those members of the Council, rising social benefits driven by indexation amid a concurrent decline in wage growth in the economy reduced work attractiveness and might negatively affect the economic activity of Poles.",
        "They also made reference to the data on wages in the national economy which in the first three quarters of 2009 – unlike in the previous period – showed higher annual growth than wages in the enterprise sector.",
        "According to those Council members, this might indicate that the share of this sector in the national economy was declining and, consequently, that the changes in wages in the enterprise sector – where wages are largely dependent on cyclical conditions – might in the future affect wage developments in the economy to a lesser extent than previously had been the case.",
        "While discussing inflation developments, it was pointed out that in October 2009 annual CPI decreased to 3.1%, which was primarily the result of slower growth of food and energy prices; at the same time, core inflation (net of food and energy prices) remained at 2.9%.",
        "Some Council members emphasised that core inflation continuing at a heightened level was the effect, among other things, of steady growth in the prices of services.",
        "Those members assessed that the gradual increase in the demand for services observed over the recent years, which resulted in a growing share of this spending category in the basket of consumer goods and services, would also continue in the coming years, and so the prices of services would be exerting a growing impact on CPI developments.",
        "They emphasised that core inflation had not been falling despite a clearly negative output gap and pointed out that the current level of annual core inflation rate could still be to some extent influenced by the high demand pressure observed in the previous period.",
        "Other members of the Council stressed, however, that elevated CPI inflation was to a considerable degree driven by unfavourable price shocks, including in particular the administered price increases implemented in 2009.",
        "Some Council members also pointed to the reduced scale of decline in the prices of goods strongly affected by globalisation recorded in the recent months, which was partially connected with the earlier zloty exchange rate depreciation.",
        "While discussing the outlook for inflation, it was pointed out that in the near term the annual CPI would develop largely under the influence of statistical base effects: first, a positive one – connected with a strong decline in fuel prices at the end of 2008, and then, a negative one – connected with considerable increases in administered prices and food price rises at the beginning of 2009 (provided the lack of equally strong administered price increases in 2010).",
        "Due to the former effect inflation would rise temporarily in the nearest future, while the latter effect would be conducive to its decrease next year.",
        "Some Council members indicated that in 2010 a drop in CPI inflation below the NBP inflation target could be expected as the negative output gap would likely persist.",
        "Another factor conducive to decreasing inflation could be the appreciation of the zloty so far.",
        "Other Council members pointed out that the inflation decline might be curbed by indirect tax and administered price increases.",
        "They also argued that inflation might prove higher than currently expected in the event of unfavourable price shocks in the commodity or food markets, or zloty exchange rate depreciation.",
        "In the opinion of those Council members in the longer term the inflationary pressure would be largely determined by labour and credit market situation.",
        "While addressing the current situation in the domestic credit market, its further deterioration was highlighted, including especially the negative annual growth of lending to enterprises (adjusted for the impact of zloty exchange rate fluctuations) observed in October for the first time since 2004, and the fact that the growth of lending to households was persistently slower than in the preceding years.",
        "Some Council members argued that the reduction in the supply of credit to enterprises contributed to curbing corporate investment, which in turn adversely affected GDP growth.",
        "Other Council members, however, assessed that reduced lending was to a large extent attributable to the limited demand for credit resulting from the economic slowdown.",
        "They emphasised that in view of the data on financial results of enterprises in 2009 Q3, the liquidity of this sector remained relatively high, allowing firms to finance their current operations to a large extent with their own funds, and thus constrained their borrowing needs.",
        "They also pointed out that lending to households was still growing.",
        "The Council also analysed the development of the credit market in the longer-term perspective.",
        "Some members of the Council emphasised that the credit-to-GDP ratio in Poland in the period preceding the global financial crisis had been among the lowest in the EU.",
        "Other Council members underlined that in the past few years this ratio had increased significantly.",
        "They argued that, even though the rapid credit expansion in the years preceding the global crisis had largely resulted from the convergence process, in the longer term sustaining such fast lending growth could lead to growing credit market imbalances.",
        "They assessed that the current slowdown in lending was to a large extent a cyclical phenomenon and that it would be conducive to a more balanced lending growth.",
        "Those members argued that the recovery in economic growth would give a new momentum to lending growth in connection with the convergence process and due to demographic changes leading to a rising demand for mortgage loans.",
        "In the assessment of those Council members, the current situation in the credit market did not necessitate the introduction of any additional instruments to support lending growth.",
        "While discussing the policy mix abroad and in Poland, some Council members pointed out that expansionary fiscal policies in many countries led to rising public debt levels which – amid efforts to sustain price stability – could only be halted by strong fiscal tightening.",
        "At the same time, however, low real interest rates around the world, driven by loose monetary policy, limited the current costs of financing public debt, thus weakening the incentives to implement reforms aimed at the improvement of the primary balance of the public finance sector.",
        "In this context, those members emphasised the need for introducing measures that would curb the expansion of public debt in Poland.",
        "The Council assessed that the data on the economic situation in Poland and abroad released since its last meeting warranted maintaining the interest rates unchanged at the current meeting.",
        "The Council kept the interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 3.50%, the lombard rate at 5.00%, the deposit rate at 2.00% and the rediscount rate at 3.75%.",
        "During the meeting the Monetary Policy Council discussed the outlook for inflation in the context of the past, current and, primarily, anticipated economic situation.",
        "The discussion at the meeting focused on the outlook for economic growth abroad and in Poland, the medium-term inflation outlook, fiscal policy and the situation in the banking sector.",
        "The Council paid considerable attention to the external conditions affecting the Polish economy.",
        "It was emphasised that the data on the United States, including the growth in industrial output and retail sales, improved situation in the real estate market and a further rise in economic sentiment indicators signal recovery in the US economy.",
        "While addressing the situation in the euro area, it was pointed out that despite some improvement in economic sentiment indicators, data on the real economy indicated that recovery in the euro area would likely materialise with a certain time lag with respect to the US economy.",
        "Some members of the Council argued that rising unemployment in the United States and in the euro area remained a risk factor to the sustainability of the recovery in the world economy.",
        "In this context, attention was drawn to the unfavourable outlook for recovery in private consumption amid deteriorating situation in the labour market in those economies and the expected fading out of fiscal stimulus packages at the end of 2010 as well as the possibility of central banks moving to the socalled exit strategy from expansionary monetary policy.",
        "Other members of the Council pointed out that additional factors having a negative bearing on the outlook for consumption in the United States included rising household savings and the private sector’s limited access to mortgage loans due to the considerable decline in real estate prices in the US that triggered the crisis in the banking sector.",
        "In turn, while discussing the situation in the euro area, those members emphasised that rising imports of investment goods to China might have largely contributed to the easing of recessionary tendencies in the euro area in 2009 Q2.",
        "In the opinion of those Council members, a possible weakening of external demand following the fading out of the stimulus package in the Chinese economy was a source of risk to the sustainability of the recovery in the euro area.",
        "While addressing the outlook for global economic growth, some members of the Council pointed out that although private consumption in the United States and in the euro area might prove weak, the rise in demand in major emerging economies, undergoing the process of real convergence and recording significantly higher GDP growth than developed countries, would translate into a sustainable recovery in the external environment of the Polish economy.",
        "Those Council members also argued that the recovery in economic activity both in the United States and the euro area would be accompanied by a gradual rise in labour productivity which might be expected in view of the fact that the crisis affecting both economies had stemmed from problems in the financial sector rather than from real economy developments.",
        "In the opinion of those Council members, GDP growth of the major economies was likely to return to their potential growth level relatively fast.",
        "While discussing the outlook for inflation in the world economy, some members of the Council emphasised that the difficult situation in the labour market affecting major developed economies  Warszawa Świętokrzy ska  no (22)  51 and a relatively low demand pressure, combined with the weakening of the upward trend in oil prices in August 2009, would be curbing inflation in the coming quarters.",
        "While discussing the situation in the Polish economy, it was pointed out that data on GDP in 2009 Q2 proved slightly better than expected.",
        "At the same time it was emphasised that GDP growth mainly resulted from the positive contribution of net exports due to a smaller decline of exports than imports, amid a fall in domestic demand following from further consumption deceleration and lower investment and inventories.",
        "While addressing the data for August 2009, it was stressed, on the one hand, that the growth of industrial output and retail sales had fallen short of expectations and, on the other hand, that economic sentiment indicators had further improved.",
        "Some Council members pointed out that the growth of exports was still negative, while the expected slight recovery in euro-area activity would probably fail to immediately translate into a significant rise in the external demand for Polish products.",
        "It was argued that a possible further appreciation of zloty exchange rate, through worsening the price competitiveness of domestic goods, might be conducive to weakening the positive contribution of net exports to GDP growth in the coming quarters.",
        "Those Council members also pointed to the persistent unfavourable situation in the labour market as a factor contributing to lower consumption and, consequently, weaker economic activity.",
        "In the opinion of those members, considering the still unfavourable outlook for private investment growth and the risk of public investment cuts in the face of public finance sector deterioration, there persisted considerable uncertainty as to the perspectives of economic growth in the Polish economy.",
        "Other Council members, however, argued that the expected recovery in the world economy would be a factor supporting domestic GDP growth.",
        "Moreover, in the opinion of those members, the scale of labour market deterioration would not be as strong as previously anticipated, in particular due to the fact that the employment decline should be curbed by lower real wages.",
        "They assessed – as a result – that the impact of the unfavourable labour market situation on consumption would be rather limited.",
        "While analysing inflation developments, it was pointed out that the slight inflation increase in August 2009 was primarily due to a weaker seasonal drop in food prices amid an unchanged level of core inflation net of food and energy prices.",
        "Some Council members argued that in line with the majority of available forecasts, in the next few months inflation may temporarily remain at a heightened level, yet in 2010 inflation could be expected to fall even below the inflation target.",
        "A significant drop in inflation in 2010 would be driven – in the opinion of those members – by the delayed effects of labour market deterioration resulting both in reduced consumption demand of households and slower growth of costs in enterprises.",
        "The same Council members indicated that the inflation decrease would also be supported by the recent exchange rate appreciation and the stabilisation of commodity prices in the world markets.",
        "Other Council members emphasised that a gradual recovery of economic growth should translate into higher demand, while the negative output gap might close up earlier than anticipated.",
        "Moreover, the heightened level of inflation, including the continuing growth in the prices of services, did not confirm – in the opinion of those Council members – a significant easing of demand pressure, which could be expected considering the strong weakening of GDP growth.",
        "While addressing forecasts, those members argued that inflation in 2009 Q2 and Q3 proved markedly higher than expected in the June projection.",
        "In the opinion of those members of the Council it could also be expected that the forecast inflation decrease below the target in 2010 may prove short-lived.",
        "Those members argued that in line with the current short-term forecasts the expected inflation decrease in 2010 to a large extent was to result from a strong deceleration of food price growth, which is rather unlikely considering the average price growth in this group of goods over the past few years.",
        "Moreover, while discussing the outlook for inflation, the Council pointed to the risk of an increase of regulated prices and indirect taxes in 2010 which, on the one hand, directly translate into a rise of the general price level and, on the other hand, bring about a reduction in the purchasing power of households and an easing of the demand pressure curbing inflation.",
        "During the discussion on the public finance sector, some Council members pointed out that the rise of the deficit and public debt in relation to GDP resulted, to a large extent, from a strong slowdown in economic growth.",
        "It was argued that other EU countries also experienced a significant increase in public finance imbalances whose scale was even greater than in Poland.",
        "Other Council members, however, emphasised that of importance to foreign investors would be the comparison of the ratios of the deficit and public debt to GDP in countries of Central and Eastern Europe, including Poland, to the respective ratios in emerging countries characterised by lower fiscal imbalances.",
        "In this context it was argued that the deteriorating fiscal stance could be contributing to a weakening of the zloty exchange rate.",
        "While addressing the planned increase of the public finance imbalance in 2010, some discussants pointed out that a strong rise in the deficit of the public finance sector could justify monetary policy tightening.",
        "At the same time, those members pointed out that even though a rise in public spending amid low economic activity supports GDP growth, the dominant effect triggered by a recovery could be the so-called crowding out effect where private sector demand is crowded out by public expenditure.",
        "Other Council members argued that the anticipated increase in the deficit of the public finance sector would primarily be the effect of automatic stabilisers rather than anticyclical measures introduced in the fiscal policy, which did not restrict the possibility of maintaining an accommodative monetary policy.",
        "At the meeting, the Council also discussed issues related to the banking sector.",
        "Some Council members argued that the tightening of banks’ credit policy towards the corporate sector was very strong, which could lead to a considerable reduction of economic growth.",
        "In this context the Council had a discussion on improving the access to bank loans for the corporate sector by introducing new monetary policy instruments by the central bank, similarly as it is done by the world’s major central banks.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members, introducing new instruments, i.e.",
        "bill discount credit and the central bank’s purchase of bonds issued by commercial banks, would allow banks to increase their lending.",
        "Those members argued that the launching of new instruments could make it easier for enterprises to obtain both short-term loans, which would limit the risk of enterprises experiencing liquidity shortage, and long-term loans, which would limit the scale of investment reductions.",
        "In the opinion of those Council members, the way of implementation and the character of new instruments reduced the risk of excessive interference of the central bank in banks’ credit risk management system.",
        "Other members of the Council, however, emphasised that the reduction in bank lending was a typical phenomenon accompanying economic slowdown and resulted not only from the rationing of credit supply and the increased cost of credit but also from diminished demand for credit on the part of enterprises.",
        "During the discussion it was also pointed out that the scale of lending reduction in Poland was smaller than in other countries of Central and Eastern Europe.",
        "While addressing the measures implemented by other central banks, those Council members argued that Poland was in a better economic situation as compared to countries, which were introducing unconventional monetary policy measures.",
        "At the same time, those members emphasised that introducing the proposed instruments could in fact contribute to widening the financing gap of banks (i.e.",
        "the difference between the collected deposits and granted loans).",
        "Those members also argued that easier access to central bank funds might demotivate banks to properly assess their credit risk.",
        "Moreover, in the opinion of those Council members, the central bank should not increase the capital base of banks by issuing money, and investments in the economy should be financed primarily from savings.",
        "In the opinion of those Council members, introducing new instruments would pose the risk of excessive money creation in the economy.",
        "While considering the decision on the interest rates, the Council assessed that the information on economic developments released since the last MPC meeting justified keeping the rates unchanged at the current meeting.",
        "Some members of the Council believed that available data – including higher than expected GDP growth in 2009 Q2 and inflation remaining above the target and above the June projection – as well as further improvement in the outlook for economic activity justified the assessment that the probabilities of inflation running above and below the inflation target in the medium term were roughly equal.",
        "Other Council members argued, however, that the uncertainty about the scale and durability of economic recovery abroad and in Poland was still high and a more comprehensive assessment of the macroeconomic situation would be possible once the Council got acquainted with the October projection of inflation and GDP.",
        "At the meeting, the prevailing view was that the probability of inflation running below the inflation target in the medium term was higher than the probability of inflation running above the target.",
        "At the same time, the majority of the Council members assessed that the probability of inflation running below the inflation target in the medium term had decreased in recent months.",
        "The Council kept the interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 3.50%, the lombard rate at 5.00%, the deposit rate at 2.00% and the rediscount rate at 3.75%.",
        "During the meeting the Monetary Policy Council discussed the outlook for inflation in the context of the past, current and, primarily, anticipated economic situation.",
        "The discussion at the meeting focused on the outlook for economic growth abroad and in Poland, fiscal policy, zloty exchange rate developments and the situation in the credit market and the banking sector.",
        "The Council discussed the impact of those factors on future inflation in Poland against the background of the June projection of inflation and GDP.",
        "While discussing the domestic economic growth, it was pointed out that decline in industrial output and very low growth of construction and assembly production in May 2009 confirmed the subdued economic activity in Poland.",
        "Some members of the Council pointed out that many macroeconomic indicators released recently, including the output data, were better than expected and some economic activity indicators pointed currently at a possible improvement in the outlook for growth in Poland.",
        "Other members of the Council argued, however, that worsening economic indicators in retail trade might signal further shrinking of consumption demand, which is driven i.a.",
        "by the decline in real aggregate wage in the enterprise sector.",
        "Those members also pointed out that according to the NBP preliminary assessments investment in the Polish economy might have strongly declined in 2009 Q2.",
        "Those members also emphasized that the June projection of the NBP pointed at further considerable decline in GDP growth in the coming quarters.",
        "Moreover, some members of the Council emphasized that the decline in economic activity in Poland might be stronger than indicated by the projection.",
        "While discussing the external environment of the Polish economy, the successive signs of improvement in the outlook for world economic growth and stabilization of the situation in the global financial markets were pointed at.",
        "Yet, some members of the Council assessed that recession in the global economy might last longer that currently expected, and improvement of the situation in the financial markets might only be temporary.",
        "Those members emphasized that macroeconomic data did not univocally suggest that the downward trend in economic growth in the United States had been reversed.",
        "In the opinion of those members, recovery of the American economy would proceed gradually, which might delay the recovery of the euro zone and other developed economies.",
        "Those members indicated that 2009 was expected to bring a further strong decline in economic activity in the euro area and some forecasts pointed to the risk of GDP fall in this region also in 2010.",
        "While analyzing the situation in the public finance sector, it was pointed out that a low growth rate of budget income in the first five months of 2009, including a considerable decline in tax revenues, which, given the persistently high expenditure growth, had led to a rapid increase in budget deficit.",
        "Some members of the Council pointed out that in order to limit the decline in tax revenues in 2009, the government would strive to increase non-tax revenues, including dividends from companies with State Treasury participation, which, given the restricted access to loans, might be conducive to additional cuts in investment expenditure by those enterprises.",
        "At the same time, those members assessed that – despite possible increase in the proceeds from dividends – the decline in budget income in 2009 would probably exceed the government announced growth in the planned deficit,  Warszawa ulica Świętokrzyska telefon (22)  55  (22)  51 which would suggest the need of cuts in some expenditure areas.",
        "Those members emphasized that the cuts in budget expenditure already announced by the government as well as possible further cuts would be conducive to a fall in domestic demand.",
        "The possible rise in taxes in 2010 might also lead to curbing domestic demand.",
        "It was also pointed out that the uncertainty about the scale of the actual expenditure cuts and the areas likely to be affected by these cuts, including the uncertainty resulting from some expenses being shifted from the central government budget to other units of the general government sector, makes it difficult to assess the impact of the changes in fiscal policy on the outlook for domestic economic growth.",
        "While assessing the impact on inflation of changes in the situation of the general government sector and in the fiscal policy, the risk of a rise in inflation resulting from possible increases of regulated prices and indirect taxes in 2010 was indicated.",
        "Some members of the Council assessed that the rise in excise and VAT rates might be conducive to the CPI remaining at an increased level in 2010.",
        "Other members of the Council pointed out, however, that the possible tax increases and the government announced cuts in budget expenditure would be conducive to curbing domestic demand and, as a result, inflationary pressure.",
        "Those members also indicated that the rise in the budget deficit results mainly from the deteriorating economic conditions rather than from fiscal policy easing.",
        "While analyzing the changes in current inflation it was pointed out that CPI inflation had fallen to 3.6% in May 2009, remaining, however, above the upper limit for deviations from the inflation target, set at 3.5%.",
        "It was emphasized that the inflation decline in May 2009 had mainly been driven by the negative base effect related to a strong rise in gas and energy prices in the corresponding period of the previous year.",
        "Some members of the Council indicated that the growth rate of consumer prices in the first few months of 2009 exceeded the average from the last eight years, which, by means of a base effect, might be conducive to a decline in the year-on-year inflation rate at the beginning of 2010.",
        "Those members also pointed out that in 2009 inflation was likely to remain at an increased level which would be driven i.a.",
        "by the positive base effect connected with a sharp fall in fuel prices in the second half of 2008.",
        "While discussing the current inflation, some members of the Council also pointed out that inflation remaining above the upper limit for deviations from the inflation target was mainly connected with the previously effected increases in regulated prices and rising unprocessed food prices.",
        "Other members of the Council indicated that inflation was also driven – and would probably continue to be driven – by the persistence of inflationary processes.",
        "Moreover, they assessed that despite declining inflationary pressure some sectors of the economy continued to observe demand pressure as suggested i.a.",
        "by rising prices of market services.",
        "The meeting also focused on HICP inflation developments in Poland.",
        "Some members of the Council pointed out that the difference between the 12-month moving average HICP inflation in Poland and the reference value for the price stability criterion increased in May 2009 to 1.0 percentage points.",
        "Yet, other members of the Council emphasized that inflation in Poland was higher than in Western European countries mainly due to considerable rises in regulated prices, which were beyond the direct impact of monetary policy.",
        "The difference in inflation levels might also be driven by the previously observed depreciation of the zloty exchange rate and a smaller scale of economic slowdown in Poland.",
        "While discussing the outlook for inflation in Poland, attention was paid to the forecasted considerable decline in inflation in the projection horizon.",
        "Yet, some members of the Council pointed out that the situation in commodity and food futures markets pointed at the risk of a continuing upward trend in commodity and food prices, which might be conducive to rising inflation in Poland.",
        "Moreover, the decline in inflation might be curbed in the longer term by structural changes in the Polish economy boosting demand for market services.",
        "Those members also pointed out that in line with the projection in the years 2010-2011 CPI inflation should run below inflation net of food and energy prices which had not been observed since 2003.",
        "Other members of the Council emphasized, however, that the June projection of the NBP pointed at the considerable widening of the negative output gap leading to a strong decline in inflationary pressure over the monetary policy transmission horizon.",
        "Moreover, some members of the Council assessed that in the medium term inflation might run below the central path of the projection due to the risk of economic growth abroad being lower than assumed in the projection.",
        "They also pointed out that due to the relatively slow adjustment of employment in the first stage of the economic slowdown, employment growth, and consequently also the growth of unit labour costs, might in the longer term be lower than accounted for in the projection.",
        "Those members also assessed that amidst low demand the impact of rising unit labour costs on inflation might be relatively weak.",
        "Moreover, in the opinion of those members of the Council, the zloty exchange rate is currently significantly weaker than the medium-term equilibrium rate which suggests that it might be stronger than accounted for in the projection.",
        "While analyzing the developments in the exchange rate of the zloty, its relative stabilisation in the past few months was emphasized.",
        "On the other hand, it was pointed out that in May and June 2009 the zloty exchange rate had depreciated.",
        "It was stressed that at present zloty exchange rate fluctuations were impacted mainly by regional factors, in particular the unfavourable macroeconomic situation in some countries of Central and Eastern Europe.",
        "At the same time, attention was paid to the uncertainty about the impact on the zloty exchange rate of the worsening fiscal situation and the changing outlook for economic growth in Poland.",
        "On the other hand, some members of the Council assessed that the risk of zloty depreciation had considerably decreased as a result of improved sentiment in the global financial markets and was further mitigated by the relatively strong fundamentals of the Polish economy.",
        "While discussing the impact of zloty exchange rate fluctuations on the economy, it was pointed out that the previously observed zloty exchange rate depreciation contributed to inflation persisting at an increased level.",
        "Some members of the Council assessed, however, that amidst low demand the impact of zloty depreciation on inflation would gradually decline.",
        "Those members emphasized that the current level of the zloty exchange rate increased the competitiveness of Polish products in foreign markets and in the domestic market, which is reflected in the improved current account balance and curbs the decline in domestic production.",
        "While discussing the level of interest rates in Poland and abroad, it was pointed out that in the current situation the interest rate disparity between Poland and the euro area had a limited impact on zloty exchange rate developments.",
        "Yet, some members of the Council indicated that in the case of further decline in risk aversion in the international financial markets the currently observed disparity might boost the inflow of short-term capital to Poland.",
        "Other members of the Council pointed out, however, that this risk was mitigated by a still high level of risk premium prevalent in emerging economies.",
        "In the opinion of those members of the Council, the currently observed disparity was consistent with the higher natural interest rate and more favourable economic situation in Poland than in the euro area.",
        "Moreover, those members of the Council pointed out that ex post real interest rates (deflated with current headline inflation) in Poland were lower than in the euro area.",
        "While analyzing the situation in the credit market, further strong decline in the growth of lending to the private sector was indicated.",
        "Some members of the Council pointed at the growing credit risk both with regard to corporate loans and household loans.",
        "Those members indicated that a considerable increase in lending might take place only after banks’ concerns about the quality of their credit portfolios have abated.",
        "Moreover, they pointed out that limited lending was also driven by banks’ high liquidity preference connected with their focusing on the improvement of their balance sheet structure through increasing the share of liquid assets.",
        "Other members of the Council emphasized that the strengthening of banks’ capital base might support the increase in lending activity.",
        "In this context they assessed that the possible dividend payment by PKO BP would likely lead to a reduction in the supply of loans by this bank.",
        "Moreover, those members pointed out that if other banks also decided to pay out dividends, the financial stability risk might increase.",
        "While considering the decision on interest rates, some members of the Council argued that the considerable decline in inflation over the monetary policy transmission horizon anticipated in the June projection, further economic slowdown in Poland, the risk of long-lasting low economic activity abroad and the relatively tight fiscal policy stance, justified lowering the NBP interest rates at the current meeting.",
        "Other Council members argued, however, that the low level of real interest rates, current inflation remaining at a heightened level and the uncertainty about the outlook for inflation in Poland amidst growing commodity prices in the world markets and the still high volatility of the zloty exchange rate as well as risks connected with the future fiscal policy justified keeping the interest rates unchanged at the current meeting.",
        "A motion to lower the NBP interest rates by 25 basis points was put forward and passed.",
        "The Council decided to lower the NBP interest rates to the level: the reference rate to 3.50%, the lombard rate to 5.00%, the deposit rate to 2.00% and the rediscount rate to 3.75%.",
        "During the meeting the Monetary Policy Council discussed the outlook for inflation in the context of the past, current and, primarily, anticipated economic situation.",
        "The discussion at the meeting focused on the outlook for economic growth abroad and in Poland, medium-term inflation outlook, zloty exchange rate developments and credit market conditions.",
        "While discussing the external environment of the Polish economy it was pointed out that the data on the United States and the euro area, including the GDP data for 2009 Q2, indicate easing of recessionary tendencies in those economies.",
        "In particular, it was emphasised that GDP in quarterly terms grew in Germany and France, i.e.",
        "in countries being the most important markets for Polish exports.",
        "It was pointed out that GDP growth might have been driven by growing demand for exports of those countries reported by the Chinese economy, which was connected with the fiscal stimulus programme supporting public sector investment in China.",
        "It was indicated that since the July meeting of the Council, the majority of economic sentiment indicators had further improved and GDP growth forecasts for 2010 in the United States and in the euro area had been slightly revised upwards.",
        "At the same time, it was emphasised that the global economic activity had continued at a low level and at present it was difficult to assess whether the easing of recessionary tendencies would prove permanent and what would be the scale of a possible recovery.",
        "Considerable uncertainty about the outlook for the global economy is primarily connected with the next year’s finalising of stimulus programmes which are now significantly contributing to mitigating recessions in major economies.",
        "The unfavourable situation in the labour market, strong rise in savings and decline in consumption in the United States together with further deterioration in euro-area labour market all indicate that the stimulus programmes may have only a limited bearing on reviving private demand.",
        "Another important factor affecting global economic growth will be GDP growth in China.",
        "The assessment of the growth outlook is additionally hindered by persisting problems in the banking sector.",
        "Some members of the Council argued that the above mentioned factors, after a temporary recovery driven by direct effect of stimulus programmes, might bring about another decline in the global economic growth.",
        "In particular, those members argued that the expected recovery in the euro area might not prove long-lived.",
        "In this context, they pointed out that despite certain improvement in the financial markets conditions the majority of commercial banks operating in the euro area continued to tighten their lending policies.",
        "Other Council members assessed that despite considerable uncertainty persisting, the incoming information indicated an improvement in the outlook for the global economic growth, which might suggest that the global recession would be less severe than anticipated.",
        "Those members also pointed out that the growing role of Asian countries in the global economy might contribute to the recovery in the euro area despite weak domestic demand in this economy.",
        "While analysing the inflationary processes abroad, it was pointed out that despite growing commodity prices the decline in overall price level in the United States and in the euro area had  Warszawa Świętokrzy ska  no (22)  51 further deepened, amidst further decrease in positive core inflation indicators.",
        "Some members of the Council argued that these trends indicated that possible global inflationary threats would be probably of a longer-term nature and in the coming quarters major central banks should not be expected to start tightening their monetary policy.",
        "In the opinion of those Council members, the persisting pressure on price decline in the global economy would be, through import prices, curbing inflation in Poland.",
        "Other members of the Council pointed out that due to an unprecedented scale of stimulation measures introduced in the largest economies, the credibility of the so-called exit strategy from the expansionary macroeconomic policy would be of key importance for permanent anchoring of inflationary expectations and, as a result, for stabilising inflation at a low level.",
        "While addressing the situation in Poland, the members of the Council pointed out that the data on the domestic economic climate were ambiguous.",
        "On the one hand, further decline in Polish exports and persisting negative annual growth in industrial output (including the output of intermediate and investment goods), deepening fall in employment in the corporate sector, growing unemployment rate and further decline in bank lending all pointed to the continuation of low activity in the Polish economy.",
        "On the other hand, the majority of economic sentiment indicators rose, which may indicate an improvement in the economic situation in the months to come.",
        "While discussing the outlook for economic growth, it was stressed that it largely depended on economic situation abroad and the related external demand for Polish products.",
        "It was pointed out that factors supporting economic growth in Poland included the continuing, albeit lower than in the previous quarters, consumption growth and a positive contribution of net exports, connected with both the improvement in the price competitiveness of the Polish products in relation to imports driven by the depreciation of the zloty in the second half of 2008 and at the beginning of 2009, and also by the effect of stimulus packages introduced in the major world economies.",
        "In this context it was argued that uncertainty related to GDP growth in Poland included how permanent would be the easing of recessionary tendencies in Poland’s main trading partners and exchange rate developments.",
        "Some Council members pointed out that the zloty appreciation observed over the recent months, through lowering the price competitiveness of Polish products, may be conducive to reducing the contribution of net exports to GDP growth and to extending the slowdown in the Polish economy.",
        "Those Council members argued that the same effect may be brought by the deterioration of labour market situation, including the lowering of the real aggregate wages, which may translate into curbing consumer demand.",
        "It was pointed out that another factor that had a negative impact on GDP growth was the reduction in the supply of bank loans.",
        "At the meeting, the Council also discussed current and expected inflation developments.",
        "It was indicated that the inflation rise in July 2009 to 3.6%, i.e.",
        "above the NBP’s inflation target of 2.5% and slightly above the upper limit for deviations from the target set at 3.5%, was primarily driven by a strong surge in prices of tobacco resulting from changes in the excise tax and by a further increase in fuel prices.",
        "Some Council members argued that despite the fact that inflation could remain at a heightened level in the coming period – mainly due to the relatively high annual growth of food and regulated prices – the available forecasts point to its decline in the second half of 2010, which should be supported by the negative output gap connected with the still weak external and domestic demand, continuing low wage pressure and the previous appreciation of the zloty.",
        "Other Council members emphasised that CPI inflation in Poland is characterised by a relatively high persistence and subsequent projections were extending the horizon of inflation returning to the target, which does not support the anchoring of inflation expectations.",
        "Those members also pointed out that in line with the June projection, in 2010-2011 CPI inflation should be running below core inflation net of food and energy prices, which has not been observed since 2003.",
        "Moreover, some members of the Council argued that the slowing potential output growth combined with the improving outlook for economic growth may cause the negative output gap to close earlier than anticipated.",
        "It was also emphasised that currently both inflation and GDP growth in Poland were significantly higher than in most countries of the European Union.",
        "The Council paid a lot of attention to the exchange rate developments, emphasising the zloty appreciation in the recent period.",
        "Some Council members indicated that the improved sentiment in the world financial markets, relatively favourable economic situation in Poland as compared to other EU countries and the access to a flexible credit line of the International Monetary Fund lowered the risk of strong zloty depreciation.",
        "At the same time, the persistently heightened volatility of the zloty exchange rate was emphasised.",
        "Some members of the Council indicated that one factor affecting the zloty exchange rate could be the disparity of nominal interest rates between Poland and the euro area and the United States favouring – especially amidst stabilising financial market situation – the inflow of capital, which was reflected in the growing share of foreign investors in the market of Polish Treasury securities.",
        "Other Council members, however, assessed that the perspectives of capital inflow to the Central and Eastern European countries were to a greater extent influenced by the sentiment of foreign investors towards the region and by the disparity in real terms, which was significantly lower than that calculated in nominal terms.",
        "While addressing the situation in the banking sector, on the one hand – the further reduction of lending to the corporate sector was emphasised, and on the other – the still stable increases in consumer loans to households.",
        "In this context, some Council members pointed out that banks were increasing their profit margins, which meant that lowering of the costs of newly granted loans was smaller than the scale of the implemented cuts in the NBP interest rates.",
        "In the opinion of those Council members, the monetary policy should account for shifts in profit margins resulting from the business cycle.",
        "Other members of the Council argued that in the current situation the effectiveness of the credit channel was limited, which meant that possible further interest rate cuts would have only minor effect for the supply of credit.",
        "While analysing the situation in the banking sector, the Council also discussed the situation of cooperative banks.",
        "It was emphasised that those banks have a large local significance, among others, due to the preferential loans they offer for investments and development projects in agriculture as well as their contribution to financing local governments.",
        "It was pointed out that cooperative banks were characterised with a surplus of deposits over extended loans and a lower share of irregular loans in their credit portfolios than commercial banks, which gave cooperative banks considerable potential for lending expansion.",
        "However, in the opinion of some Council members, an increase in lending by cooperative banks called for the adoption of measures aimed at raising regulatory capital of this sector.",
        "While discussing interest rates, some members of the Council pointed out that the real ex ante rates, i.e.",
        "rates deflated with expected inflation, remained positive, which combined with the output gap remaining negative, could justify further NBP rate cuts.",
        "Other members of the Council, however, argued that amidst large uncertainty accompanying inflation forecasts and, at the same time, its high persistence, economic agents in their decision making would to a larger extent consider the real ex post interest rates, i.e.",
        "rates deflated with current inflation, which were currently close to zero and could be expected to run at a very low level also in the months to come.",
        "While considering the decision on interest rates, the Council assessed that the uncertainty about the outlook for inflation and economic growth in the world and in Poland justified keeping the rates unchanged at the current meeting.",
        "Some Council members believed that the risk of economic growth continuing at a low level in the longer run combined with the forecasted significant inflation decline in 2010 might justify further easing of the monetary policy in the future.",
        "Moreover, it was argued that the anticipated increase in the deficit of the public finance sector would be primarily the effect of automatic stabilisers rather than anticyclical measures introduced in the fiscal policy, which – in the opinion of those Council members – did not restrict the possibility of further monetary policy easing.",
        "Other members of the Council pointed out that the incoming data suggested that the recession in the world economy and the slowdown of growth in Poland might prove milder than previously expected.",
        "Those members argued that signs of economic recovery justified the assessment that the probabilities of inflation running above or below the inflation target in the medium term were roughly equal, while the NBP’s interest rates should be kept unchanged also in the coming months.",
        "At the meeting, the prevailing view was that the probability of inflation running below the inflation target in the medium term was higher than the probability of inflation running above the target.",
        "The Council kept the interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 3.50%, the lombard rate at 5.00%, the deposit rate at 2.00% and the rediscount rate at 3.75%.",
        "During the meeting the Monetary Policy Council discussed the outlook for inflation in the context of the past, current and, primarily, anticipated economic situation.",
        "The discussion at the meeting focused on the situation in the credit market and in the banking sector as well as on the outlook for economic growth and inflation in Poland and abroad.",
        "The Council paid a lot of attention to the situation in the domestic credit market.",
        "It was pointed to a strong decline in the growth of corporate and mortgage loans.",
        "On the other hand, attention was paid to a still high growth in consumption loans.",
        "It was pointed out banks might give preference to consumer loans market as the average volume of this type of loan is lower and the average maturity shorter, whereas interest rate significantly higher than in the case of other loan categories.",
        "Yet, some members of the Council paid attention to the growing risk of the loan portfolio deterioration related with granted consumption loans and, as a result, possible reduction of lending also in this segment.",
        "It was emphasized that reduction in lending has a negative impact on economic activity in Poland.",
        "It was also pointed at the risk of unfavourable feedback between deteriorating situation in the real economy and situation of the financial sector.",
        "While discussing measures that could support lending growth, the lowering of the required reserve rate was considered.",
        "It was emphasized that lowering of the reserve requirement was one of the expectations stated by banks during the preparation of the Pact on Credit Action Development in Poland.",
        "In the opinion of the Council, the reduction of the required reserve rate should be conducive towards increasing banks' lending.",
        "While analysing the scale of the reduction in reserve requirement, it was pointed out that lowering of this rate should be implemented gradually, and potential further adjustments should depend on the impact of this reduction on bank lending and interest rate developments in the interbank market.",
        "Some members of the Council argued that high credit risk assessment was a more important reason for banks’ limiting their lending than liquidity situation.",
        "In this context it was assessed that implementation of the guarantees and warranties of the Bank Gospodarstwa Krajowego introduced under the governmental Stability and Development Plan would favour the growth of corporate lending.",
        "While discussing the outlook for bank lending in Poland, the capital position of the banking sector was also addressed.",
        "It was pointed out that solvency ratio for the whole banking sector had recently stabilized, yet the capital position of different banks was diverse.",
        "The risk of decline in capital adequacy ratios may – in the case of some banks – reduce their lending.",
        "It was also pointed out that amidst the low limits for interbank transactions – in their attempt to acquire deposits from non-financial sector – banks had offered, for several months now, relatively high interests rate on deposits, considerably exceeding interest rates on loans in the interbank market.",
        "In the opinion of some members of the Council, banks undertake such measures in order to change the structure of their balance sheets to improve the relation between the value of granted  Warszawa ulica Świętokrzyska telefon (22)  55  (22)  51 loans and the value of acquired deposits.",
        "Those members also pointed out that relatively high costs of financing of banks’ activity were coupled with falling yields on previously granted loans whose interest rate was largely based on variable WIBOR 3M rate.",
        "While analyzing the money market interest rate developments, it was pointed at the recent rise in WIBOR 3M rate which occurred amidst NBP interest rates being kept unchanged.",
        "Attention was also paid to the fact that WIBOR 3M rate was now considerably higher than the interest rate on repo transactions with the same maturity.",
        "According to some members of the Council, decline in banks’ income on granted loans being the result of falling interest rates in the interbank market accompanied by high costs of acquiring deposits induces those banks to undertake measures aimed at maintaining WIBOR 3M rate at a heightened level, while limiting their interbank transactions.",
        "While discussing the external environment of the Polish economy, it was pointed to the signs of easing of downward trends in the global economy.",
        "At the same time, it was emphasised that the uncertainty about the starting point and sustainability of a possible recovery in the world economy remains high.",
        "In this context, attention was paid to the data suggesting stabilization of economic activity in the United States, while, at the same time, it was pointed out that some recently released data on American economy was worse than expected.",
        "While analysing the outlook for economic growth in Poland’s major trading partners, it was assessed that due to relatively lower flexibility of product and labour markets, the recession in Western Europe might be longer than in the United States.",
        "It was emphasized that a strong drop in GDP growth in euro area economies in 2009 Q1 might suggest that decline in economic activity in this region in 2009 – despite recent improvement in some economic indicators – would be deeper than expected.",
        "Some members of the Council also indicated that good economic situation in Western European economies in the past few years was largely driven by the boom in real estate markets and high demand for investment goods in the world.",
        "Those members argued that amidst current slump in real estate markets the recovery might take relatively long time both in the countries where the real estate bubble had burst and in the countries which had not reported any significant disequilibrium in these markets but whose exports were largely dependent upon high demand in the global economy.",
        "At the same time, those members pointed out that persisting low level of production capacity utilization in Western European economies might lead to a decline in the inflow of foreign direct investment to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, including Poland, which might negatively affect productivity and economic growth in this region.",
        "While analysing the situation in the Polish economy, it was indicated that the released data suggested a possibility of GDP growth remaining positive in 2009 Q1.",
        "At the same time, it was assessed that subsequent quarters would see a downward trend in GDP growth which was suggested by macroeconomic data for April 2009 and economic indicators remaining at a low level despite a certain improvement in recent period.",
        "Some members of the Council assessed that GDP would probably grow in 2009, albeit the risk of its slight decline could not be excluded.",
        "Moreover, other members of the Council assessed that recovery in the Polish economy might come later than expected and the GDP growth might remain at a relatively low level for a longer period of time, should the recession in Poland’s major trading partners prove long-lasting.",
        "In the opinion of some members of the Council factors curbing the decline in GDP growth in subsequent quarters might include – similarly to 2009 Q1 – consumption and net exports.",
        "It was pointed out that consumption growth slowed down gradually due to still relatively high wage growth, income tax cuts implemented in 2009 and continuation of relatively high growth in consumption loans.",
        "On the other hand, it was emphasized that growing unemployment and anticipated decline in wage growth as well as worse consumer sentiment - despite certain recent improvement – as compared with the previous years constituted factors that might be conducive to limiting future consumption demand.",
        "Moreover, some members of the Council pointed to the risk of decline in real wages in the economy which might lead to further reduction in consumption.",
        "While addressing investment in the Polish economy, it was pointed out that further decline in private investment would be driven by unfavourable outlook for economic growth in Poland and abroad amidst production capacity surplus connected with high level of investment in the previous years.",
        "It was also emphasized that factors acting towards decline in investment expenditure would in addition include limited possibility of financing private investment in Poland caused by falling inflow of foreign direct investment, reduced bank lending and deteriorating financial condition of enterprises.",
        "On the other hand, it was pointed out that investment decline in the Polish economy might be curbed by investment projects co-financed with EU funds.",
        "While analysing current inflation developments, it was indicated that in April 2009 inflation exceeded expectations and remained above the upper limit for deviations from the inflation target.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that the rise in inflation in that month was caused by rising food prices, regulated prices and traded goods prices which was driven by the previous zloty exchange rate depreciation.",
        "Some members of the Council emphasized that developments of consumer price index net of prices largely beyond the direct control of monetary policy signalled that inflationary pressure in Poland had not eased considerably yet.",
        "While discussing the outlook for inflation in Poland, some members of the Council pointed out that short-term forecasts of the NBP suggested inflation might decline in the coming months below the upper limit for deviations from the inflation target.",
        "Those members also pointed out that the structure of inflation expectations had not deteriorated despite the rise in current inflation.",
        "In the opinion of those members of the Council in the medium term decline in inflation should be driven by the slowdown in economic growth and further widening of the negative output gap in Poland.",
        "Other members of the Council also pointed out that at the initial stage of recovery in the Polish economy inflationary pressure should not increase considerably due to faster labour productivity than wage growth and, consequently, favourable changes in unit labour costs.",
        "Some members of the Council also argued that amidst persisting considerable negative output gap inflation in Western European countries might run, for a longer time, at a low level, which – through import prices – would be conducive to easing inflationary pressure in Poland.",
        "Yet, some members of the Council pointed at the risk of growth in agricultural and energy commodity prices in the case of revival of economic activity in the United States and China, likely to occur earlier than in Europe.",
        "Those members argued that continuing relatively low growth in the Polish economy connected with persisting recession observed in Poland’s major trading partners might be then accompanied by inflationary pressure resulting from increase in commodity prices in the global markets.",
        "At the meeting, it was also pointed out that the rise in inflation in the medium term might in addition be driven by a possible rise in indirect and local taxes as well as fees and prices regulated by local governments, connected with considerable deterioration in the situation of the general government sector.",
        "At the same time, some members of the Council pointed at high uncertainty about future tax policy of central government and about taxes, fees and prices decided by local authorities.",
        "While discussing the impact of exchange rate on inflation, some members of the Council assessed that exchange rate developments remained the main risk factor for price stability.",
        "Those members also argued that – in the absence of current inflation growth translating into rising inflationary expectations and assuming exchange rate stabilization in the future – the impact of exchange rate depreciation on inflation might be expected to fade off gradually.",
        "Other members of the Council pointed out, however, that the pass-through of the previous exchange rate developments on inflation might be stronger than assessed earlier.",
        "Moreover, some members of the Council argued that the risk of deterioration in the outlook for growth in the Polish economy as a result of longer-than-expected slowdown in the economic activity in the euro area and a fall in the inflow of direct investment might be conducive to zloty exchange rate depreciation in the medium term.",
        "Those members also pointed out that the risk of exchange rate depreciation might result from deteriorating situation in the general government sector in Poland.",
        "Deteriorating fiscal situation increases uncertainty about the moment of zloty entering the ERM II.",
        "At the meeting the prospects of Poland meeting the Maastricht price stability criterion were also addressed.",
        "It was indicated that 12-month moving average HICP inflation in Poland exceeded in April 2009 by 0.7 percentage point the reference value for price stability criterion and that the difference between those indicators increased considerably.",
        "Members of the Council agreed that current inflation developments, uncertainty about the prospects of economic recovery in Poland and abroad and uncertainty about the situation in the public finance and its impact on inflation justified keeping the NBP interest rates unchanged at the current meeting.",
        "Some members of the Council indicated also that also very low level of real interest rates spoke in favour of leaving the NBP interest rates unchanged.",
        "The majority of the Council members decided that a more comprehensive assessment of the medium-term outlook for inflation would be possible after getting acquainted with the results of the June projection of inflation and GDP.",
        "Moreover, the Council decided that strong contraction in lending justified lowering the required reserve rate by 50 basis points at the current meeting.",
        "A motion to lower the required reserve rate by 50 basis points was put forward and passed.",
        "The Council lowered the required reserve rate from 3.5% to 3%, keeping, at the same time, the interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 3.75%, the lombard rate at 5.25%, the deposit rate at 2.25% and the rediscount rate at 4.00%.",
        "During the meeting the Monetary Policy Council discussed the outlook for inflation in the context of the past, current and, primarily, anticipated economic situation.",
        "The discussion at the meeting focused on the outlook for economic growth abroad and in Poland, medium-term inflation outlook, fiscal policy and credit market conditions.",
        "The Council devoted a lot of attention to the outlook for global economic growth, while at the same time pointing out the considerable uncertainty surrounding the activity in the world economy both in the near future and in the longer term.",
        "It was emphasised that in the light of some data, including in particular those on the United States and China, recessionary tendencies in the world economy might have been halted in 2009 Q2, which is to a large extent connected with the fiscal and monetary stimulus programmes being implemented in many countries.",
        "Some Council members assessed that those programmes may be conducive to a recovery of global economic growth in 2010.",
        "They argued that accelerated economic growth in China may have an effect of reviving the activity in other Asian economies and – through increasing trade, which would also include raising those countries’ demand for imported investment goods – lead to an economic recovery in the euro area and the United States.",
        "Other members of the Council, however, believed that the incoming information was rather ambiguous and that on the basis of data signalling a strong increase in savings accompanied with a drop in household consumption in the United States and also a further deterioration in the euro-area labour market in 2009 Q2, it was difficult to expect any marked rise in global economic activity in the near term.",
        "Moreover, they argued that with the end of the stimulus programmes implemented in the United States and many other countries the activity in these economies may slacken again, which may be connected with government expenditures being trimmed to curb budget deficits and limited spending of indebted households.",
        "While addressing the long-term outlook for the world economic growth, some Council members argued that the global financial crisis may negatively affect the potential GDP growth in many countries.",
        "This may be driven by the steep decrease in world trade and international capital flows, in particular foreign direct investment, the breakdown of a part of the financial sector and the ensuing reduced access of economic agents to credit and also by the relatively persistent rise in unemployment.",
        "In the opinion of those Council members, the high level of uncertainty as to the impact of the financial crisis on economies in the longer term significantly hinders the assessment of the future economic growth and inflationary pressure in the world and in Poland, especially with the use of econometric models which are based on historical data.",
        "While addressing the situation in the domestic economy, it was pointed out that some positive signals regarding the economic activity appeared recently.",
        "It was assessed that the deceleration of recessionary tendencies in Poland may be indicated by the slower decline of industrial output, an improvement in some business confidence indicators and the fact that part of the data for June proved better than expected.",
        "Some Council members assessed that the GDP growth in 2009 Q2 may have been positive and slightly higher than expected in the June projection, which raised the probability of above-zero GDP growth in the whole of 2009.",
        "Other Council members, however, emphasised that in the light of the June NBP projection the GDP growth would be lower than the potential output growth in the monetary policy transmission horizon.",
        "Those members assessed that in the time to come recession abroad would continue to negatively affect the activity in the Polish economy, in particular through the low demand for Polish export products and a drop in foreign direct investment conducive to lowering labour productivity.",
        "They emphasised that the rise in unemployment, declining growth of real wages and the drop in the value of households’ assets observed till 2009 Q1 would be contributing to further reduction in consumption demand in the coming quarters.",
        "They also argued that the prospects for investment growth in the enterprise sector remained negative, among others, due to the pessimistic – despite some improvement – sentiment of entrepreneurs, hindered access to credit and possible further tightening of banks’ credit policies and also deteriorating corporate profits.",
        "In the assessment of some Council members, economic growth in Poland may run below the central path of the June projection of the NBP, among others, due to the possibly lower economic activity abroad than accounted for in the projection, weaker than projected investment growth connected with the negative business sentiment and a stronger increase in unemployment along with the ensuing drop in households’ disposable income.",
        "Those members also argued that the recently observed appreciation of the zloty would be conducive to reducing net exports and, consequently, to lowering GDP growth.",
        "At the meeting the Council also discussed the fiscal policy and its impact on the outlook for economic growth in Poland.",
        "It was pointed out that in the light of the draft amendment of the Budget Act for the Year 2009 passed by the lower chamber of the Parliament the drop in tax revenue in 2009 would be significantly deeper than the scale of the assumed increase in the central budget deficit.",
        "In the opinion of some members of the Council, with a persisting structural deficit of the general government, part of lost tax revenue would be compensated by ad hoc measures aimed at increasing non-tax revenue or cutting or postponing budget expenditure.",
        "In the assessment of those Council members, such measures would be conducive to a one-off reduction of the central budget deficit in 2009, but at the same time to its increase in the following years.",
        "This creates the risk for the public debt to breach the so-called prudential thresholds provided for in the Public Finance Act and also the limit set forth in the Constitution, which would necessitate a strong fiscal tightening and would have a procyclical effect of undercutting domestic demand and slowing GDP growth.",
        "Moreover, in the assessment of those Council members, the shifting of some central budget expenditures to other general government units, which was assumed in the discussed bill, led to reducing the transparency of the public finance and increasing the uncertainty as to the actual scale of fiscal imbalance in Poland.",
        "In this context it was emphasised that there was a need of implementing structural reforms, including the public finance reform, in Poland in the longer run, which would favour a permanent increase in economic growth.",
        "While discussing current inflation it was pointed out that the CPI inflation in June declined to the upper limit for deviations from the inflation target of the NBP (i.e.",
        "to 3.5%), which was primarily the effect of a stronger than a year before seasonal drop in the food price growth and slower growth of prices of energy carriers resulting mostly from the base effect.",
        "Some members of the Council emphasised that June also saw a reduction in core inflation net of food and energy prices, which in 2009 Q2 as a whole proved slightly lower than forecast in the June inflation projection.",
        "Other Council members stressed that in the past few quarters core inflation remained at an elevated level and did not fall significantly despite a strong deceleration of economic growth, which pointed at the persistence of inflationary processes.",
        "In particular, the prices of some market services have been rising over the recent months, which in the opinion of those Council members might indicate a persisting demand pressure in some sectors of the economy.",
        "Moreover, those Council members pointed out that – despite a decline in June – the CPI inflation in the whole of 2009 Q2 proved markedly higher than in the June projection.",
        "In this context it was pointed out that the ex post real interest rates (deflated with current inflation) in Poland were close to zero.",
        "While analysing the medium-term inflation outlook, some Council members assessed that – in line with the June projection – inflation in the monetary policy transmission horizon would fall below the inflation target, which would be driven with the negative output gap and easing wage pressure.",
        "At the same time, some Council members assessed that inflation in the medium term could be lower than envisaged by the central projection path due to lower growth of unit labour costs, which could result from a deeper drop in wage growth than that accounted for in the projection.",
        "Moreover, in the conditions of low demand the impact of ULC growth on inflation may be limited.",
        "Another factor mentioned as potentially conducive to lower inflation in the time to come was the significant appreciation of zloty exchange rate observed over the past few months.",
        "Other Council members assessed that inflation in the coming quarters may be running above the central projection path, among others, due to the risk of higher commodity and food prices than in the projection and the continuing high demand for some services resulting from the structural changes ongoing in the Polish economy and increasing the prices of those services.",
        "Those members also pointed out that in line with the June projection, in 2010-2011 CPI inflation should be running below core inflation net of food and energy prices, which has not been observed since 2003.",
        "They also argued that, due to the difficult revenue situation of the general government sector, the coming period may bring further increases of administered prices, which would postpone the decline in inflation.",
        "On the other hand, however, they emphasised that an elevated inflation level in the time to come would mainly follow from the previously implemented and possible further increases of administered prices and only to a small extent from the continuing demand pressure.",
        "The Council discussed the credit market situation and interest rate developments in Poland.",
        "It was pointed out that, despite the NBP interest rate cuts, in June 2009 the interest charged on some newly granted loans increased, which in combination with the concurrent decline in the interest paid on some new deposits pointed to increased interest margins of banks.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members, the imperfect pass-through of the reference rate to the interest rate charged on new loans was an argument against further cuts of NBP rates.",
        "Other Council members argued that the so far effected NBP interest rate cuts had, in the longer perspective, contributed to lowering the interest on loans and that the reduction in lending along with increased interest margins were related to the growing credit risk, particularly in the case of loans granted to corporates.",
        "The Council also analysed the impact of the NBP’s interest rates on long-term interest rates.",
        "While considering the decision on interest rates, the Council assessed that the uncertainty about the outlook for inflation and economic growth in the world and in Poland justified keeping the rates unchanged at the current meeting.",
        "Some members of the Council believed that in view of the low level of real interest rates, the continuously elevated current inflation level and balanced – in their assessment – probabilities of inflation running above or below the inflation target in the medium term, the NBP interest rates should be kept unchanged also in the months to come.",
        "Other Council members assessed that inflation would drop below the NBP inflation target in the medium term, which combined with the risk of a stronger than expected decline in economic growth may justify the continuation of monetary policy easing in the future.",
        "The prevailing view at the meeting was that the probability of inflation running below the inflation target in the medium term was higher than the probability of inflation running above the target.",
        "The Council kept the interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 3.50%, the lombard rate at 5.00%, the deposit rate at 2.00% and the rediscount rate at 3.75%.",
        "During the meeting the Monetary Policy Council discussed the outlook for inflation in the context of the past, current and, primarily, anticipated economic situation.",
        "The discussion at the meeting focused on the short-term interest rate developments in the context of conducted open market operations, zloty exchange rate changes, outlook for inflation and economic growth in Poland and situation in the banking sector.",
        "The Council paid a lot of attention to the consequences of change introduced to conducting open market operations by limiting the supply of NBP bills.",
        "This change resulted in higher liquidity remaining in the banking sector and related reduction in short-term interest rates in the interbank market significantly below the NBP reference rate.",
        "It was argued that limiting the supply of NBP bills as compared to the demand is aimed at fostering activity of commercial banks in the interbank market.",
        "In the opinion of some discussants, lack of possibility of investing all the banks’ liquid assets in money bills should further result in this liquidity being used to increase lending.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that limited supply of NBP bills translated into banks’ increased interest in investing in Treasury bills.",
        "Some members of the Council argued that changes introduced to conducting open market operations, translating into short-term interest rates in the interbank market lowering below the NBP reference rate should be taken into account in the Council’s decisions concerning both the level of the NBP interest rates and the possible further changes in the monetary policy instruments used.",
        "At the same time, they pointed out that increased liquidity in the interbank market might impede exchange rate stabilization.",
        "Moreover, the Council decided that reduction of reserve requirement rate and decrease of the deposit rate by more that other NBP interest rates were not justified at the moment.",
        "The Council also discussed the possible change in interest rates on FX swaps used by the NBP and extension of their maturity.",
        "While addressing the exchange rate issues, it was pointed out that since the February meeting of the Council, the previously observed depreciation of the zloty had been halted.",
        "Some members of the Council emphasized that the role of interest rate disparity was temporarily limited, and exchange rate developments continued to be largely affected by other, mainly global and regional factors, which was indicated by similar changes in exchange rates of the currencies of Central and Eastern Europe.",
        "Other members of the Council argued that foreign exchange market is still marked by high volatility and that the Council should continue to take into account the risk of further depreciation of the zloty.",
        "In this context the importance of macroeconomic situation in other economies of the region and the impact of any negative developments in those countries on the zloty exchange rate were emphasized.",
        "In the opinion of those Council members, a major factor behind uncertainty concerning zloty exchange rate developments was prospects of Poland’s accession to the euro area.",
        "While discussing the exchange rate, it was stressed that the previously observed considerable zloty depreciation was the main risk factor for price stability in the coming months.",
        "It was pointed out that the weakening of the zloty, through a strong increase in fuel prices, contributed largely to a rise  Warszawa ulica Świętokrzyska telefon (22)  55  (22)  51 in inflation in February as compared to January 2009.",
        "Yet, at the same time, some Council members stressed that the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on inflation would probably be short-lived, and translation of the depreciation into domestic prices might be limited amidst economic slowdown.",
        "Other members of the Council argued that a rise in producer prices in February which proved considerably higher than expected, might be largely connected with the previously observed weakening of the zloty exchange rate.",
        "In the opinion of those Council members, although rising producer prices did not automatically translate into consumer prices, in the situation of weakening external demand, rising production costs might be compensated for by price increases in the domestic market, thus contributing to higher inflation.",
        "Those members also pointed out that any further weakening of the zloty might lead to the fading of the anti-inflationary effect connected with lower imported inflation.",
        "It was emphasized that, apart from the previously observed considerable depreciation of the zloty exchange rate, higher inflation was driven mainly by rising administered prices, including, in particular, flat maintenance and energy prices.",
        "Some Council members argued that the coming months might be expected to see those prices continue to growth at an increased rate which would reduce a fall in inflation.",
        "It was also pointed out that food price developments resulting from unfavourable occurrences in the regions being important suppliers of main agricultural products, were a risk factor for inflation.",
        "While addressing other factors affecting the outlook for inflation, some members of the Council pointed out that deepening recession in the global economy putting a downward pressure on inflation abroad and a relatively low level of prices of raw materials – below the level accounted for in the NBP February projection – would curb inflation in Poland.",
        "They also argued that amidst weakening external and domestic demand, falling demand for labour would cause faster that accounted for in the February inflation projection decline in wage growth which would be conducive to a reduction of growth in unit labour costs.",
        "Those Council members assessed that the above mentioned factors connected with strong decline in the demand pressure in the economy indicated faster decrease in inflation than accounted for in the projection, which is also suggested by the results of short-term forecasts prepared by the NBP.",
        "While assessing the outlook for economic growth abroad, attention was paid to deepening recession in the United States and in the euro area as well as to further lowering of forecasts for those economies and the related risk of global recession lasting longer than accounted for in the February projection.",
        "It was emphasized that in response to the strong decline in economic activity and risks to stability of the financial sector, major central banks lowered their interest rates to very low levels and undertook actions aimed directly at increasing the supply of reserve money which were intended to intensify lending and decrease long-term interest rates.",
        "Attention was also paid to the fact that no further interest rate cuts were implemented by central banks of Central and Eastern Europe.",
        "While discussing the domestic economic growth, it was pointed out that recession in Poland’s main trading partners translated into decreasing exports and industrial output which was corroborated by the data for the first months of 2009.",
        "It was argued that weakening demand in the economy was leading to falling employment in the corporate sector, rising unemployment and declining wage growth.",
        "At the same time it was emphasized that deteriorating situation in the labour market was curbing consumer demand which was reflected by retail sales data.",
        "It was also indicated that deteriorating financial situation of enterprises was hindering their investment activity.",
        "According to some members of the Council, the above mentioned factors, namely reduced external and domestic demand (both consumer and investment demand) would result in GDP growth being considerably lower than accounted for in the February projection.",
        "Other Council members emphasized that the risk of further zloty depreciation was also of considerable importance for the outlook of economic growth, since through increase in the value of obligations denominated in foreign currencies and the related rise in debt service costs it might also lead to further deterioration in financial situation of households and enterprises leading to lower GDP.",
        "While analyzing the situation in the banking sector, attention was paid to high liquidity preference of banks and their striving to attract deposits of non-financial sector by offering still high interest rates.",
        "It was pointed out that high costs of financing bank activity resulting from the above were reflected in increased margins on newly granted credits.",
        "At the same time, however, it was emphasized that in the first few months of 2009 reduction in interests rates on deposits and loans, following a considerable lowering of the NBP interest rates, was observed.",
        "Some discussants argued that NBP interest rate cuts should lead to further fall in interest rates on deposits thus reducing the costs of banks’ financing and contributing to a reduction in interest rates on loans.",
        "Yet, it was pointed out that considerable increase in banks’ margins was largely due to higher credit risk and, consequently, no considerable reduction in margins should be expected.",
        "Some members of the Council emphasized that even if NBP interest rates reductions were not fully reflected in interest rates on newly granted loans in commercial banks, lower interest rates decreased the costs of servicing already taken loans which was of considerable importance for the financial condition of some households and enterprises.",
        "Other Council members pointed out that the impact of further interest rate cuts on the development of bank lending was currently limited since the volume of loans depended, to a major extent, on factors not directly linked to the NBP interest rates (such as high liquidity preference and high credit risk assessment).",
        "The Council discussed the prospects of Poland’s accession to the euro area and related requirement to fulfill the convergence criteria, including, in particular, price stability criterion.",
        "While considering the decision on interest rates, some members of the Council argued that considerable decline in economic activity leading to significant reduction in demand, combined with lower wage pressure, and consequently also inflationary pressure, justified further lowering of the interest rates.",
        "The reduction of the NBP interest rates should – in their opinion – translate into lower interest rates on deposits and loans in commercial banks contributing to intensified lending and preventing excessive decline in economic activity.",
        "Other Council members argued, however, that the decision on interest rates should take into account the lowering of the short-term interest rates in the interbank market significantly below the NBP reference rate driven by changes introduced to the conducting of open market operations.",
        "They also pointed at the risk of further zloty depreciation and at a decline of real interest rate.",
        "A motion to lower the NBP interest rates by 25 basis points was put forward and passed.",
        "The Council decided to lower the NBP interest rates to the level: the reference rate to 3.75%, the lombard rate to 5.25%, the deposit rate to 2.25% and the rediscount rate to 4.00%.",
        "During the meeting the Monetary Policy Council discussed the outlook for inflation in the context of the past, current and, primarily, anticipated economic situation.",
        "The discussion at the meeting focused on the outlook for economic growth and inflation abroad and in Poland, zloty exchange rate developments and credit market conditions.",
        "The Council paid a lot of attention to the domestic economic growth.",
        "It was pointed out that the recession in the external environment of the Polish economy and the accompanying decline in foreign demand for Polish goods had increasing impact on the activity in the domestic economy which is corroborated, among other things, by further fall in industrial output in December.",
        "Considerable reduction in demand, in particular for the products of exporting enterprises, is also signalled by the results of the NBP business climate surveys.",
        "It was emphasized that deteriorating outlook for sales translated into investment dampening and, consequently, contributed to faster than previously expected slowdown in GDP growth.",
        "While discussing the outlook for economic growth in Poland it was noted that it was largely dependent on the foreign economic situation.",
        "In this context, the deepening recession in the United States and in the euro area was pointed out together with a risk of further downward revisions of economic growth forecasts for Poland’s main trading partners.",
        "The risk is related to the negative impact of the global financial crisis on the situation in the labour markets in those countries and, consequently, on households’ income and consumption.",
        "The protracted recession in the external environment of the Polish economy may delay the improvement in the domestic business activity relative to previous assessments.",
        "Some members of the Council emphasized that this might translate into even stronger curbing of the investment activity of enterprises; consequently, the contribution of investment to GDP growth in 2009 might be negative.",
        "It was argued that economic slowdown in Poland, through decreasing labour demand and declining wage growth, would contribute to limiting households’ consumption growth.",
        "Another factor curbing domestic demand may be a reduction in general government expenditure, which – if concerning investment outlays – will additionally negatively affect GDP growth in the longer term.",
        "Some members of the Council argued that implementation of projects financed with EU funds by local government entities would contribute to maintaining the growth of the general government investment expenditures.",
        "While discussing inflation developments, attention was paid to the slightly stronger than expected decline in inflation in December 2008 to 3.3%, i.e.",
        "below the upper limit for deviations from the NBP’s inflation target.",
        "It was indicated that the decrease in inflation had been largely driven by falling fuel prices, yet, it was emphasized that core inflation had also declined.",
        "While addressing the outlook for inflation, it was assessed that in the coming months inflation should gradually decline to the inflation target (2.5%).",
        "At the same time, some members of the Council emphasized that considerable depreciation of the zloty exchange rate observed in the past few months and possible further raises in administered prices would be factors conducive to price increases.",
        "In this context, attention was paid, among other things, to possible increases in 2009 of excise tax on fuels aimed at compensating some of the decline in government budget revenues,  Warszawa ulica Świętokrzyska telefon (22)  55  (22)  51 which would translate into higher prices.",
        "Other members of the Council argued that the pass through of exchange rate changes into inflation might be limited amidst economic slowdown, and raises in administered prices are beyond the direct impact of monetary policy.",
        "Those members also emphasized that rises in administered prices limited households’ purchasing power, which in an economic downturn would additionally curb their demand.",
        "During the discussion attention was also paid to uncertainty relating to changes in inflation in the near term connected with commodity price developments in the global markets and with the GUS changing the weights in the households’ consumption basket.",
        "The majority of the Council members stressed that amidst declining inflationary pressure, monetary policy should focus more on counteracting excessive slowdown of economic growth, thus contributing to maintaining price stability in the medium term.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members, this justified a significant reduction of the NBP interest rates so that – considering the time lags in the transmission mechanism – the effects of such measures could translate, as soon as possible, into strengthening the domestic demand.",
        "Some Council members were of the opinion that the easing of the monetary policy should also be accompanied by the implementation of the government loan guarantee system supporting economic growth.",
        "While discussing the exchange rate developments, it was emphasized that the recently observed considerable depreciation of the zloty exchange rate resulted mainly from the increase in risk aversion in the global financial markets leading to capital outflow from the emerging markets, which was reflected in a rise of bond yields and CDS rates.",
        "Some Council members pointed out that the scale of zloty depreciation was higher than that of other currencies of the Central and Eastern Europe despite interest rates in Poland had been lowered to a lesser extent than in other countries of the region.",
        "In their opinion, this meant that the impact of the interest rate disparity on the exchange rate had recently been limited.",
        "At the same time, those Council members indicated that under current circumstances the outlook for economic growth in Poland and the resulting situation of the public finance sector were of higher importance for the zloty exchange rate developments.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members, a strong reduction of interest rates aimed at counteracting excessive economic slowdown might therefore contribute to the strengthening of the zloty exchange rate in the medium term.",
        "Additionally, they argued that consolidating lowering the NBP interest rates to the level consistent with both maintaining price stability and supporting economic activity, would be conducive to fading of expectations for further NBP interest rates reductions, which should limit the pressure for zloty depreciation.",
        "Other members of the Council assessed, however, that too strong lowering of the NBP interest rates might boost expectations of financial market participants as to overall scale of further interest rates reductions.",
        "Moreover, they pointed out that the too rapid easing of the monetary policy by the Council might be perceived as a sign of considerable deterioration in the outlook for Polish economy, and thus contribute to further depreciation of the zloty exchange rate.",
        "Those Council members also emphasized that the domestic foreign exchange market was at present relatively shallow bringing about the risk of further strong zloty depreciation which should be accounted for while deciding on the scale of the NBP interest rates reduction.",
        "While analyzing the factors affecting exchange rate developments specific for the Polish economy, some members of the Council argued that the zloty depreciation might have been strengthened by Polish enterprises having to conclude previously signed options contracts by purchasing foreign currency at the market.",
        "On the other hand, some Council members pointed out that declarations of the Government about its commitment to meet the timetable of Poland’s euro area accession could have contributed to limiting the scale of zloty depreciation.",
        "In this context, it was noted that a possible postponement of euro adoption might have a negative impact on zloty exchange rate developments.",
        "While discussing the impact of zloty depreciation on the economy it was indicated that exchange rate depreciation negatively affected the financial condition of enterprises engaged in options contracts and increased the zloty value of debt of economic entities (enterprises, households and public finance sector) denominated in foreign currencies, which would be conducive to curbing their expenditures.",
        "Moreover, it was pointed out that rising import prices driven by weaker exchange rate would – through higher costs of imported commodities and intermediate goods – negatively affect the economic activity in Poland.",
        "On the other hand, it was noted that improved competitiveness of Polish products on foreign markets, related to zloty depreciation, would limit the negative impact of recession in the external environment on Polish exports.",
        "It was argued that depreciation would also lead to rising zloty value of EU funds which – combined with a possible fall in prices of construction and assembly works, signaled by the results of the GUS business condition surveys – might constitute a factor supporting the implementation of investment projects financed with EU funds.",
        "It was emphasized that depreciation bringing about a rise in the prices of imported goods, would favour the growth of domestic demand for domestic goods to the detriment of imported goods which would contribute to reducing the imbalance of Polish trade.",
        "While analyzing the credit market situation it was pointed out that although monetary data had not as yet signaled strong slowdown in credit growth, in 2008 Q4 banks considerably tightened their lending policy and some of them retreated from granting housing loans denominated in foreign currencies.",
        "In this context, some Council members argued that decisions about lowering the NBP interest rates were of considerable importance for bank lending as they contributed to decreasing the costs of zloty denominated loans.",
        "It was also pointed out that since the beginning of the process of the NBP interest rates lowering in November 2008, the 3-month WIBOR rate decreased by more than 100 basis points which confirmed that despite market interest rates remaining at an elevated level relative to the reference rate, the Council’s decisions had a considerable impact on market interest rates.",
        "While analyzing the situation in the banking sector it was pointed out that offering high interest rates on term deposits was accompanied by rising loan margins by banks.",
        "Some Council members argued that by the time the previously opened deposits terminate, banks might tend to maintain the cost of newly granted loans at an increased level even despite reduction in the NBP interest rates.",
        "Moreover, in the opinion of those Council members too deep lowering of the interest rates through decreasing banks’ incomes from servicing previously granted loans – provided their interest depends directly on interest rates in the interbank market – might result in deteriorating financial results of banks and, consequently, constitute a factor limiting lending.",
        "Those members argued that easing the monetary policy should be implemented in such a pace as to allow banks to gradually adjust to changing business conditions.",
        "While discussing the level of interest rates it was pointed out that considering the rapid downturn in the economy and decline in inflationary pressure many central banks had recently continued to ease their monetary policy.",
        "Some members of the Council argued that provided there were no or small reductions in the interest rates in Poland, this would lead to a rise in interest rate disparity.",
        "Other Council members noted, however, that at present it was difficult to assess the impact of the considerable monetary policy easing introduced by major central banks on the economy and financial system stability; therefore, changes in interest rates in other countries should not be followed automatically.",
        "While discussing the decision on interest rates, the Council assessed that the signs of stronger and faster than expected slowdown in the global and Polish economic activity combined with further decline in inflationary pressure spoke of lowering the NBP interest rates.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members reduction of the interest rates should be implemented gradually and its scale at the January meeting should be smaller than in December 2008, especially in view of the easing of the monetary conditions resulting from considerable depreciation of the zloty exchange rate.",
        "According to those members of the Council, too strong lowering of the NBP interest rates at the current meeting posed a risk of further depreciation of the exchange rate which favoured gradual adjustment of interest rates.",
        "Moreover, those members pointed out that too strong lowering of interest rates at the current meeting might excessively boost market expectations as to the total scale of interest rate reduction.",
        "Other members of the Council emphasized, however, that in view of the fast deteriorating outlook for domestic economic growth, it was necessary to lower, as soon as possible, the interest rates to the level supporting the economic activity in Poland.",
        "In the opinion of those Council members considerable reduction of the NBP interest rates would counteract limiting of banks’ lending, and consequently, too strong decline in domestic demand.",
        "They argued that the Council’s decisions aimed at supporting GDP growth in view of the falling inflationary pressure might lead to strengthening of the zloty exchange rate.",
        "The Council also discussed the scale of possible further lowering of the NBP interest rates.",
        "Motions to lower the NBP interest rates by 25 basis point, by 50 basis points and by 75 basis points were put forward.",
        "The motion to lower the NBP interest rates by 75 basis points was passed, therefore the motions to lower the NBP interest rates by 25 basis points and by 50 basis points were not put to voting.",
        "The Council decided to lower the NBP interest rates to the level: the reference rate to 4.25%, the lombard rate to 5.75%, the deposit rate to 2.75% and the rediscount rate to 4.50%."

        "In turn, in the United States, the Federal Reserve began reducing its balance sheet, although – as it was stressed – the scale of monetary expansion was being reduced gradually.",
        "While discussing developments in Poland's real economy, the Council members judged that GDP growth in 2017 Q3 was probably higher than in the previous quarter.",
        "It was emphasised that economic growth was still driven primarily by increasing consumer demand, supported by rising employment and wages, disbursement of benefits and very good consumer sentiment.",
        "It was underlined that the faster construction and assembly output growth than in the first half of the year pointed to a probable recovery in investment.",
        "However, certain Council members pointed out that information incoming in the last month – including data on industrial output, construction and assembly output, and the PMI – was somewhat worse than earlier readings.",
        "It was indicated that – in accordance with the November projection – in 2018 the favourable economic conditions were expected to continue, although GDP growth would probably slow down.",
        "It was underlined that the expected weakening in economic activity in the euro area, including in Germany, would result in some slowdown in economic growth.",
        "The gradual fading of the statistical effects of the \"Family 500 plus\" programme would also dampen GDP growth.",
        "At the same time, the recovery in both public and corporate investment should support GDP growth next year.",
        "However, certain Council members assessed that the scale of the recovery in investment in 2018 – particularly corporate investment – was subject to significant uncertainty.",
        "Moreover, it was pointed out that even with the expected investment growth, the investment rate in the economy would remain relatively low.",
        "However, other Council members were of the opinion that the increasing scale of child benefit payments along with the rising birth rate, the improvement in the financial situation of some consumers due to the lowering of the statutory retirement age, and in 2019 also the possible increase in social benefits and wages in the budget sector, could boost GDP growth.",
        "With reference to labour market conditions, attention was drawn to the gradual growth in employment and fall in unemployment.",
        "It was underlined that this was accompanied by higher wage growth in enterprises and faster rise in unit labour costs than in the previous quarters.",
        "While certain Council members drew attention to the high growth in the wage bill in enterprises, other Council members underlined that in September wage growth in the corporate sector had slowed down somewhat.",
        "It was judged that the inflow of foreign employees to Poland as well as higher labour force participation among Poles continued to contain wage growth.",
        "It was pointed out that in the coming years wage growth and unit labour cost growth – according to the November projection – would increase slightly.",
        "At the same time, some Council members stressed that there was still uncertainty about the impact of the lowering of the statutory retirement age on labour supply and wage pressure, although – according to certain of these members – the scale of this impact would be reduced by the high proportion of non-working persons among those retiring.",
        "Certain Council members expressed the opinion that the low propensity of firms to increase wages amid high competition and a fall in profitability in the recent period could contain wage growth in the coming quarters.",
        "However, other Council members pointed out that a possible restriction to the inflow of foreign employees and a likely increase in wage pressure in the budget sector could lead to faster than expected wage growth.",
        "When analysing price developments in Poland, it was pointed out that the annual consumer price growth remained moderate.",
        "Some Council members underlined that in October annual inflation had decreased somewhat.",
        "These Council members stressed that price growth was currently driven up by the rise in oil and food prices, thus the factors beyond the direct impact of domestic monetary policy.",
        "At the same time, internal inflationary pressure remained – in the assessment of these Council members – limited, and no significant influence of accelerated wage growth on consumer price growth could be seen.",
        "Certain Council members also underlined that price growth took place amid continued moderate lending growth.",
        "Other Council members, in turn, drew attention to the increase in all core inflation measures in the recent period, which – in their assessment – indicated an intensification of domestic inflationary pressure.",
        "These Council members also pointed to a certain increase in the inflation expectations of households and enterprises as well as the gradually rising producer price growth.",
        "While discussing the outlook for price growth, it was indicated that according to the November projection, it would gradually rise to reach the annual average level of 2.3% in 2018 and 2.7% in 2019.",
        "The majority of Council members recognised that the results of the November projection indicated that in the coming years inflation would remain close to the target.",
        "However, some Council members underlined that the inflation path in the November projection was higher than in the previous forecasting round, and that in 2019 inflation would exceed 2.5%.",
        "These Council members judged that the expected inflation growth would be driven by an intensification of domestic inflationary pressure as evidenced by the forecast growth in both core inflation and the value added deflator.",
        "They also pointed out that inflation could be higher than forecast by the current projection due to the possible stronger growth in wage and cost pressure.",
        "Certain of these Council members drew attention to higher coal prices compared to the previous year, which – in their opinion – would boost production costs of many goods, including food products, and would impact directly the prices of some consumer goods.",

        "The Council judged that – given the available information – in the coming years inflation would run close to the inflation target.",
        "As a result, the current level of interest rates was conducive to keeping the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic stability.",
        "The majority of Council members expressed the opinion that, taking into account the present information, interest rates were also likely to remain stable in the coming quarters.",
        "These Council members judged that the stabilisation of interest rates would allow to meet the inflation target, which – as they underlined – is of a symmetric nature.",
        "At the same time, taking into account the expected slowdown in GDP growth in the coming years, it was indicated that a stabilisation of interest rates would support the maintenance of balanced economic growth, including the expected recovery in investment.",
        "Moreover, these Council members pointed out that the need to take into account monetary conditions in the immediate environment of the Polish economy, including the prospect of maintaining negative interest rates in the euro area next year, also spoke in favour of keeping the current level of interest rates.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members, should data and forecasts incoming in the following quarters suggest a more marked intensification of inflationary pressure, it might be justified to consider an increase in the NBP interest rates in the quarters to come.",
        "In the opinion of these Council members, interest rate decisions should take into account in particular the impact of negative real interest rates on lending, asset prices and savings in the Polish economy, as well as growth in the unit variable costs.",
        "An opinion was also expressed that future decisions of the Council should account for developments in inflation expectations.",
        "Certain of these Council members judged that a possible increase in interest rates would have a limited impact on investment growth.",
        "A view was expressed that in the event of a significant decline in economic indicators accompanied by a marked deterioration in consumer and corporate sentiment, in the longer run it might be justified to consider a decrease in interest rates.",
        "Some Council members underlined that in the face of uncertainty about the determinants of monetary policy in the longer term, the March projection of inflation and GDP would be an important prerequisite for an assessment of its prospects.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 1.50%, the lombard rate at 2.50%, the deposit rate at 0.50%, the rediscount rate at 1.75%.",
        "During the meeting the question of lowering the reserve requirement ratio on funds raised from domestic entities for at least a two-year period was also discussed.",
        "It was indicated that this ratio currently stood at 3.5%.",
        "Taking into consideration that funds raised from abroad for the same period are not subject to reserve requirements, it was judged that it would be justified not to calculate reserve requirements also for the remaining funds raised for at least a two-year period, which would mean the equal treatment of such funds.",
        "It was indicated that the application of uniform reserve requirement ratios for all funds raised for at least 2 years would bring the Polish reserve requirement system closer to the solutions applied by the Eurosystem.",
        "Moreover, it was pointed out that the introduction of the discussed change could help to lower the scale of the maturity mismatches between assets and liabilities of Polish institutions subject to mandatory reserve requirements.",
        "The Council adopted a resolution according to which the reserve requirement ratio for funds raised for at least a two-year period will stand at 0%.",
        "The resolution will come into force on 1 March 2018 and will apply starting with the reserve requirement to be maintained from 30 April 2018.",
        "During the discussion on price developments abroad, it was also stressed that core inflation was still low in many economies, and in the case of the euro area it had even posted a decline in March.",
        "Turning to monetary policy abroad, attention was drawn to lower monthly pace of asset purchases by the ECB starting from April.",
        "However, it was underlined that the ECB’s monetary policy was still expansionary, with its interest rates close to zero, including the deposit rate below zero.",
        "It was also pointed out that, although the Federal Reserve had increased its interest rates, it was indicating that monetary policy tightening would proceed at a similar pace to previously expected.",
        "It was noted that sentiment in the global financial markets had been positive, and many emerging market currencies, including the zloty, had appreciated as a result, while share prices had risen, also on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.",
        "While discussing developments in Poland's real economy, it was highlighted that recent data had been pointing to an improvement in economic conditions in 2017 Q1.",
        "It was judged that GDP growth in 2017 Q1 had been slightly higher than in previous quarter, albeit still moderate.",
        "It was emphasised that economic growth was mainly driven by increasing consumer demand, supported by improving labour market conditions, reflected in further growth in employment and wages, and also by very good consumer sentiment and the child benefit payments.",
        "It was underlined that ongoing sound increase in consumer demand in 2017 Q1 was indicated by a rapid rise in retail sales.",
        "However, attention was also drawn to a deceleration in annual industrial production growth as well as a fall in construction and assembly output in February.",
        "At the same time, it was stressed that both could be attributed mainly to statistical effects.",
        "Certain Council members also pointed to industrial sector sentiment in 2017 Q1, which was the strongest in a year.",
        "Regarding Poland’s economic outlook, the Council members underlined that in the coming quarters GDP growth should accelerate at a similar pace to the March GDP projection path.",
        "Economic growth will be supported by expected rise in investment resulting from higher inflows of EU funds, amid a steady rise in consumption.",
        "In this context, certain Council members pointed to an increasing number of contracts on the use of EU funds signed by local government units.",
        "In their opinion, good fiscal position recorded in previous years by local governments should be supportive of their investment expenditures in the coming quarters.",
        "According to certain Council members, it could not be excluded that economic growth in 2017 would be higher than envisaged in the March projection.",
        "Certain Council members judged, however, that the pace of corporate investment growth in the coming quarters was still uncertain.",
        "In addition, it was indicated that further acceleration in consumption growth could be contained by slower increase in real wages resulting from higher price growth compared to a year before.",
        "When analysing inflation developments in Poland, it was stressed that the annual consumer price growth, after a significant rise at the beginning of the year, had declined somewhat in March.",
        "It was assessed that lower inflation had probably resulted from a fall in food prices and waning effects of the earlier global commodity price increases.",
        "Certain Council members cited a further rise in annual growth of producer prices in February, which, in their opinion, could point to intensifying cost pressure.",
        "According to certain Council members, improving economic conditions were contributing to a rise in demand pressure.",
        "Other Council members, however, emphasised that, given still negative output gap and spare capacity in the economy, demand pressure was still limited.",
        "It was also underlined that, despite improving labour market and a minimum wage hike at the beginning of 2017, wage growth, and hence the increase in unit labour costs, were still moderate.",
        "Some Council members noted in addition that the rise in the annual producer price growth rate in February originated mainly from a low base effect.",
        "In their assessment, this could indicate that the growth in cost pressure might have levelled off.",
        "The majority of the Council members assessed that inflation would stabilise at a moderate level in the following quarters.",
        "They indicated that this would be supported by only gradual growth in domestic inflationary pressure related to improving economic conditions in Poland as well as decelerating growth in energy and food prices resulting from dissipating effects of the earlier increase in energy and agricultural commodity prices.",
        "At the same time, in the assessment of certain Council members, inflation might be higher than envisaged by forecasts available at the time of the meeting.",
        "These Council members did not exclude a stronger rise in demand pressure.",
        "They also pointed to an increase in inflation expectations in early 2017.",
        "Hence, they did not rule out that improving labour market could translate into stronger wage growth, and higher consumer price growth as a result.",
        "While discussing NBP’s monetary policy, the Council decided that the interest rates should remain unchanged.",
        "This decision was primarily justified by limited risk of inflation running persistently above the target in the medium term.",
        "At the same time, a decline in the real interest rates, related to higher inflation, should support the acceleration of economic growth in 2017.",
        "The Council confirmed its assessment that, given the available information, the stabilisation of the nominal interest rates helped to keep the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintain macroeconomic balance.",
        "The majority of the Council members assessed that in light of available information stabilisation of the NBP interest rates was likely also in the following quarters.",
        "According to certain Council members, should data and forecasts incoming in the following quarters suggest stronger inflationary pressure than expected at the time of the meeting, it might be justified to consider an increase in the NBP interest rates.",
        "In the opinion of these Council members, the interest rate decisions ought to reflect, in particular, the impact of negative real interest rates on asset prices and the savings rate in the Polish economy.",
        "These Council members drew attention to a gradual deceleration in household deposit growth over the previous six months, which, starting from early 2017, was accompanied by higher inflows to investment funds from the household sector.",
        "Other Council members emphasised, however, that the level of the real interest rates was not the main factor determining the savings rate and asset prices.",
        "They highlighted that the real interest rates in Poland were higher than in other European economies, while interest on loans in real terms was still markedly positive, which contained a risk of excessive lending growth.",
        "In this context, they pointed to moderate lending growth and relatively stable residential real estate prices, despite ongoing recovery in that market.",
        "Certain Council members assessed that a more comprehensive assessment of the impact of lower real interest rates on the economy, and hence on the monetary policy outlook, would be possible after the July inflation and GDP projection.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 1.50%, the lombard rate at 2.50%, the deposit rate at 0.50%, the rediscount rate at 1.75%.",
        "At the same time, it was noted that forecasts for growth in exports of the euro area, Poland's main trading partner, had been revised downwards.",
        "In addition, it was assessed that economic conditions in the United States were strong.",
        "Yet, it was also judged that adverse weather conditions could have had a temporarily negative impact on the US economic activity over recent months.",
        "In turn, in China, monthly indicators suggested that GDP growth might slow down slightly in 2017 Q3.",
        "Referring to price developments in the world economy, it was pointed out that despite the ongoing global recovery, inflation abroad remained moderate.",
        "It was emphasised that this was caused by persistently low domestic inflationary pressure in many countries.",
        "Certain Council members stressed that the reasons for the persistence of low global inflation were highly uncertain, with stronger economic connections within global value chains being cited as one of the likely reasons.",
        "It was pointed out that, according to available forecasts, in the coming years inflation should remain moderate, particularly in the euro area, where it was to run below the level consistent with the ECB’s definition of price stability.",
        "During the discussion it was noted that prices of some commodities, including oil, had risen somewhat of late.",
        "However, it was judged that the rise in oil prices had resulted from temporary factors, including the adverse weather conditions in the United States and geopolitical factors.",
        "Yet, the Council members underlined that the rise in oil price was still contained by high oil supply attributable, most notably, to heightened shale oil production in the United States.",
        "It was pointed out that following a decline caused by weather conditions, shale oil extraction had rebounded at the beginning of October, while exports of this commodity from the United States had surged.",
        "Regarding the monetary policy abroad, it was highlighted that the European Central Bank was keeping interest rates close to zero, including the deposit rate below zero, and was continuing its asset purchase programme.",
        "It was indicated that the market participants expected that the ECB would probably continue to purchase financial assets in 2018, albeit at a diminishing pace.",
        "Moreover, the ECB still signals that it will keep its interest rates unchanged, even after asset purchases come to an end.",
        "It was observed also that the interest rates were low in Central and Eastern European economies.",
        "Referring to the US monetary policy, it was noted that the Federal Reserve continued to gradually reduce the amount of monetary policy accommodation.",
        "In particular, the US central bank is starting to wind down its balance sheet, though at a gradual pace.",
        "It was underlined that, in line with the Federal Reserve’s announcements, the bank's balance sheet would not return to the pre-crisis level in the coming years.",
        "It was also emphasised that the Federal Reserve had lowered its expectations regarding the interest rates over the longer run.",
        "As a result, the interest rates in the coming years will probably remain lower than before the global financial crisis.",
        "While discussing developments in Poland's real economy, the Council members judged that the economic conditions in Poland were favourable.",
        "It was underlined that economic growth was still driven primarily by increasing consumer demand, supported by rising employment and wages, disbursement of benefits and very good consumer sentiment.",
        "Yet, it was indicated that investment expenditures remained low.",
        "However, it was assessed that higher use of EU funds and an acceleration in construction and assembly output growth pointed to a gradual recovery in fixed capital formation.",
        "In the opinion of certain Council members, the scale of the expected recovery in investment remained unclear.",
        "It was also noted that industrial output growth had picked up in August, whereas economic activity indicators in this sector had improved again in September.",
        "At the same time, certain Council members cited still moderate leading economic indicators.",
        "With reference to labour market conditions, it was pointed out that further growth in employment was accompanied by an acceleration in wage and unit labour cost growth.",
        "However, it was stressed that wage growth, even though it had accelerated, remained moderate and markedly lower than in some Central and Eastern European economies.",
        "It is contained by the inflow of foreign employees to Poland as well as higher labour force participation among Poles.",
        "At the same time, many Council members were pointing to a risk of further intensification in wage pressure.",
        "In this context, it was indicated that enterprises were reporting growing difficulties in finding employees.",
        "However, some Council members emphasised that, at the time of the meeting, it was hard to assess whether these difficulties would translate into higher wage growth or rather become a barrier to growth for enterprises.",
        "Certain Council members expressed the opinion that protracted low investment growth might restrain productivity growth over longer run and thereby add to unit labour cost growth.",
        "When analysing price developments in Poland, it was indicated that the annual growth in consumer prices remained moderate and stood at 2.2% in September, i.e.",
        "was slightly higher than expected.",
        "At the same time, it was stressed that core inflation continued at a low level.",
        "The majority of the Council members underlined that, given available forecasts, inflation would remain moderate in the following quarters.",
        "They argued that this would result from moderate price growth in the environment of the Polish economy, alongside a gradual rise in domestic inflationary pressure stemming from improving economic conditions at home.",
        "At the same time, in the opinion of some Council members, in the coming quarters inflation could be higher than forecasted at the time of the meeting due to stronger growth in wage and cost pressures.",
        "In this context, they pointed to a pick-up in producer price growth, also with energy prices excluded.",
        "Certain Council members expressed an opinion that the gas mandatory stock requirement imposed recently on importers of this commodity could be a factor supportive of an increase in its prices.",
        "Certain Council members were of the opinion that, given the underlying trends in some economic variables, inflation might exceed the target in the medium term, particularly in the event of a negative supply shock.",
        "Referring to developments in monetary aggregates, it was stressed that lending to the non-financial sector was growing steadily, in line with the nominal GDP growth rate.",
        "In particular, it was emphasised that, despite the ongoing recovery in the real estate market, mortgage lending growth was stable.",
        "It was also noted that a decline in the value of household deposits had come to a halt in August.",
        "However, certain Council members judged that households could still be shifting funds from bank deposits towards riskier assets.",
        "While discussing NBP monetary policy, the Council decided that interest rates should remain unchanged.",
        "The Council assessed that, despite the favourable economic conditions and wage growth higher than labour productivity growth, inflationary pressure remained limited and there were no imbalances building up in the economy.",
        "The majority of the Council members judged that in the coming quarters inflation would remain moderate, thus the risk of inflation running persistently above the target in the medium term was limited.",
        "As a result, the majority of the Council members assessed that stabilisation of the NBP interest rates was likely in the coming quarters.",
        "It was underlined that the stabilisation of interest rates would allow to meet the inflation target, and at the same time support the expected recovery in investment.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members, should data and forecasts incoming in the following quarters suggest stronger inflationary pressure than expected at the time of the meeting, it might be justified to consider an increase in the NBP interest rates.",
        "In the opinion of these Council members, decisions on the level of interest rates should take into account in particular the impact of negative real interest rates on lending, asset prices and savings in the Polish economy, and also changes in unit variable costs.",
        "An opinion was also expressed that future decisions of the Council should account for developments in inflation expectations.",
        "A view was expressed that in the event of a significant decline in economic indicators accompanied by a marked deterioration in consumer and corporate sentiment in the longer run it might be justified to consider a decrease in interest rates.",
        "The Council judged that – given the available information – the stabilisation of interest rates helped to keep the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintain macroeconomic stability.",
        "Some Council members stressed that the next projection of inflation and GDP would be important for an assessment of the outlook for monetary policy in the coming quarters.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 1.50%, the lombard rate at 2.50%, the deposit rate at 0.50%, the rediscount rate at 1.75%.",
        "During the discussion on the external environment of the Polish economy, it was indicated that economic conditions in the United States remained favourable, while industrial output growth in this economy had accelerated and employment reached record highs, translating into higher than in previous quarters retail sales growth.",
        "Referring to price developments in the world economy, it was underlined that, despite the global recovery, inflation abroad remained moderate.",
        "It was assessed that this was caused by the persistently weak domestic inflationary pressure in many countries.",
        "It was observed that core inflation remained low in many advanced economies.",
        "It was highlighted that price growth was moderate particularly in the immediate environment of the Polish economy, most notably in the euro area, and also in Central and Eastern Europe in spite of a sizeable economic recovery and robust wage growth there.",
        "It was indicated that in recent years the links between economic conditions, wage growth and inflation had weakened in many countries.",
        "While analysing commodity price developments, it was pointed out that oil prices were higher than in previous quarters, yet signs of their stabilisation had appeared in recent weeks.",
        "It was observed that the prices of this commodity might remain stable in the coming quarters.",
        "The Council members stipulated flexible supply of shale oil in the United States and some producers striving to retain their market shares as the likely factors behind the stabilisation of oil prices.",
        "With reference to the remaining energy commodities, it was indicated that prices of coal and natural gas were higher than in previous quarters.",
        "Regarding monetary policy abroad, it was highlighted that the Federal Reserve had started reducing its balance sheet in October, and that in December it would probably raise its interest rates.",
        "However, it was observed that uncertainty persisted as to the scale and timing of further interest rate rises by the US central bank.",
        "Moreover, in this part of the discussion it was emphasised that the European Central Bank was keeping interest rates close to zero, including the deposit rate below zero, and continued to purchase financial assets.",
        "It was also observed that the ECB was still announcing that interest rates would remain at their current levels, even after the end of the asset purchase programme.",
        "It was emphasised that in other countries in the immediate environment of the Polish economy, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe, interest rates also remained close to zero.",
        "Turning to developments in Poland's real economy, the Council members pointed out that annual GDP growth had accelerated to 4.9% in 2017 Q3, i.e.",
        "it was higher than envisaged in the projection.",
        "It was observed that growth was still driven primarily by consumer demand, supported by rising employment and wages, disbursement of benefits and very good consumer confidence.",
        "It was also indicated that stronger than projected GDP growth was mainly due to a significantly higher export growth rate related to the recovery in the external environment of the Polish economy, particularly in the euro area.",
        "It was underlined that gross fixed capital formation had also risen in 2017 Q3, albeit at a slower pace than expected in the projection.",
        "Attention was drawn to the fact that the rise in investment had resulted mainly from higher public investment.",
        "In this context, it was observed that investment growth in firms outside the mining and energy sectors had increased substantially in 2017 Q3.",
        "Yet, certain Council members emphasised that the level of corporate investment was still lower than before 2016.",
        "It was judged that the favourable economic conditions would continue in Poland in the coming quarters, although GDP growth might decelerate slightly in the following years.",
        "Economic activity will still be supported by stable consumption growth, accompanied with a further rise in investment growth rate.",
        "As certain Council members emphasised, the latter is indicated by the rising absorption of EU funds.",
        "Yet, these members noted that the trend had so far been observed mainly in the public sector.",
        "It was also judged that, given high capacity utilisation and a concurrent rise in demand, a further rise in the corporate investment growth rate was likely in the coming quarters.",
        "However, gradual fading of the statistical effects of the \"Family 500 plus\" programme and the expected deceleration of economic growth in the euro area would contain GDP growth.",
        "With reference to labour market conditions, it was noted that the number of persons working in the economy had continued to rise, albeit at a slower pace than in previous quarters and, consequently, the unemployment rate continued to fall.",
        "It was highlighted that, although in the corporate sector growth in wages and wage bill had accelerated somewhat, in the entire economy wage growth had remained stable in 2017 Q3.",
        "It was judged that wage growth in the economy could have been limited by the wage freeze in the public sector, and, possibly, a slower pace of wage growth in smaller enterprises, which employ a large proportion of workers.",
        "It was stressed that, in line with the most recent data, the wages of a considerable part of the employed were still only slightly higher than the minimum wage, additionally curbing inflationary pressure.",
        "Attention was also drawn to the relatively high labour participation rate which, along with a significant number of foreign employees, may be containing wage growth in Poland.",
        "Certain Council members emphasised, however, that the percentage of companies with wage growth increasing faster than labour productivity growth was lower than in the previous year.",
        "It was also underlined that unit labour cost growth in the entire economy had decelerated considerably in 2017 Q3.",
        "As a result, the majority of the Council members judged that despite low unemployment and recruitment difficulties reported by some companies, the labour market did not generate any significant inflationary pressure for the time being.",
        "As regards inflationary developments in Poland, it was pointed out that annual consumer price growth had increased in November to 2.5%.",
        "It was noted that the main factors behind the rise in inflation was high food price growth and markedly higher than in previous years energy price growth.",
        "It was also pointed out that the higher energy price growth was associated with rising energy commodity prices in the global markets.",
        "In addition, it was emphasised that core inflation net of food and energy prices remained low, despite relatively high consumption growth.",
        "When discussing the outlook for inflation, the majority of the Council members assessed that, given the available information, inflation would remain close to the target over the projection horizon.",
        "These members pointed out that core inflation was likely to rise only gradually in the following quarters.",
        "It was judged that the price growth would most likely be contained by low inflation in the environment of the Polish economy and a decline in GDP growth rate expected in the coming quarters.",
        "In addition, statistical base effects would dissipate in the coming months, which should constrain growth in energy prices.",
        "At the same time, some Council members drew attention to the upside risks to inflation.",
        "In their opinion, low corporate investment might translate into weaker labour productivity growth, thus boosting unit labour costs and inflation in the longer term.",
        "They also expressed the opinion that ongoing low investment in the mining and energy sectors could prop up energy price growth.",
        "Certain Council members argued that costs incurred by natural gas importers could be increased due to the requirement to hold natural gas reserves.",
        "While discussing NBP monetary policy, the Council decided that currently interest rates should remain unchanged.",
        "The Council judged that the current interest rate level helped to keep the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintain macroeconomic stability.",
        "It was pointed out that in the light of the available information, inflation would remain close to the target in the projection horizon.",
        "At the same time, attention was drawn to external trade surplus, persisting despite relatively fast GDP growth, as well as to the fact that lending growth remained close to nominal GDP growth.",
        "The majority of the Council members expressed an opinion that, taking into account the present information, interest rates were also likely to remain stable in the coming quarters.",
        "These Council members judged that the stabilisation of interest rates would continue to help meet the inflation target, while supporting the maintenance of balanced economic growth, including the further expected recovery in investment.",
        "Moreover, these Council members pointed out that the need to take into account the monetary conditions in the immediate environment of the Polish economy also spoke in favour of keeping the current level of interest rates.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members, should data and forecasts incoming in the following quarters suggest a more marked intensification of inflationary pressure, most notably associated with a possibility of a stronger acceleration in wage growth, it might be justified to consider an increase in the NBP interest rates in the quarters to come.",
        "In the opinion of these Council members, interest rate decisions should also take into account the impact of negative real interest rates on lending, asset prices and savings in the Polish economy.",
        "The Council members judged that developments in inflation expectations would also be important for monetary policy decisions.",
        "A view was expressed that in the event of a significant decline in economic indicators accompanied by a marked deterioration in consumer and corporate sentiment, in the longer run it might be justified to consider a decrease in interest rates.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 1.50%, the lombard rate at 2.50%, the deposit rate at 0.50% and the rediscount rate at 1.75%.",
        "During the meeting the remuneration on the required reserve was also discussed.",
        "Certain Council members pointed out that decreasing the remuneration on the required reserve should help manifest its mandatory character.",
        "The majority of the Council members pointed out that the remuneration of the required reserve, combined with the decision not to calculate the reserve requirement ratio on funds raised from domestic entities for at least a two-year period, should help to lower the scale of the maturity mismatches between assets and liabilities of Polish institutions that are subject to mandatory reserve requirements.",
        "An opinion was also expressed that the reserve requirement system should not be modified until the decision not to calculate the reserve requirements on funds raised from domestic entities for at least a two-year period came into effect.",
        "The Council adopted a resolution on the remuneration on the required reserve.",
        "In line with this resolution, the remuneration of the required reserve will amount to 0.50%.",
        "The resolution comes into force on 1 January 2018.",
        "at its slowest in over twenty years.",
        "It was observed that forecasts for global economic growth had recently been revised upwards and pointed to its acceleration in 2017.",
        "Certain Council members stressed that it would probably remain weak in the following years.",
        "These Council members pointed to still low investment growth in advanced economies and limited wage growth, resulting in worse private consumption outlook.",
        "In this context, risks to global economic growth were cited.",
        "Attention was drawn to potential spillovers from the expected further slowdown in China and a likely exacerbation of protectionism in the international trade.",
        "In addition, risks for some emerging market economies related to higher USD debt service costs, resulting from monetary policy tightening in the United States, were highlighted.",
        "While discussing price developments abroad, it was emphasised that in recent months inflation had risen significantly in many economies.",
        "It was stressed that the increase was related primarily to higher commodity prices as compared with the previous year, referring particularly to oil, but also coal and agricultural commodities.",
        "It was pointed out, however, that in the euro area demand pressure was still weak, and as a result core inflation was low, albeit diversified across its member states.",
        "The Council members assessed that inflation in the external environment of the Polish economy might level off in the coming quarters on the back of stabilisation in oil prices.",
        "Referring to monetary policy abroad, it was pointed out that the European Central Bank kept interest rates at close to zero, including the deposit rate below zero, and continued its financial asset purchases.",
        "It was also noted that the Federal Reserve indicated more interest rate increases in 2017.",
        "At the same time, it was highlighted that sentiment in the financial markets had been improving further since the previous Council meeting.",
        "While discussing developments in Poland’s real economy, attention was drawn to the preliminary release of GDP data for 2016, which indicated that the annual GDP growth rate in 2016 Q4 had been close to that recorded a quarter earlier.",
        "It was stressed that growth had still been driven primarily by increasing consumer demand, supported by a rise in employment as well as child and social benefit payments.",
        "It was underlined that accelerating consumer growth was probably accompanied by slower pace of decrease in investment on the back of higher use of EU funds under the new financial framework.",
        "In the opinion of certain Council members, investment growth might be still contained by uncertainty in the enterprise sector.",
        "The Council members assessed that economic growth should accelerate in the coming quarters.",
        "Some Council members pointed to recent upward revisions of GDP growth.",
        "Faster GDP growth in the coming quarters will be supported by a rebound in investment growth resulting from further rise in the use of EU funds under the new financial framework.",
        "As some Council members noted, the number of contracts concerning projects co-financed from EU funds signed by local governments is rising, which should also help investment growth.",
        "Certain Council members pointed to relatively high capacity to co-finance EU projects using local government funds, resulting from their sound fiscal position.",
        "This notwithstanding, according to certain Council members, it cannot be excluded that investment growth will remain low in the coming quarters.",
        "While analysing price developments in Poland, it was highlighted that annual consumer price growth had picked up over recent months.",
        "It was observed that, like in many other countries, price growth had resulted mainly from higher global commodity prices as compared with a year before.",
        "Attention was drawn to faster growth in energy prices resulting from higher energy commodity prices, and to an increase in prices of, especially unprocessed, food.",
        "It was argued, however, that domestic inflationary pressure was still contained by moderate growth in unit labour costs and negative output gap in the domestic economy.",
        "In this context, it was underlined that core inflation remained low.",
        "The Council members stressed that short-term forecasts were indicating a substantial rise in inflation in the first few months of 2017.",
        "Yet, it was assessed that inflation would be still supported primarily by the effect of higher global commodity prices, yet it was emphasised that this effect would gradually dissipate.",
        "As a result, the impact of higher world fuel prices will stabilise or might even decline.",
        "While analysing the medium-term inflation outlook, it was underlined that economic growth, despite a slight acceleration in 2017, would not markedly exceed potential GDP growth, and thus would not cause excessive demand pressure.",
        "It was further highlighted that, notwithstanding the intensification of wage demands indicated by enterprises, wage growth remained moderate and did not significantly outpace labour productivity growth.",
        "Yet, certain Council members assessed that wage growth might pick up substantially in the coming quarters, amid a steady decline in the unemployment rate and a gradual rise in inflation expectations.",
        "In their opinion, demand pressure could rise faster than to date.",
        "While discussing NBP’s monetary policy, the Council assessed that the risk of persistently running above the target in the medium term was low.",
        "Such an assessment was justified by the external and most probably temporary nature of the factors behind the marked increase in price growth in early 2017, amid still weak domestic demand pressure.",
        "At the same time, the decline in real interest rates, related to higher inflation, will support the expected acceleration in economic growth.",
        "As a result, the Council confirmed its assessment that the stabilisation of nominal interest rates helped to keep the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintain macroeconomic balance.",
        "The Council members judged that in light of information available at the time of the meeting, stabilisation of the NBP interest rates was the most likely scenario also for the following quarters.",
        "Yet, certain Council members were of the opinion that should inflation turn out to be higher than current forecast, it might be justified to consider an increase in the NBP interest rates in the subsequent quarters.",
        "According to these Council members, the interest rate decisions ought to reflect the impact of real interest rates on savings in Poland.",
        "Yet, the majority of the Council members pointed out that, as the risk of the inflation persistently running above the target over the medium term was low, it was difficult to assess at the time of the meeting when it might be justified to consider an increase in the NBP interest rates.",
        "It was also stressed that an interest rate rise could adversely affect corporate investment growth.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 1.50%, the lombard rate at 2.50%, the deposit rate at 0.50% and the rediscount rate at 1.75%.",
        "At the same time, it was stressed that – in line with projections of the FOMC members – the fed funds rate would probably not exceed its pre-crisis level over the longer run.",
        "The Council members also indicated that sentiment in the financial markets had improved of late.",
        "While discussing developments in Poland’s real economy, it was assessed that in 2016 Q4 GDP growth was probably still subdued.",
        "Available forecasts indicate that GDP growth was curbed by the fall in investment resulting mainly from a temporary decline in the use of EU funds after the completion of the previous EU financial perspective.",
        "As some Council members underlined, investment growth had been also curbed by the uncertainty in the enterprise sector.",
        "It was pointed out that economic growth had been supported by growing consumer demand, an improvement in the labour market, very good consumer sentiment and the child benefit payments.",
        "During the discussion on the labour market conditions, attention was drawn to ongoing stable growth in employment in the enterprise sector and the low unemployment rate.",
        "It was also stressed that the Labour Force Survey in 2016 Q3 had shown weak growth in the number of the employed in the economy.",
        "It was assessed that slower employment growth could reflect the deceleration in GDP growth and labour supply constraints.",
        "It was pointed out that wage growth had been moderate so far, but might accelerate in the coming quarters.",
        "In this context, attention was drawn to higher wage demands indicated by enterprises in 2016 Q4.",
        "It was also underlined that in 2017 wage growth would be additionally supported by a minimum wage hike.",
        "Council members assessed that the slowdown in GDP growth observed in the second half of 2016 had been temporary and that in 2017 economic growth should accelerate.",
        "In the opinion of the Council members, the acceleration in GDP growth in the coming quarters would be supported by a gradual increase in investment growth and stable rise in consumption.",
        "It was emphasised that monthly data signalled some improvement in economic activity over the recent past.",
        "It was indicated that industrial output, construction and retail sales growth in November 2016 all had come out higher than expected, while industrial sentiment had improved markedly in December.",
        "Certain Council members additionally drew attention to notable acceleration in production of minerals used in construction in late 2016.",
        "In their opinion, this could point to recovering investment in structures.",
        "In the assessment of certain Council members, investment growth would also be supported by the recently launched \"Housing Plus\" scheme.",
        "The majority of the Council members were of the opinion that – given good labour market conditions and the child benefit payments – consumer demand outlook remained favourable.",
        "However, it was pointed out that higher prices of energy, including fuels, would reduce spending capacity of households and companies, weighing on demand growth in the economy.",
        "Certain Council members pointed to recent downward revisions in economic growth forecasts by some institutions.",
        "While analysing price developments in Poland, it was stressed that in December 2016 the annual growth in prices of consumer goods and services had picked up notably, but remained moderate.",
        "Attention was also drawn to ongoing acceleration in producer prices.",
        "It was noted, however, that price growth was mainly supported by energy commodity prices being higher than a year before and stronger US dollar.",
        "It was argued that price growth was still contained by low inflationary pressure abroad and negative output gap in the domestic economy.",
        "In this context, some Council members pointed to core inflation remaining close to zero.",
        "The Council members assessed that price growth would continue to increase in the coming months, supported by energy prices being higher than a year before and the expected acceleration in economic growth.",
        "Attention was also drawn to recent upward revisions of price growth forecasts for Poland.",
        "Some Council members assessed that inflation might rise faster than currently anticipated.",
        "They pointed to probable increase in wage growth in the coming quarters and assessed a rise in demand pressure as likely.",
        "Other Council members emphasised, however, that price growth in the coming months would remain moderate, and that the current forecasts did not indicate any risk of overshooting inflation target in the coming quarters.",
        "These Council members also stressed that despite an increase in wage demands indicated by enterprises, wage growth was moderate, and only slightly exceeded labour productivity growth.",
        "Moreover, as further rise in commodity prices is currently not expected, this factor will prop up inflation only temporarily.",
        "It was also indicated that economic growth in the coming quarters would probably not significantly outpace potential output growth, thus demand pressure would remain contained.",
        "While discussing the NBP interest rates, the Council members judged that they should be kept unchanged.",
        "Council members emphasised that although the current price growth had picked up significantly in recent months and inflation forecasts had been revised upwards, this was mainly driven by external factors whose impact should dissipate in the medium term.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that, along with rising inflation, interest rates in real terms would decline, which should support the expected acceleration in economic growth.",
        "The Council confirmed its assessment that the stabilisation of the nominal interest rates helped to keep the Polish economy on the sustainable growth path and maintain macroeconomic stability.",
        "The Council members pointed out that in light of information available at the time of the meeting, stabilisation of the NBP interest rates in the following quarters was the most likely scenario.",
        "Certain Council members believed, however, that given the expected rise in inflation and the related reduction of interest rates in real terms, it might be justified to consider interest rate hikes in the future.",
        "In the opinion of these members of the Council, interest rate decisions should take into account their impact on savings in the Polish economy.",
        "Other Council members judged that the Council decisions should account for their impact on the interest paid on loans.",
        "Some Council members argued, however, that given no risk of overshooting the inflation target in the coming quarters, it was difficult to assess when it might be justified to consider an increase in the NBP interest rates.",
        "Moreover, certain Council members pointed out that the rise in the interest rates could adversely affect corporate investment growth.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 1.50%, the lombard rate at 2.50%, the deposit rate at 0.50% and the rediscount rate at 1.75%.",
        "At the same time, a deterioration in residential real estate market conditions was not excluded given higher mortgage interest rates.",
        "As to emerging market economies, a recent stabilisation in economic conditions in China was cited.",
        "It was also mentioned that Russia had recovered from recession.",
        "While discussing price developments abroad, it was emphasised that commodity price growth had recently come to a halt.",
        "It was stressed that oil prices had been stable for several months.",
        "As certain Council members assessed, the stabilisation in oil prices resulted from higher investment in shale oil extraction industry in the United States on the one hand and production cuts in many oil net exporters on the other.",
        "It was therefore highlighted that even though inflation in the environment of the Polish economy had increased again in February, reaching inflation targets in many countries, its pace had been weaker than a month earlier.",
        "In addition, it was stressed that in many economies, including the euro area, demand pressure stayed weak, and core inflation was still low as a result.",
        "Some Council members assessed that oil prices were unlikely to follow an upward trend in the coming quarters, thus limiting the rise in global inflation.",
        "However, certain Council members were of the opinion that the signs of global economic recovery observed in recent quarters could translate into higher demand pressure in many economies, resulting in a rise in inflation.",
        "In the opinion of certain Council members, a likely rise in wage growth associated with upcoming elections in some euro area member states was posing an additional upside risk to inflation in this economy.",
        "Referring to monetary policy abroad, it was pointed out that the Federal Reserve had indicated a further rise in interest rates in 2017.",
        "It was pointed out that the probability of a hike in fed funds rate in March had increased of late.",
        "At the same time, it was assessed that tighter monetary policy in the United States had been translating into higher government bond yields in many countries, including in Poland.",
        "Yet, it was underlined that the rise in yields had been contained by ongoing quantitative easing and negative interest rates in the euro area.",
        "While discussing the developments in Poland’s real economy, it was emphasised that GDP growth in 2016 Q4 had been slightly higher than a quarter earlier.",
        "It was indicated that economic growth had been mainly driven by increasing consumer demand, supported by improving labour market, very good consumer sentiment as well as child and social benefit payments.",
        "It was underlined that in 2016 Q4 a fall in investment had narrowed due to higher absorption of EU funds.",
        "Certain Council members mentioned in addition an ongoing expansion in housing investment.",
        "Council members stressed that recent economic data had been indicating further recovery.",
        "Attention was drawn to an acceleration in industrial output and retail sales growth in January 2017.",
        "It was highlighted that construction and assembly output had posted a growth in annual terms in January for the first time in over a year.",
        "It was emphasised, however, that sentiment in manufacturing had weakened somewhat in February 2017.",
        "In addition, it was noted that better data readings in January had resulted to some extent from statistical effects.",
        "Some Council members also drew attention to a slowdown in corporate lending over recent months, suggesting that this might indicate still weak investment demand.",
        "In this context, certain Council members pointed to spare capacity in the economy.",
        "While discussing the labour market conditions, attention was drawn to accelerating employment and wage growth in the enterprise sector in January 2017.",
        "At the same time, it was indicated that data for the entire economy was suggesting rather weak rise in the number of working persons and a slower increase in wages in 2016 Q4, translating into slower growth in unit labour costs.",
        "Regarding the Poland’s macroeconomic outlook, it was emphasised that – according to the March GDP projection – economic growth in 2017 should pick up markedly, supported by a significant rise in investment amid higher inflow of EU funds, as well as ongoing robust consumption growth.",
        "Certain Council members indicated that a substantial acceleration in gross fixed capital formation in 2017 would result mostly from a stronger rise in infrastructural investment, with only a moderate increase in corporate investment.",
        "These Council members were of the opinion that such composition of the increase in gross fixed capital formation might be less supportive of economic growth over the medium term.",
        "Other Council members assessed, however, that corporate investment growth might be aided by lower legal uncertainty.",
        "It was indicated that NBP’s GDP projection for 2017 was higher than external forecasts.",
        "Yet, it was stressed that GDP growth, having picked up considerably in 2017, might weaken slightly in the coming years and should not exceed potential output growth to a large extent.",
        "Some Council members pointed to downside risks to economic activity in the coming years, i.a.",
        "a likely negative impact of higher commodity prices on household consumption growth.",
        "While analysing price developments in Poland, it was highlighted that annual consumer price growth had picked up considerably over recent months.",
        "It was stressed that price growth had resulted mainly from higher global commodity prices translating into a rise in energy prices, as well as from increase in agricultural commodity prices reflected in higher food price growth.",
        "It was emphasised that core inflation was still low, indicating ongoing weak demand pressure.",
        "It was pointed out that wage pressure was also limited, which was reflected in still moderate unit labour costs.",
        "The Council members underlined that – in line with the March inflation projection – following a considerable increase in the first months of the year, inflation would stabilise at a moderate level in the following quarters.",
        "Certain Council members judged that in the coming quarters inflation might be higher than envisaged in the March projection.",
        "On the one hand, these Council members did not exclude stronger demand pressure, and on the other hand, they pointed to upside risks to wage growth related to a possible decline in labour force participation after the reduction of the statutory retirement age in Poland.",
        "They also drew attention to stronger cost pressure in recent months, reflected in rising PPI, which may translate into higher consumer price growth.",
        "Other Council members indicated, however, that as the effects of higher global commodity prices dissipated, cost pressure should be fading out.",
        "Moreover, some Council members assessed that domestic inflationary pressure would grow only gradually, as economic growth was to run close to potential product growth in the coming years and there was still spare capacity in the economy.",
        "In addition, certain Council members expressed an opinion that wage pressure in the Polish economy would probably stay subdued due to weak bargaining position of Polish employees.",
        "While discussing NBP’s monetary policy, the Council decided that the interest rates should be left unchanged at the current meeting.",
        "In the opinion of the Council, given the current data and forecasts, including the March inflation projection, the risk of inflation running persistently above the target in the medium term was limited.",
        "At the same time, the decline in the real interest rates, related to higher inflation, would support the acceleration of economic growth in 2017.",
        "The Council confirmed its assessment that the stabilisation of the nominal interest rates helped to keep the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintain macroeconomic balance.",
        "The majority of the Council members judged that in light of available information stabilisation of the NBP interest rates was likely also in the following quarters.",
        "Yet, certain Council members were of the opinion that should incoming data and forecasts suggest stronger inflationary pressure than assumed in the March projection, it might be justified to consider an increase in the NBP interest rates.",
        "According to certain Council members, the interest rate decisions ought to reflect the impact of real interest rates on asset prices and savings in Poland.",
        "However, other Council members emphasised that the level of the real interest rates was not the main factor determining the savings rate and asset prices in the Polish economy.",
        "Moreover, certain Council members stressed that the interest rate increases might adversely affect corporate investment growth.",
        "Certain Council members underlined that in the coming months the analysis of the robustness and scale of the recovery and the resulting price developments should factor in the impact of the negative real interest rates on macroeconomic developments and asset prices.",
        "Other Council members pointed out that a more comprehensive assessment of the monetary policy outlook would be possible after the following projections of inflation and GDP.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 1.50%, the lombard rate at 2.50%, the deposit rate at 0.50% and the rediscount rate at 1.75%.",
        "during the discussion it was pointed out that current data in China indicated a gradual slowdown in country’s economic growth.",
        "While discussing price developments abroad, it was emphasised that despite the ongoing global recovery, inflation had remained moderate and had even slightly declined in some countries.",
        "In this context, attention was drawn to the stabilisation of global energy commodity prices in the recent period.",
        "In the opinion of the Council members, owing to the increased use of shale oil in the United States and the high oil stocks, the prices of oil have currently become less sensitive to changes in global economic conditions and to OPEC decisions to restrict oil production.",
        "During the discussion on monetary policy abroad, it was pointed out that, despite the strengthening of the economic recovery in the euro area, the European Central Bank had revised downward its medium-term inflation forecasts for the euro area economy.",
        "Currently it is expected that also in the coming years inflation in the euro area will remain below the ECB's inflation target.",
        "Taking this into account, the European Central Bank keeps interest rates close to zero, including the deposit rate below zero, and continues its asset purchase programme.",
        "In reference to the United States, it was pointed out that the Federal Reserve was continuing monetary policy tightening by raising interest rates and signalling the possibility of decreasing its reinvestment of the principal payments from securities in the coming quarters.",
        "While discussing developments in Poland's real economy, the Council members stressed that monthly data on economic activity signalled a continuation of stable GDP growth in 2017 Q2.",
        "It was judged that a further rise in retail sales amid very good consumer sentiment indicated still high private consumption growth.",
        "Moreover, attention was drawn to the increased growth in both industrial output and construction and assembly output in May after their marked weakening in April.",
        "Similarly, leading economic indicators suggest a continuation of favourable trends in the corporate sector.",
        "It was assessed that – along with the expected growth in the use of EU funds – this should support gross fixed capital formation, while also stressing that under the July projection investment growth in 2017 Q2 was probably only slightly positive.",
        "In reference to the July projection, it was underlined that economic growth over the coming quarters would remain close to its current level, and would then run close to potential output growth.",
        "The Council members indicated that, although rising consumer demand remained the main driver of growth, in the coming quarters its role would diminish due to the gradual fading of the statistical effects of the \"Family 500 plus\" programme introduced in 2016 on consumption growth.",
        "At the same time, a further recovery in investment is forecast beginning from the second half of 2017.",
        "Certain Council members pointed to the still low investment rate in the Polish economy compared to many other European countries, which could have a negative effect on potential output growth.",
        "When analysing inflation developments in Poland, it was emphasised that annual growth of consumer prices remained moderate and even decreased in June.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that core inflation, although gradually increasing, remained low.",
        "The Council members judged that these developments in inflation followed from fading effects of the past increase in global commodity prices, with only a gradual rise in domestic inflationary pressure stemming from improving domestic economic conditions.",
        "While discussing the outlook for price developments in Poland, it was emphasised that – under the July projection – consumer price inflation should remain moderate and approach the target towards the end of the projection horizon.",
        "This will result from the gradual increase in core inflation related to the continuation of favourable economic conditions, amid lower growth in import prices.",
        "The majority of the Council members judged the risk to price stability in the medium term to be limited.",
        "Yet, in the opinion of certain Council members, the impact of factors increasing inflation over the coming years could prove stronger than had been forecast in the July projection, while the impact of factors holding back inflation could be weaker than anticipated in the projection.",
        "With reference to the situation in the labour market, attention was drawn to a further increase in employment and wages in the corporate sector.",
        "In the opinion of the Council members, in the coming quarters wage growth could continue to increase due to the likely further rise in employment amid the emerging labour supply-side constraints.",
        "At the same time, the expected continuation of increases in labour productivity growth was highlighted, which would limit the unit labour cost growth in the coming years.",
        "In this context, certain Council members pointed to the risk of lower labour immigration of Ukrainian citizens to Poland, and also a possible decrease in the labour force participation rate following the introduction of the lower retirement age.",
        "The Council members also discussed the consequences of interest rates remaining unchanged for a prolonged time amid expectations of a gradual growth in inflation in the coming years.",
        "Certain Council members pointed out that the prolonging of the period of negative real interest rates could increase the risk of the emergence of the negative effects of this phenomenon.",
        "In particular, these Council members emphasised that low interest on deposits encourages households to search for assets offering higher yields and therefore also associated with higher risk.",
        "In this context, certain Council members pointed to the decrease in the level of household deposits in May.",
        "At the same time, it was observed that the relatively low interest on loans supported the rise in household debt.",
        "However, other Council members stressed that so far no negative consequences of interest rates remaining at the current level could be observed.",
        "In this context, they underlined that, although the structure of household assets could gradually change, deposits were still their largest component, while loan growth and the stable share of non-performing loans in banks' credit portfolios, did not indicate excessive indebtedness of households.",
        "While discussing NBP monetary policy, the Council decided that interest rates should remain unchanged.",
        "The Council members assessed that, despite favourable economic conditions, good labour market conditions and gradual rise in wage growth, inflationary pressure remained limited and there were no imbalances building up in the economy.",
        "At the same time, available forecasts, including the July projection, indicate that inflation will remain moderate in the coming quarters.",
        "Therefore, in the Council's assessment, the risk of inflation running persistently above the target in the medium term was limited.",
        "The majority of the Council members assessed that stabilisation of the NBP interest rates was likely in the following quarters, since – given the available information – it had been helping to keep the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintain macroeconomic balance.",
        "In addition, the majority of the Council members assessed that the stabilisation of the interest rates would support the expected recovery in investment.",
        "In the opinion of certain Council members, should data and forecasts incoming in the following quarters suggest stronger inflationary pressure than expected at the time of the meeting, it might be justified to consider an increase in the NBP interest rates.",
        "In the opinion of these Council members, decisions on the level of interest rates should take into account in particular the impact of negative real interest rates on lending, asset prices and savings rate in the Polish economy.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 1.50%, the lombard rate at 2.50%, the deposit rate at 0.50%, the rediscount rate at 1.75%.",
        "at a moderate pace, and that investment growth was estimated to decelerate in 2017 Q1.",
        "It was stressed that sentiment indicators in the euro area had improved substantially in recent months, which, however, had not yet been fully reflected in data on economic activity.",
        "The decline in the 2017 Q1 growth rate in the United States was also cited, with an emphasis on its temporary nature.",
        "The Council members also pointed to an unexpected pick-up in the GDP growth rate in China, yet stressed that the latest data did not indicate a sustained acceleration of growth in this economy.",
        "With reference to price developments abroad, it was observed that in many countries the annual inflation rates were markedly higher than in 2016.",
        "Yet, it was emphasised that a bulk of the increase had taken place in early 2017, while more recently inflation had stabilised.",
        "It was assessed, however, that this had resulted mainly from fading effects of the earlier rise in energy commodity prices, which had been propping up the annual price growth rates over preceding months.",
        "A decrease in energy commodity prices since the previous Council meeting was cited in this context.",
        "During discussion on inflation, it was stressed that in many economies, including the euro area, wage growth was still moderate, and inflation expectations were low.",
        "Turning to monetary policy abroad, it was pointed out that the European Central Bank was keeping the interest rates close to zero, including the deposit rate below zero, and was continuing its asset purchase programme.",
        "It was also observed that the Federal Reserve was indicating further monetary policy tightening.",
        "Despite this, it was emphasised that sentiment in the international financial markets had been improving, which had translated into an appreciation of many emerging market currencies in the period preceding the Council meeting.",
        "While discussing developments in Poland’s real economy, the Council members pointed to flash GDP estimate which had indicated a considerable rise in the economic growth rate in 2017 Q1.",
        "It was assessed that economic growth was still driven primarily by increasing consumer demand, supported by rising employment and wages, good consumer sentiment and disbursement of child and social benefits.",
        "In the opinion of the Council members, improving conditions in industry and construction, confirmed by monthly data, may indicate that the 2017 Q1 economic growth had also benefited from a gradual recovery of investment demand.",
        "Some Council members noted that the pick-up in the annual GDP growth rate could result in part from a statistical base effect.",
        "In this context, they pointed to a downward revision to GDP growth data for 2016.",
        "In the Council’s opinion, in the coming quarters GDP growth should be supported by further investment recovery amid rising inflow of EU funds, along with stable consumer growth.",
        "At the same time, exports should continue to rise rapidly, propped up by economic recovery abroad.",
        "As a result, GDP growth in 2017 should be markedly higher than in 2016.",
        "The Council members stressed that a more comprehensive assessment of Poland’s economic outlook for the coming quarters would be possible after becoming acquainted with NBP’s July projection of GDP.",
        "When analysing inflation developments in Poland, it was stressed that annual growth in consumer prices had stabilised at a moderate level following a significant rise at the beginning of 2017.",
        "As certain Council members underlined, inflation had stabilised somewhat earlier than expected.",
        "It was judged that this had resulted from fading effects of the previous increases in global commodity prices.",
        "At the same time, it was underlined that core inflation, though gradually increasing, remained low.",
        "Certain Council members pointed to a rise in prices for services, which had been contributing to the increase in core inflation.",
        "Moreover, these Council members indicated that in 2017 Q1 labour costs were playing an increasingly important role in price developments.",
        "They also drew attention to a significant rise in the annual producer price growth rate over recent months.",
        "However, other Council members emphasised that, despite higher wage growth in 2017 Q1, growth in unit labour costs was still moderate, amid rising labour productivity.",
        "It was also stressed that the increase in the annual producer price growth rate in February and March 2017 resulted from a low reference base.",
        "The majority of the Council members assessed that in the coming quarters inflation would remain moderate.",
        "They judged that this would be supported by only a gradual rise in domestic inflationary pressure related to improving economic conditions in Poland, together with a fall in the annual growth rate of energy and food prices resulting from fading effects of the earlier increase in commodity prices.",
        "However, certain Council members assessed that inflation in the coming quarters could turn out to be higher than currently forecast.",
        "In their opinion, the risk that the wage pressure might intensify had grown over recent months.",
        "According to these Council members, upside risks might stem from lower immigration to Poland following the EU visa liberalisation with Ukraine and a possible decrease in the labour force participation rate after the introduction of lower retirement age.",
        "Moreover, certain Council members indicated that adverse weather conditions in the period preceding the Council meeting could translate into an increase in the food price growth rate in Poland.",
        "While discussing NBP monetary policy, the Council decided that the interest rates should remain unchanged.",
        "The Council assessed that, despite improving economic conditions and good labour market conditions, inflationary pressure was limited and there were no imbalances building up in the economy.",
        "At the same time, the available forecasts indicate that inflation will remain moderate in the coming quarters.",
        "Therefore, in the Council's assessment, the risk of inflation running persistently above the target in the medium term is limited.",
        "The majority of the Council members assessed that stabilisation of the NBP interest rates was likely in the following quarters, since – given the available information – it had been helping to keep the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintain macroeconomic balance.",
        "In the opinion of certain Council members, should data and forecasts incoming in the following quarters suggest stronger inflationary pressure than expected at the time of the meeting, it might be justified to consider an increase in the NBP interest rates.",
        "The Council members concluded that a more comprehensive assessment of the monetary policy outlook would be possible after becoming acquainted with the incoming NBP’s inflation and GDP projections.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 1.50%, the lombard rate at 2.50%, the deposit rate at 0.50%, the rediscount rate at 1.75%.",
        "During the discussion it was also pointed out that GDP growth had stabilised in China in 2017 Q2, although at the same time attention was drawn to the imbalances that remained in this economy.",
        "While discussing price developments abroad, it was emphasised that despite the ongoing global recovery, inflation abroad had remained moderate.",
        "In particular, it was pointed out that in the major advanced economies inflation continued to run below their respective inflation targets.",
        "While discussing factors impacting inflationary pressure abroad, attention was drawn to a slight increase in oil prices and their expected stabilisation in the coming years.",
        "In the opinion of Council members, owing in particular to the increased use of shale oil in the United States, oil prices have become less sensitive to changes in global economic conditions.",
        "Council members also pointed to the growth in US activity in the global gas market.",
        "In the opinion of Council members, as a result, the upward impact of energy commodity prices on inflation will probably be limited.",
        "During the discussion on monetary policy abroad, it was pointed out that the European Central Bank was keeping interest rates close to zero, including the deposit rate below zero, and continuing its asset purchase programme.",
        "The persistence of moderate inflation in the euro area, related to low wage pressure in this economy and the appreciation of the euro, spoke in favour of preserving the strongly accommodative monetary policy of the ECB.",
        "It was indicated that low wage pressure and the appreciation of the euro increased the risk of another downward revision of inflation forecasts in euro area economy, despite the strengthening recovery there.",
        "As a result – as it was emphasised – inflation in the euro area would probably remain below the ECB's inflation target also in the coming years.",
        "In reference to the United States, it was underlined that the Federal Reserve would probably continue to gradually reduce the accommodative stance of its monetary policy, announcing in the near future the phasing out of reinvestment of maturing securities.",
        "At the same time, due to the decline in inflation, the pace of further interest rate increases by the Fed may be slower than previously expected.",
        "While discussing developments in Poland's real economy, Council members pointed out that in 2017 Q2 GDP growth was close to that observed in 2017 Q1.",
        "It was underlined that growth continued to be driven primarily by increasing consumer demand, supported by rising employment and wages, disbursement of benefits and very good consumer sentiment.",
        "However, investment growth was still weak, as the fall in corporate investment had deepened somewhat, despite high capacity utilization and a further improvement in business conditions.",
        "Council members judged that the gradual recovery in investment financed with EU funds suggested that total investment growth would be higher in the second half of 2017.",
        "At the same time, export growth proved slower than import growth in 2017 Q2, and as a result, the contribution of net exports to GDP turned negative.",
        "Council members indicated that the weakening of export growth could be related to the slowdown in Germany's export growth due to the strong ties between Polish and German producers within global supply chains.",
        "In view of the improving economic situation abroad, the weakening of export growth may, however, be a temporary phenomenon.",
        "When referring to monthly data on economic activity in Poland at the beginning of 2017 Q3, Council members underlined that the data indicated a continuation of stable GDP growth.",
        "It was judged that further stable growth in retail sales amid very good consumer sentiment suggested continued high growth in private consumption.",
        "At the same time, attention was drawn to a certain slowdown in industrial output growth and a strong acceleration in construction and assembly output growth in July.",
        "Moreover, it was stressed that leading economic indicators suggested a continuation of favourable trends in the corporate sector.",
        "When analysing inflation developments in Poland, it was indicated that the annual growth of consumer prices remained moderate and stood at 1.8% in August.",
        "At the same time, it was underlined that core inflation continued at a low level.",
        "Council members judged that inflation would remain moderate also in the following quarters.",
        "This will result from a gradual rise in domestic inflationary pressure stemming from improving domestic economic conditions, alongside a decline in import price growth due to the expected stabilisation of energy commodity prices and low inflationary pressure abroad.",
        "However, certain Council members indicated that further growth in food prices could be a factor increasing inflation in the coming quarters.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members, the November projection, taking into account the latest data, will be important for an assessment of the inflation outlook.",
        "With reference to the situation in the labour market, it was stressed that the further growth in employment and reduction in unemployment in 2017 Q2 was accompanied by a pick-up in wage growth in the corporate sector and the economy as a whole.",
        "It was pointed out that compared to other countries of the region wage growth in Poland remained moderate and continued to be curbed by the inflow of employees from Ukraine as well as by the further rise in the labour force participation rate among Poles.",
        "In the opinion of Council members, in the coming quarters wage growth could continue to increase due to the likely further rise in employment amid the emerging labour supply-side constraints.",
        "In the opinion of certain Council members, in particular the lowering of the retirement age could adversely affect the labour supply.",
        "However, other Council members judged that many people who will take retirement could remain active in the labour market, thus the impact of this factor on the labour supply may be limited.",
        "Council members also discussed the size and structure of savings in the economy.",
        "It was pointed out that the total savings rate – with enterprises contributing the largest share of savings in Poland – exceeded the investment to GDP ratio.",
        "In reference to households, some Council members judged that their propensity to save depended to a large extent on the level of their disposable income, and should increase alongside a rise in employment and wages.",
        "At the same time, in the opinion of these Council members, the expected income from investing funds has less impact on the decision to save.",
        "However, other Council members argued that keeping NBP interest rates unchanged amidst gradually rising inflation could adversely affect households’ propensity to save or encourage them to shift funds towards riskier assets.",
        "While discussing NBP monetary policy, the Council decided that interest rates should remain unchanged.",
        "The Council assessed that, despite favourable economic conditions, good labour market conditions and wage growth continuing to exceed nominal productivity growth, inflationary pressure remained limited and there were no imbalances building up in the economy.",
        "At the same time, available forecasts indicate that in the coming quarters inflation will remain moderate.",
        "Therefore, in the Council's assessment, the risk of inflation running persistently above the target in the medium term was limited.",
        "The majority of the Council members assessed that stabilisation of the NBP interest rates were likely in the coming quarters, since – given the available information – it had been helping to keep the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintain macroeconomic balance.",
        "In addition, the majority of Council members assessed that the stabilisation of interest rates would support the expected recovery in investment.",
        "In the opinion of certain Council members, should data and forecasts incoming in the following quarters suggest stronger inflationary pressure than expected at the time of the meeting, it might be justified to consider an increase in the NBP interest rates.",
        "In the opinion of these Council members, decisions on the level of interest rates should take into account in particular the impact of negative real interest rates on lending, asset prices and the savings rate in the Polish economy, while according to other Council members also on changes in unit variable costs.",
        "A view was also expressed that in the event of a significant decline in economic indicators accompanied by a marked deterioration in consumer and corporate sentiment, it may be justified to consider a decrease in interest rates.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 1.50%, the lombard rate at 2.50%, the deposit rate at 0.50%, the rediscount rate at 1.75%."

    "2010": [
        "At the meeting, the Monetary Policy Council discussed primarily the interaction of the outlook for economic growth and inflation abroad and in Poland in the light of the February projection of the NBP, and the situation in the labour and credit markets.",
        "It was pointed out that the better than expected GDP data for 2009 Q4 as well as the rise in industrial output and retail sales in January 2010, signalled further improvement in the economic activity in the United States.",
        "It was pointed out that increase in inventories might indicate an improvement in the assessment of future demand.",
        "A gradual deceleration of the unfavourable tendencies in the American labour market was also stressed.",
        "At the same time, some Council members listed the following factors likely to pose risk for sustainable recovery in the American economy: weakening of upward trends in the real estate market, further curbing of bank lending to the private sector and persistently high budget deficit.",
        "While analyzing the situation in the euro area, the contrast between GDP growth in this economy as compared to GDP growth in the American economy was emphasized.",
        "A marked decline in industrial output in December 2009 and a low GDP growth in the euro area in 2009 Q4, including the stagnation in Germany, was stressed.",
        "Considerable differences in the situation of particular euro area countries were noted and it was argued that fiscal problems of Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain is an important risk factor for sustainable recovery in this economy.",
        "At the same time, further improvement in the business confidence indicators in the euro area was noted.",
        "Additionally, high growth in Asian economies whose demand might constitute a factor stimulating recovery in the economies being Poland’s major trading partners was stressed.",
        "Moreover, some Council members pointed out that an important risk factor for sustainable recovery in the global economy and, as a result, in the Polish economy, were the effects of the expected unwinding of stimulus packages in many countries.",
        "Other Council members indicated that deterioration in economic activity abroad and, consequently, in the Polish economy, might occur, among other things, due to a difficult fiscal situation in the developed countries.",
        "Some members of the Council argued that – despite weak GDP growth in the euro area, and in particular in Germany – a gradual increase in the Polish exports and imports had been noted, which resulted from Polish trade being more strongly connected with exports of Poland's main trading partners than with domestic demand in those countries.",
        "Additionally, some Council members indicated that in the case of considerable weakening of economic growth in the external environment of the Polish economy, depreciation of the nominal zloty exchange rate would be more likely than its appreciation.",
        "Combined with decreasing unit labour costs in industry this would increase price competitiveness of enterprises as compared with foreign countries, supporting positive contribution of net exports to GDP growth.",
        "While discussing the situation in the Polish economy, the Council pointed at higher than expected growth in industrial output, continued improvement in business confidence indicators and further upward revision of GDP growth forecasts for 2010, prepared by external analysts.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members the released data indicate faster than previously expected acceleration of  Warszawa Świętokrzy ska  no (22)  51 GPD growth.",
        "Some members of the Council assessed that retail sales growth in December 2009, being lower than anticipated in majority of forecasts, had resulted primarily from unfavourable weather conditions and was not a sign of weakening demand.",
        "Members of the Council pointed at a difficult situation in the public finance sector, including worse – as compared with the previous years – situation of the local government entities.",
        "Some Council members argued that the decrease in the number of employed in the public sector, as indicated by the BAEL data for 2009 Q4, and the possibility of this decrease being continued in view of the necessary reduction of public finance imbalance, might translate into lower income of some households, and, as a result, lower domestic demand.",
        "Yet, other Council members – pointing at difference between the growth of income from employment in the enterprise sector and the growth of income from employment in total – argued that the public finance sector, so far, had been increasing wage pressure rather than easing it.",
        "While analyzing labour market data, majority of the Council members assessed that gradual stabilization of employment in the enterprise sector observed in the past few months might signal some deceleration of the unfavourable labour market tendencies.",
        "Yet, in the opinion of some Council members further rise in unemployment rate, driven by increased labour force participation amidst low labour demand, should support maintaining low wage pressure in the coming months.",
        "However, other Council members pointed at the negative impact of demographic factors on labour supply which would stimulate the wage pressure in the coming years.",
        "While discussing the outlook for bank lending, some members of the Council assessed that banks’ credit policy towards enterprises continued to be restrictive.",
        "This may have a negative impact on enterprises’ activity the more so as persistently high share of companies has low liquidity.",
        "Those Council members indicated that Recommendation T issued in February 2010 by the Polish Financial Supervision Authority would contribute to reduced loan availability for households.",
        "According to those Council members the possible further weakening of bank lending to the private sector will be a factor curbing economic growth in Poland, which may – in the opinion of some Council members – speak in favour of the central bank taking additional measures stimulating indirectly bank lending.",
        "Other members of the Council argued that high net profitability of enterprises coupled with high depreciation write-offs, and, as a result – in the opinion of those Council members – good liquidity situation of companies enables them to finance both their current and investment activities with their own funds, which limits their demand for loans.",
        "Those Council members also stressed a continued decline in the number of companies with very low liquidity and no liquidity problems being reported by majority of enterprises.",
        "They also pointed at the accelerating quarterly increases in household debt, including, in particular, a relatively high growth in housing loans.",
        "Those Council members indicated that the amount of housing loan instalments depended primarily on the level of interest rates in Poland.",
        "In their opinion, too late tightening of monetary policy aimed at stabilizing inflation at the target might require considerably stronger increases of the NBP interest rates in the future which would be conducive to significantly higher housing loan instalments.",
        "While discussing the inflation developments it was pointed out that a slight rise in inflation above the upper limit for deviations from the inflation target in January 2010 was most probably a temporary phenomenon.",
        "Majority of the Council members emphasized that subsequent months were expected to bring a strong decline in inflation, even close to the lower limit for deviations from the inflation target.",
        "In the opinion of those Council members the strong decline in inflation would be driven primarily by base effects connected with high increases in regulated prices at the beginning of 2009 and by a decline in import prices being the result of the hitherto observed zloty appreciation, which will also contribute to the decline in core inflation.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members this effect will be additionally supported by the limited demand and wage pressures.",
        "Those Council members also pointed out that, on the basis of the currently available data, no increases in certain taxes, including exercise duty, should be expected this year.",
        "Increases in those taxes were previously assessed as a risk factor for decline in inflation.",
        "Other Council members stressed that despite strong decline in economic growth, inflation in Poland continued at a relatively high level.",
        "While discussing the outlook for inflation in the medium term, some Council members emphasized that factors supporting low inflation would include: stable inflation expectations, relatively low production capacity utilization, possible tightening of fiscal policy resulting from the need to reduce public finance sector deficit and low demand pressure connected with a slow recovery in the global economy.",
        "Those Council members also pointed out that future decline in inflation was additionally signalled by continuously decreasing growth in M3 aggregate.",
        "Other Council members indicated, however, that higher inflation in the coming years might be driven by higher energy prices connected with further growth in oil prices.",
        "Those Council members argued that limited possibilities of increasing the supply of energy commodities justified the expectations of their price increases in response to the slowly rising demand in the global economy.",
        "At the same time – in the opinion of those Council members – attempts to increase the production of biofuels would also result in the rise of food commodity prices in the world markets.",
        "The Council discussed the outlook for inflation in the light of the results of the February NBP projection.",
        "It was pointed out that the central projection path, under the assumption of constant NBP interest rates, indicated a gradual rise in inflation from 2010 Q4 – above the upper limit for deviations from the inflation target at the end of 2012, with core inflation in the years 2011-2012 expected to continue markedly above 2.5%.",
        "Some Council members argued that headline inflation remaining below the inflation target until mid-2011 would be driven by a strong decline in the growth of food and energy prices, i.e.",
        "categories likely to be affected by shocks, whose forecasts might be subject to considerable error.",
        "In the opinion of those Council members higher than assumed in the projection might also be, on the one hand, the growth in unit labour costs and, on the other hand, growth in private consumption (according to the projection, the latter should remain markedly below the average level for the years 2000-2009).",
        "They assessed the situation in which until the end of the projection horizon the negative output gap widens as very unlikely.",
        "As a result, according to those Council members, inflation in the medium term may run above the central projection path.",
        "Other members of the Council argued, however, that different than assumed in the projection developments in zloty exchange rate may translate into more favourable than presented in the February projection assessment of risk for stabilizing inflation at the target in the medium term.",
        "The discussion at the Council’s meeting also focused on issues connected with Poland’s monetary integration with the euro area, including participation of the zloty in the Exchange Rate Mechanism II.",
        "The Council discussed the conditions to be fulfilled for Poland to join the euro area.",
        "The Council agreed that Poland should join the ERM II and the euro area at the earliest possible date, after meeting the necessary legal, economic and organisational conditions.",
        "While discussing the outlook for monetary policy in the coming months, some Council members emphasized that in line with the February projection the probability of inflation running in the medium term above the inflation target was higher than the probability of inflation running below the target which – in their opinion – justified signalling in the Information from the MPC meeting that the balance of risks for inflation might soon change.",
        "Other members of the Council argued, however, that the uncertainty related to macroeconomic developments in the global economy, and in particular, in the euro area, does not allow to assess clearly whether the risk for inflation in the medium term running above the inflation target had considerably increased.",
        "The Council assessed that the data on the economic situation in Poland and abroad released since its last meeting justified maintaining the interest rates unchanged at the current meeting.",
        "While considering the decisions on the NBP interest rates in the future, some Council members agreed that the expected rise in inflation in the years 2011-2012 might indicate the need of tightening of the monetary policy in 2010, although the timing of possible interest rate increases would depend on the current developments.",
        "Some Council members noted that further stabilization in the international financial markets might translate into a decline in risk premium accounted for in market interest rates, which – under constant NBP interest rates – would mean some easing of monetary conditions.",
        "In the opinion of other Council members too early tightening of monetary policy might, however, be conducive to an excessive appreciation of the zloty exchange rate.",
        "The Council kept the interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 3.50%, the lombard rate at 5.00%, the deposit rate at 2.00%, the rediscount rate at 3.75% and the discount rate at 4.00%.",
        "At the meeting the Monetary Policy Council discussed the outlook for economic growth and inflation, situation in the public finance sector and in the labour market, monetary and credit aggregates and the exchange rate of the zloty.",
        "While analysing the current situation in the real economy and the outlook for economic growth in Poland, fast growth in industrial output, retail sales and exports was pointed out.",
        "Some Council members argued that the data on the consumption of households in 2010 Q2 and retail sales indicated that the economic growth, which had so far been mainly reinforced by growing external demand, was increasingly supported by domestic factors.",
        "In their opinion the current consumption growth cannot be fully attributed to one-off factors such as rebuilding of assets in the areas affected by floods and transferring some purchases from 2011 in view of the expected change of VAT rates and changes in the regulations on VAT deduction on car purchases.",
        "In the opinion of those Council members, the improving labour market situation, including the relatively fast employment growth in the enterprise sector, would act towards further consumption growth.",
        "In turn, the strengthening private consumption amid further high export growth could translate into investment recovery in enterprises, even though due to the uncertainty surrounding the future economic situation, including the situation in the public finance sector, corporate investment growth in the quarters to come could remain low.",
        "Those members emphasised that the possibility of investment revival is suggested by an increase in production capacity utilisation above the long-run average and favourable financial and liquidity situation of enterprises, allowing them to self-finance investment.",
        "Moreover, in the opinion of those Council members, investment growth in the economy in the coming quarters – apart from the quickly growing public investment – might be also supported by housing market recovery, the symptoms of which appeared in 2010 Q3.",
        "Other Council members argued, however, that the incoming data did not unequivocally confirm that the recovery in economic activity was sustainable.",
        "They pointed out that some forecasts indicated the possibility of economic growth weakening in 2011 or stabilising at a relatively low level in the next two years.",
        "They also emphasised that retail sales growth was most likely being raised by the rapid increase in the sale of automobiles and durable goods, which was driven by one-off factors.",
        "After the expiry of the impact of these factors – in the opinion of those Council members – the growth of household consumption may slacken, which is confirmed by the low growth of real wages.",
        "Those members also pointed out that investment growth was still very low, and in the recent period the sentiment of enterprises had worsened, including their expectations on output, demand and employment.",
        "While discussing the outlook for inflation in Poland, the Council addressed the results of the inflation projection based on the NECMOD model and other forecasts.",
        "It was pointed out that, in line with the October projection, in its entire horizon the probability of inflation running above the NBP inflation target of 2.5% is higher than the probability of inflation running below this target.",
        "Other internal NBP forecasts also point to such distribution of those probabilities.",
        "The members of the Council pointed out that in the short term inflation would be driven by rising food prices, caused by supply-side shocks in the country and abroad, changes in indirect tax rates and the rise in administered prices, primarily energy prices.",
        "Some Council members assessed that inflation would also be raised by delayed effects of the strong depreciation of the zloty during the economic crisis, which could not yet fully translate into consumer prices in Poland.",
        "In the opinion of other Council members, inflation would be limited by factors such as zloty exchange rate appreciation observed in recent months, low inflation in the external environment of the Polish economy and still weak demand and wage pressure, including the positive development of the relationship between the growth of labour productivity and aggregate wages.",
        "Some Council members assessed, however, that taking into account a possible decline in the potential growth of the Polish economy as a result of the financial crisis and other factors, the current rate of economic growth was already relatively high and would not be a factor limiting the inflation rise in Poland.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members, after the expiry of factors temporarily raising inflation, in the absence of monetary policy tightening, inflation was likely to remain at an elevated level due to the expected increase in domestic wage and demand pressures, including a likely acceleration in unit labour cost growth and the inflation rise abroad.",
        "This is indicated by the forecast steady growth of core inflation net of food and energy prices in the projection based on the NECMOD model.",
        "Other Council members, however, assessed that inflationary pressures may be eased by an appreciation of the zloty and fiscal policy tightening in 2012 announced by the government.",
        "They also pointed out that inflation would decrease after the supply-side inflationary factors expire.",
        "Board members also discussed the situation of the public finance sector.",
        "Some members pointed out that the scale of the planned fiscal tightening in 2011 was not sufficient for curbing the public debt accumulation.",
        "Some Council members also indicated that due to the risk of lower than projected revenues from the VAT and lower income from privatisation in 2011, the scale of fiscal tightening and also the reduction of the borrowing needs of the central budget may prove smaller than assumed.",
        "Those members also pointed out that the revenues which would be reducing the borrowing needs of the central budget in 2011 were of one-off nature and would not curb the growth of public debt in the following years.",
        "Therefore, in order to halt the rapid public debt accumulation it would be necessary to increase the scale of fiscal tightening in the years to come.",
        "These members also emphasised that the likely lack of consent to deduct the cost of pension reform from the general government deficit would necessitate a strong fiscal tightening in the coming years in order to meet the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact.",
        "According to those members, the strong fiscal tightening would be a factor curbing economic growth and inflationary pressure in Poland.",
        "Some Council members, however, pointed to the uncertainty concerning the fiscal policy after 2011.",
        "Moreover, some Council members pointed out that, because of the possibility of the socalled non-Keynesian effects of fiscal tightening, such tightening does not have to significantly reduce the short-term economic growth if it is mainly based on the reduction of general government expenditure.",
        "If, however, it was based on indirect tax increases, then it would act towards a shortterm increase in inflation in Poland, rising the risk of inflation becoming entrenched at a heightened level.",
        "While discussing the situation in the external environment, the continued recovery of moderate growth in the global economy was emphasised, including the persistence of low GDP growth in major developed economies and a gradual decline in the growth of the Chinese economy as a result of macroeconomic policy tightening in this country.",
        "The effects of high fiscal imbalance and its planned reduction, as well as the effects of monetary expansion, including non-standard measures undertaken and envisaged by major central banks continue to be an important uncertainty factor for the global economic growth.",
        "Some Council members assessed that the decline in China’s economic growth could translate – through its adverse impact on the outlook for German exports – into a slowdown in the Polish exports.",
        "However, other Council members, assuming that the competitive exchange rate devaluations would not intensify and no collapse in the world trade should be anticipated, believed that the rapid growth in major emerging economies could be expected, which would support the relatively high demand for German and, indirectly, also for Polish exports.",
        "Some Council members pointed out that GDP growth rate in the euro area was now close to the growth rate of the economies of the United States and the United Kingdom, which had historically grown faster than the euro area.",
        "Those members argued that this may be associated with different economic policy responses to the financial crisis in those economies.",
        "In particular, they pointed out that the relatively rapid improvement of business sentiment in Germany during the recovery from the recession might have been supported by the fact that fiscal deficit had not been allowed to rise to a high level in Germany, which limited the risk of increased future tax burden in this country.",
        "Some Council members pointed out that – in view of the probably extended period of low interest rates being maintained by major central banks and the reintroduction of quantitative easing in the United States – a possible rise in interest rates of the NBP could increase the risk of rapid capital inflows and excessive appreciation of the zloty.",
        "In turn, other Council members believed that the potential rise in interest rate disparity could only have a limited impact on the zloty exchange rate path.",
        "They pointed out that the exchange rate of the zloty, similarly to the currencies of other emerging economies, was significantly affected by changes in risk perception by investors in global financial markets.",
        "Therefore, any appreciation of the zloty would most probably be accompanied by the appreciation of the currencies of other emerging economies, i.e.",
        "Poland’s competitors in international markets.",
        "Moreover, some Council members pointed out that the reintroduction of quantitative easing in the United States could also foster the appreciation of the euro against the dollar, which would have a beneficial influence on the relationship between the prices of Polish exports and imports.",
        "Some Council members also assessed that stabilisation of the share of non-residents’ investment in the domestic treasury bill markets in October 2010 might be a sign of certain curbing of the inflow of capital to this market, which reduced the probability of strong appreciation of the zloty exchange rate.",
        "Those members also emphasised that this share was currently at a relatively high level which might increase vulnerability of the zloty exchange rate to changes in the risk perception in the global markets.",
        "Some members of the Council also addressed changes in the external environment of the Polish economy driven by the financial crisis, which were likely to impact the developments of the equilibrium interest rate in Poland.",
        "They assessed that the possible decline in the potential growth of the Polish economy might not have been accompanied by a similar fall in the equilibrium interest rate in Poland due to the likely increase in the investment risk premium in the emerging economies (a decline in the current account deficit regarded as sustainable by investors).",
        "While analysing the situation in the labour market, it was pointed out that the rise in employment in the corporate sector accompanied by the simultaneous increase in the unemployment rate in September 2010 (in seasonally adjusted terms) continued, which might be driven by the persisting growth in the number of economically active persons, contributing to curbing the wage pressure.",
        "Some members of the Council also indicated that upon recovery from the current economic slowdown, employment started to rise amidst markedly lower GDP growth than in the past, which, coupled with growing number of economically active persons, might point at favourable structural changes in the Polish labour market in the past few years.",
        "It was also pointed at the stabilisation of the ratio of new job offers to the number of unemployed.",
        "At the same time, other Council members pointed at the uncertainty about the impact of the abolition of restrictions on Polish citizens accessing the labour market in Germany and Austria starting from May 2011 on the supply of labour in Poland, in particular, the number of highly qualified workers.",
        "Some members of the Council emphasised that amidst high percentage of enterprises where output had recently been increasing considerably faster than employment, the corporate sector might be expected to see further employment growth.",
        "Moreover they assessed that high wage restraint in the enterprises in the period of economic slowdown was rather a disturbance than a structural change that should fade off together with improvement in the economic situation.",
        "As a result, over the monetary policy transmission horizon, wage pressure in the economy may be expected to intensify.",
        "Members of the Council also discussed the developments of inflation expectations.",
        "It was argued that following a rise observed in August 2010, the subsequent months recorded a drop in the majority of measures of household inflation expectations which were currently at the level close to the NBP's inflation target.",
        "Council members pointed at a decline in the number of enterprises which, in the business condition surveys, declared increases of their own prices, despite the expected rise in the commodity prices.",
        "Yet, according to some Council members, basing on the historical data, the resulting decline in markups may be expected to have minor and quickly fading off impact on inflation.",
        "At the same time, Council members pointed at an increase of inflation expectations of enterprises and financial sector analysts concerning growth in prices in the whole economy.",
        "It was emphasised that the anticipated rise in VAT and excise tax did not result in any considerable increase in inflation expectations.",
        "Yet, some members of the Council pointed at a risk of a rise in inflation expectations at the beginning of 2011, following the implementation of the announced changes in the indirect taxes rates.",
        "The meeting also discussed the developments of monetary aggregates.",
        "Council members pointed at the continuation of a relatively stable M3 supply growth, declining annual growth in household lending and persistently negative, albeit gradually rising annual growth in corporate lending[1].",
        "It was emphasised that corporate demand for credit remained weak, and debt increase in the banking sector concerned mainly large enterprises; on the other hand, no clear revival in lending to the sector of small and medium-sized enterprises could be seen.",
        "In the opinion of some members of the Council, the currently observed moderate growth in monetary aggregates did not point at a risk of growing inflationary pressure.",
        "Other members of the Council emphasised, however, that M3 growth was not low when compared to the growth of nominal GDP.",
        "Those members paid particular attention to the developments in housing loans, which increase more substantially than other categories of loans to households and enterprises.",
        "Those members pointed out that given the decline in the interest on mortgage loans as a result of reduction of bank markups and banks' expectations of rising demand for those loans, a further acceleration might be expected in the growth of housing loans which already exceeded the achievable growth of disposable income.",
        "While considering the decision on interest rates, some members of the Council argued that the expected acceleration of economic growth supporting the improvement in labour market situation may – in the absence of monetary policy tightening – lead to a gradual rise in wage and inflationary pressure in the medium term.",
        "Those members of the Council claimed that the NBP interest rate increase would be justified in order to reduce the risk of the emergence of such pressure.",
        "Such an increase would constitute an adjustment of monetary policy parameters to the current assessment of economic situation following the period of a strong decline in economic activity caused by the global financial crisis.",
        "It would be also conducive to anchoring the inflation expectations at the level of the NBP’s inflation target.",
        "In the opinion of other members of the Council, the persistently moderate economic growth in Poland, currently low wage and demand pressure (confirmed by core inflation running at a low level) and the possibility of increasing inflow of capital to emerging economies, including Poland, amidst the extended period of expansionary monetary policy pursued by major central banks, combined with the risk of further slowdown of the global economic growth, justified keeping the NBP interest rates unchanged at the present meeting of the Council.",
        "Those members also 1 Adjusted for exchange rate changes.",
        "emphasised that growing interest rate disparity combined with the appreciation of the exchange rate could support the increase in foreign currency lending.",
        "The meeting also discussed a rise in the required reserve rate by 50 basis points.",
        "Some members of the Council pointed out that the required reserve rate was reduced as part of the anti-crisis measures undertaken in the period of strong liquidity disturbances in the financial markets.",
        "As this period ended, it was justified to increase this rate to the level maintained before the financial crisis.",
        "Such a decision would also constitute a signal of MPC’s readiness to react to increasing inflationary pressure.",
        "Other members of the Council emphasised, however, that a rise in the required reserve rate would have a limited impact on the liquidity in the domestic money market and would not be a factor likely to translate into limiting the inflationary pressure in the economy.",
        "At the same time, they pointed out that a rise in reserve rate is not the best signal of MPC’s readiness to react to growing inflationary pressure.",
        "A motion to raise the required reserve rate by 50 basis points from 3.0% to 3.5% was put forward at the meeting.",
        "The decision applies to reserve requirement to be held from 31 December 2010.",
        "Also a motion to raise the NBP interest rates by 50 basis points was put forward at the meeting.",
        "The motion did not pass.",
        "The Council kept the interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 3.50%, the lombard rate at 5.00%, the deposit rate at 2.00%, the rediscount rate at 3.75% and the discount rate at 4.00%.",
        "At the meeting, the Monetary Policy Council discussed issues related to developments in the external environment of the Polish economy, the outlook for domestic economic growth and inflation, and the situation in the public finance sector.",
        "While addressing the external developments it was pointed out that the recovery in the global economy continued, with a slight acceleration of GDP growth in 2010 Q3 in the United States and slower GDP growth in the euro area.",
        "At the same time, a deepening divergence in the economic situation among EU Member States was stressed, in particular, favourable economic conditions observed in Germany, Great Britain and France, the main recipients of Polish exports, contrasted with the intensification of problems in the EU peripheral countries.",
        "Some Council members emphasized that positive economic developments in major trading partners of Central and Eastern European countries translated into higher economic growth forecasts for those countries, including Poland.",
        "Members of the Council pointed out that tensions connected with the deep fiscal imbalance gradually spread to other countries and in the future might affect major developed economies.",
        "In this context it was argued that further turmoil in the financial markets is possible, which might limit the scale of the capital inflow to the emerging economies, including to Poland.",
        "At the same time some Council members emphasized that the necessary reduction of the fiscal imbalance in the euro area countries in the short term would contribute to the decline of GDP growth in those countries.",
        "Other members of the Council pointed to the possibility of non-Keynesian effects of the planned fiscal tightening in the euro area countries.",
        "Some members of the Council indicated that the expansionary monetary policy, including nonstandard measures undertaken by major central banks, coupled with improved sentiment in the financial markets contributed to a strong rise in commodity prices in the global markets, thus intensifying long-term tendencies.",
        "This, in turn, boosted the cost pressure and thereby also inflationary pressure in the emerging economies, which translated into high PPI growth in Central and Eastern European countries, including Poland.",
        "In the longer term, the expansionary monetary policy and long-term upward trends in commodity prices might lead to an inflation rise also in the developed economies.",
        "Those Council members argued that those conditions should be taken into account in the conduct of monetary policy.",
        "In particular, monetary policy should take into account that the growing demand for commodities from developing countries would support further rises in their prices in the medium and long term.",
        "Other members of the Council reasoned that the rise in the world prices would be a factor beyond the impact of the monetary policy conducted by central banks of countries regarded as small open economies.",
        "Members of the Council pointed to a gradual acceleration of economic growth in Poland which in 2010 Q3 exceeded expectations.",
        "Yet, some Council members assessed that subsequent quarters were not likely to witness a marked increase in economic growth which was indicated by the lack of significant improvement in leading indicators of business sentiment.",
        "GDP growth might also be curbed by the announced tightening of the fiscal policy.",
        "Those Council members emphasized that there was persistent uncertainty about the sustainability of GDP growth acceleration, connected with a possible weakening of households’ consumption growth at the beginning of 2011, when factors which strengthened it on a temporary basis would fade away.",
        "Yet, other members of the Council assessed that factors weakening consumption growth would be offset by a gradual improvement in the labour market situation, including growing employment, which would have a positive impact on the consumer sentiment.",
        "Among the factors increasing the uncertainty about the sustainability of economic growth acceleration some members of the Council mentioned the hitherto observed absence of recovery in corporate investment.",
        "They pointed out that the investment activity of enterprises might be curbed by the uncertainty about the situation in the external environment of the Polish economy, limited lending, relatively high fiscal burden, as well as by administrative and legal barriers.",
        "However, other members of the Council pointed out that the level of production capacity utilization in the economy had been growing steadily and at that time slightly exceeded the long-term average which should support the recovery in investment demand.",
        "The good liquidity situation of enterprises, especially large ones that invest more than small and medium-sized companies, may also be a factor contributing to a rise in investment.",
        "While addressing inflation, some members of the Council emphasized that although CPI inflation declined slightly in November 2010 it was still running above the inflation target of 2.5%.",
        "Moreover, due to a rise in the majority of VAT rates and an increase in the prices of energy the coming months may be expected to bring a rise in inflation.",
        "While analyzing the risk that heightened inflation persists those members of the Council pointed out that this risk was enhanced by the gradually increasing GDP growth which, in their opinion, was likely to exceed potential output growth in the subsequent quarters.",
        "According to those members of the Council, a factor which, on the one hand, boosts demand and, on the other hand, is likely to weaken potential output growth are zloty exchange rate developments.",
        "Some Council members also pointed out that heightened inflation might be supported by adaptive inflation expectations.",
        "Other members of the Council argued that the hitherto observed rise in inflation was mainly driven by supply-side factors, that are to a large extent beyond the impact of monetary policy.",
        "In the opinion of those Council members, the absence of a clear demand pressure is indicated by the still low and stable level of core inflation net of food and energy prices.",
        "Those members also emphasized that the moderate scale of the expected inflation rise in the coming quarters would reduce the risk that heightened inflation persists.",
        "While discussing the situation in the labour market, some members of the Council indicated that the still low wage growth and relatively high unemployment rate – driven, among other things, by a rise in economic activity – would limit the rise in wage pressure, and, in consequence, also inflationary pressure.",
        "Those members pointed out that according to the results of the NBP's survey there was a considerable decline in the number of the employed who are to benefit from wage increases in 2011 Q1.",
        "Yet, other members of the Council argued that due to the growing number of the long-term unemployed the high level of unemployment rate will curb wage growth to an ever lesser extent.",
        "Some members of the Council also emphasized that the impact of the opening of the labour market in Germany and Austria to Polish citizens in mid-2011 remains an important uncertainty factor with respect to the size of the labour supply.",
        "Other members of the Council indicated that as the differences in wages offered in Poland and abroad shrank, incentives to economic migration became weaker and, as a result, the opening of the German and the Austrian labour markets should not result in a considerable outflow of labour from Poland; it should rather lead to the legalization of employment of Poles already working in Germany and Austria.",
        "While addressing bank lending, some members of the Council pointed out that monthly increases in housing loans to households were close to the ones observed during the credit boom of 2007-2008, and the annual growth in those loans markedly exceeded disposable income growth considered neutral with respect to the risk of rising inflation.",
        "Moreover, in the opinion of those Council members, the acceleration in economic growth increased the risk of excessive lending growth in the future as, on the one hand, it encourages banks to ease their lending conditions and, on the other hand, it results in increasing private sector demand for credit.",
        "Other members of the Council emphasized that the increase in lending to enterprises remained very limited, and a significant increase of irregular loans in banks' portfolio might urge banks to tighten their lending policies, which would counteract the revival in lending.",
        "It was also pointed out that the availability of foreign currency loans to households was very important for the efficiency of the domestic monetary policy.",
        "While analyzing the situation in the public finance sector, some Council members pointed out that the scale of the planned fiscal tightening in Poland in 2011-2012 was lower than in other European countries with a similar level of the public finance deficit.",
        "In the opinion of those Council members, amidst high borrowing needs of many countries, this may have a negative impact on Poland's ability to raise funds from foreign investors to finance public debt.",
        "Other members of the Council assessed that the scale of fiscal tightening in Poland in 2011 would not be lower than in the majority of European countries.",
        "Some members of the Council emphasized that apart from a limited reduction of the fiscal imbalance in Poland, also a possible change in the rules of allocating old-age pension contributions between the repartition and the capital funded part of the pension system might contribute to deterioration in investor confidence, increasing, as a result, the volatility of the zloty exchange rate and of financial instruments prices.",
        "Yet, other Council members assessed that introducing changes to the pension system might improve the credibility of the Polish economy.",
        "While discussing the level of interest rates in the Polish economy some Council members indicated that the risk of inflation running above the NBP inflation target in the medium term, which increases along with the gradual acceleration of economic growth, justified starting the cycle of gradual tightening of the monetary policy at the current meeting.",
        "Those Council members also argued that increasing interest rates before the expected inflation rise would support the stabilization of inflation expectations of economic agents.",
        "At the same time some members of the Council emphasized that the lower than in the past zloty exchange rate sensitivity to the interest rate differential raises the costs of a possible too late a reaction of the central bank to the inflationary pressure.",
        "Other members of the Council pointed out that wage and demand pressures continued to be limited, there were no signs of revival in lending and the hitherto observed and expected in the short term rise in inflation resulted mainly from factors beyond the impact of monetary policy.",
        "In the opinion of those Council members those arguments justified keeping the NBP interest rates unchanged.",
        "At the same time, some of those members of the Council emphasized that a rise in economic growth increasing the risk of inflation continuing above the inflation target in the medium term might require monetary policy tightening in near future.",
        "Yet, gradual increasing of the NBP interest rates should start after some improvement in the financial market sentiment.",
        "A motion to raise the NBP interest rates by 25 basis points was put forward at the meeting.",
        "The motion did not pass.",
        "The Council kept the interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 3.50%, the lombard rate at 5.00%, the deposit rate at 2.00%, the rediscount rate at 3.75% and the discount rate at 4.00%.",
        "During its meeting the Monetary Policy Council discussed primarily the situation in the external environment of the Polish economy, including the possible consequences of the fiscal crisis in Greece, and the outlook for economic growth and inflation in Poland.",
        "While addressing the situation abroad, it was pointed out that the economic activity abroad was gradually rising, although the scale of the recovery varied strongly between the regions.",
        "It was indicated that in March – for the first time since the beginning of the recession brought about by the financial crisis – a marked rise in employment in the United States was observed, which further boosted consumer demand in that economy.",
        "At the same time, it was emphasised that further improvement in the labour market would be achieved gradually.",
        "Moreover, it was assessed that the persistently limited scale of lending in the United States contributed to curbing demand in this economy in the months to come.",
        "In the discussion about the euro area some members of the Council pointed at further increase in industrial output and improvement in business confidence indicators.",
        "Those members pointed out that rapid economic growth in the developing Asian countries leads to growing demand of these countries for euro area exports, thus contributing to GDP growth in the euro area.",
        "Other members of the Council emphasised, however, that the revival in the economic activity in the euro area was significantly weaker than in the United States, whereas, in the opinion of some Council members, this was mostly the effect of a relatively larger scale of fiscal and monetary expansion in the US economy in the preceding period.",
        "Those members also pointed out that the persistently unfavourable situation in the euro area labour market contributed to curbing consumer demand, which was reflected in the decline in retail sales in the first months of 2010.",
        "Yet, it was emphasised that unfavourable weather conditions were also an important factor behind this decline.",
        "The Council paid much attention to the fiscal situation in the major developed economies.",
        "It was assessed that public debt accumulation in the United States and in the euro area, being the effect of the previously introduced stimulus packages, constituted the main risk factor for their economic growth.",
        "On the one hand, reduction of budget deficits, although likely to support economic growth in the longer run, could lead to another decline in activity in those economies in the short run.",
        "On the other hand, maintenance of the loose fiscal policy would be a factor limiting economic growth due to the ensuing increase in long-term interest rates.",
        "While addressing the situation in Greece, some members of the Council pointed out that the fiscal crisis in that country would trigger tensions in the international financial markets and a rise in the market interest rates also in other economies, in particular, in the euro area countries with distinctly strong fiscal imbalances.",
        "The differences in the public finance situation and in capacity for its improvement amplify the diversity in the outlook for growth in particular euro area economies.",
        "In the opinion of those Council members, a contingent insolvency of the Greek government would entail losses for financial institutions operating in Europe that hold Greek government securities, which might contribute to a repeated limited access of European enterprises to bank credit.",
        "This would also significantly increase agents’ uncertainty about the future economic situation, leading to  Warszawa ul Świętokrzy ska  (22)  51 a decline in the economic activity.",
        "At the same time, some members of the Council argued that although granting financial aid to Greece by other euro area countries would mitigate the current crisis, it might, in the longer run, translate into a decline in the confidence of financial market participants in the fiscal policy pursued in the euro area countries.",
        "This would, in turn, on the one hand, contribute to a rise in the market interest rates in those economies, and, on the other hand, weaken the euro exchange rate and increase the volatility of exchange rates of other currencies, including the zloty.",
        "While analysing the situation in the Polish economy, a slight upward revision of GDP in 2009 Q4 and better than expected data on industrial output and retail sales were indicated.",
        "It was also stressed that economic recovery was observed mainly in industry.",
        "Some members of the Council pointed out that in March 2010 the sold production of industry reached higher level than before the economic slowdown, and its growth in the recent period was observed in the majority of the sections.",
        "They emphasised the improvement in enterprises’ expectations about their economic situation and future demand as well as the fact that, although economic recovery had not translated yet into a rise in corporate investment activity, a higher than in the previous quarters percentage of firms surveyed by the NBP continued the already started investment projects.",
        "Those members also emphasised that the change in inventories might have a positive contribution to GDP growth in the subsequent quarters, which was signalled by a decreasing percentage of the surveyed enterprises reporting excessive levels of inventories of finished products and by an increasing percentage of firms assessing their inventory levels as too low.",
        "Yet, other members of the Council pointed at the deepening decline in the annual growth of corporate investment in 2009 Q4 as well as the decline in construction and assembly output and still low growth of retail sales in the whole of 2010 Q1.",
        "The Council also emphasised that the outlook for economic growth in Poland depended largely on the developments in the external environment, including the way the fiscal crisis in Greece will be contained and the fiscal problems of other economies solved.",
        "Some members of the Council argued that the possible persistence of weak economic activity in the euro area, which is Poland’s main trading partner, would limit the growth in Polish exports, thus slowing down GDP growth.",
        "Other members of the Council pointed out that – despite low economic activity in the euro area – in the past months Polish exports increased steadily, which was driven by the growing demand of Asian countries for European goods, produced with the use of Polish intermediate goods.",
        "They also pointed out that in the light of the NBP surveys, the situation of Polish exporters was improving and profitability of exports was high despite the appreciation of the zloty.",
        "While discussing the situation in the labour market, it was emphasised that the data for March 2010 signalled possible deceleration of unfavourable tendencies in that market: acceleration in the annual wage growth and some stabilisation of employment in the enterprise sector, stabilisation of the employment rate (adjusted for seasonal factors) and a rise in the number of new job offers.",
        "Some Council members argued that a certain improvement in the labour market situation in 2010 Q1 was also indicated by the results of NBP survey studies of enterprises which pointed to a probable acceleration of wage growth in the following quarter.",
        "Other members of the Council assessed that the situation in the labour market will be improving only gradually and the improvement may not occur in some sectors of the economy, particularly construction.",
        "In the discussion about current inflation it was pointed out that in March 2010 the annual CPI inflation fell to a level close to the NBP inflation target; all measures of core inflation and the HICP had also declined, while the PPI remained negative.",
        "Some Council members, however, argued that the decline in CPI inflation in March was largely driven by lower annual growth of the prices of food and Internet services, which – according to these Council members – are not sensitive to shifts in demand pressure.",
        "In this context, they assessed that demand pressure might be better reflected by the growth of prices in the category restaurant and hotel services which remains relatively high.",
        "Those members also pointed out that Poland had not complied with the Maastricht price stability criterion for many months.",
        "While analysing the outlook for inflation, some members of the Council pointed out that in line with the available forecasts the CPI inflation in the coming months would be running below the NBP inflation target.",
        "This would primarily result from a moderate demand pressure reflected in low production capacity utilisation, recently observed zloty appreciation and low growth of labour costs in the economy, including their decline in industry.",
        "In the opinion of those Council members, demand pressure should be curbed by a relatively high unemployment rate and low growth of lending to the private sector, including in particular the decline in loans granted to enterprises.",
        "At the same time, it was assessed that inflation decline may be limited by rises in commodity prices in the world markets (though this effect may be offset by the so-far zloty appreciation) and by the persistently elevated growth of some administered prices.",
        "Other members of the Council assessed that the scenario of the annual CPI inflation running markedly below the inflation target for an extended period was rather improbable as the recovery in the Polish economy and an improvement in the labour market situation (which was probable in the light of the latest data), including in particular a possible acceleration of wage growth, will lead to a gradual build-up of demand and cost pressures.",
        "They argued that a decline in unit labour costs was typical of the current phase of the business cycle and it may be expected that further recovery in the economic activity would be accompanied by their faster growth.",
        "Moreover, in view of those Council members, the drop in lending to enterprises may be reflecting low credit needs on the part of companies due to their good financial situation.",
        "It was emphasised, however, that in the assessment of banks the decline in the demand for credit mainly applied to large enterprises, while the demand of small and medium-sized enterprises was rising.",
        "Some Council members pointed to the data on industry which indicated that in comparison to the situation before the economic slowdown the highest increase in output was recorded in the case of consumer goods.",
        "In view of those Council members, this may suggest that the utilisation of production capacity in enterprises producing consumer goods was higher than in the industrial sector on average, which may be relevant for the assessment of the future price growth of those goods.",
        "Other members of the Council, however, emphasised that consumer goods were internationally tradable goods, which should be curbing their price growth even amid high utilisation of production capacity in their producers.",
        "The members of the Council also referred to the unfavourable public finance situation.",
        "It was pointed out that the loose fiscal policy was contributing, through the large issue of Treasury securities, to increased involvement of non-residents in the bond market.",
        "This raises the vulnerability of the Polish economy to a possible turmoil in the global financial markets leading to capital outflows from emerging market economies.",
        "Some Council members assessed that in the event of no public finance consolidation the costs of financing the public debt would continue to rise due to, among others, a possible ensuing increase in the inflation expectations of economic agents.",
        "They also pointed out that the yields on Treasury securities in Poland were currently higher then in some other countries of the region.",
        "Other members of the Council believed that the current fiscal imbalance did not pose a direct risk of higher inflation amid the currently low inflation pressure, though they shared the opinion that the continuation of such imbalance in the longer term would be a factor limiting the GDP growth.",
        "While addressing the exchange rate issues, some Council members assessed that zloty exchange rate developments might have been affected by expectations of future changes in the interest rate disparity between Poland and the euro area.",
        "Other members of the Council, however, argued that changes in zloty exchange rate were to a large extent driven by factors other than the current and expected interest rate disparity, including in particular shifts in the sentiment in the global financial markets.",
        "The Council assessed that the low inflationary pressure over the monetary policy transmission horizon and the uncertainty as to the impact of the situation in the external environment on the outlook for economic growth in Poland justified keeping the NBP interest rates unchanged at the current meeting.",
        "The Council kept the interest rates unchanged: the reference rate stands at 3.50%, the lombard rate at 5.00%, the deposit rate at 2.00%, the rediscount rate at 3.75% and the discount rate at 4.00%.",
        "At the meeting, the Monetary Policy Council discussed the outlook for economic growth and inflation, the situation in the labour market, monetary and credit aggregates and the zloty exchange rate developments.",
        "The Council emphasised further recovery of economic activity in Poland, which will most likely continue in the quarters to come.",
        "Some Council members pointed to the fact that international institutions had increased their forecasts of Poland’s GDP growth for 2011.",
        "These members stressed that GDP growth was increasingly supported by domestic factors, in particular by individual consumption growth, which is encouraged by the improving labour market situation.",
        "They also pointed to the relatively high level of production capacity utilisation, which should translate into revival of enterprises’ investment demand, particularly considering their very good financial situation.",
        "The continuation of high – in their assessment – GDP growth in the coming quarters should be additionally supported by the favourable outlook for exports, connected in particular with high economic activity in Germany and a fast increase in German exports.",
        "In the opinion of those Council members, in 2011 no significant demand reduction should be expected on the part of the public finance sector in Poland.",
        "On the other hand, other Council members argued that there was still a risk of a slowdown in the global economic growth, and that domestic demand was dependent on consumer sentiment, which had once again slightly deteriorated in November, and on the level of public investment, which could be delayed.",
        "In the opinion of those Council members, the postponement of public investment and the reduction of other expenditure of the public finance sector, in combination with a possible further increase in taxes, would also result from a necessary fiscal policy tightening in 2011, which in the short run would be slowing GDP growth.",
        "Moreover, some Council members pointed out that without a significant recovery in investment loans, it would be impossible to boost corporate investment.",
        "While discussing the situation in the labour market, some Council members emphasised that the growth in the number of economically active persons meant that in the recent months the rising employment had not been matched by a declining rate of unemployment, which resulted in the fact that the level of labour market tensions was not growing, and wage pressure remained limited.",
        "The absence of significant wage pressure was also confirmed – in their opinion – by the data on wages in the economy, whose growth in 2010 Q3 was low.",
        "Other Council members, however, argued that a further increase in employment in the enterprise sector, combined with the growing number of job offers, signalled a revival in the labour market, which could contribute to a gradual build-up of wage pressure.",
        "According to those Council members, the very good financial results of companies could be conducive to accelerated wage growth, particularly in the state-controlled companies of the raw material sector.",
        "Some Council members continued to indicate that the opening of the German and Austrian labour markets in May 2011 constitute an uncertainty factor for the development of the labour supply in Poland.",
        "Some Council members emphasised that developments in the labour market, including the amount of labour supply, would also depend on changes in the tax and pension policy.",
        "While discussing changes in credit aggregates, it was indicated that the slight slowdown in the growth of loans to households (resulting largely from the gradual implementation of Recommendation T) was accompanied by continued low growth of lending to the corporate sector.",
        "At the same time, some Council members noted that, taking into account the increasing percentage of irregular loans, banks would not be willing to ease their lending policies.",
        "This should reduce the risk of excessive credit expansion and asset price rises, as well as of the increase of inflationary pressures.",
        "According to these Council members, the limited risk of excessive inflationary pressure was also indicated by the decelerated growth of monetary aggregates over the recent period.",
        "Other Council members argued that the monthly increases in housing loans to households remained at a relatively high level (lower only to that in 2007-2008), while loans to companies had been steadily rising for several months.",
        "These Council members believe that the expected acceleration of GDP growth may be supporting an accelerated credit growth – on the one hand, by strengthening the private sector demand for credit and, on the other hand, by encouraging banks to ease their lending conditions.",
        "They pointed out that the decline in the growth of money supply in October had been due to the base effect resulting from an increased demand for short-term credit in October 2009 fuelled by the privatisation of PGE.",
        "While analysing the rise in CPI inflation in October 2010 to 2.8%, it was pointed out that it had resulted from higher growth of energy and food prices, i.e.",
        "factors largely beyond the influence of monetary policy.",
        "Some Council members emphasised the fact that core inflation net of food and energy prices remained low, while some forecasts indicated that, after a temporary increase, CPI inflation would decline in the second half of 2011.",
        "Other members of the Council pointed out that other measures of core inflation had risen and the subsequent months could also bring an increase in core inflation net of food and energy prices.",
        "Moreover, those members argued that the increase in food and energy prices could not be considered temporary.",
        "In their assessment, it resulted largely from the impact of global factors (i.e.",
        "from a strong increase in commodity prices in the world markets associated with rising demand from the emerging economies).",
        "These factors could support high growth of prices of those goods also in the future.",
        "The Council also discussed about inflation expectations and the risk of second-round effects.",
        "Some Council members argued that inflation expectations in Poland were to a large extent adaptive, so the rise in current inflation would translate to higher inflation expectations, increasing the risk of second-round effects.",
        "Expectations can also be raised by the growing prices of frequently purchased goods, and also the increase of most VAT rates in 2011.",
        "Other Council members assessed that the risk of the growing inflation expectations translating into wage growth was small, since trade unions had little power in the Polish economy.",
        "They also emphasised that the growth of unit labour costs was still low, which meant that due to increasing labour productivity a possible acceleration of wage growth would have only limited impact on inflation.",
        "While analysing the impact of external conditions on the outlook for economic growth and inflation in Poland, some Council members pointed to the relatively high economic growth in the world, including the continued recovery in developed countries and a high growth of GDP in developing countries.",
        "According to these members of the Council, the growing activity in the global economy would support acceleration of GDP growth in Poland and maintaining high growth of commodity prices in the world markets in the years to come – translating into a rise in domestic inflationary pressures.",
        "Some Council members emphasised in particular the relatively favourable situation in Germany, which, through the positive impact on Polish exports and GDP growth, could also be conducive to a gradual rise in domestic inflationary pressure.",
        "Other Council members pointed out that activity in the German economy was heavily dependent on GDP growth in China, which was tightening its macroeconomic policies, which would be conducive to reducing Chinese economic growth.",
        "At the same time, Council members emphasised that an important uncertainty factor for the global economic growth remained the difficult fiscal situation of some euro-area countries and the effects of further expansionary fiscal and monetary policy in the United States, as well as tensions between the governments of the world’s largest economies related to the exchange rate policies.",
        "While discussing the changes in the external environment of the Polish economy which are likely to impact the developments of the exchange rate of the Polish zloty, members of the Council pointed, on the one hand, at the Fed’s decision on increasing the scale of monetary expansion, and, on the other hand, at the deepening of budgetary problems in Ireland.",
        "Some Council members emphasized at this point that response of financial markets to both events was weaker than to similar developments observed previously.",
        "This may indicate that any further turmoil connected with the situation in some euro-area countries would have a limited impact on the investors’ sentiment in the global financial markets.",
        "Some members of the Council argued, at the same time, that developments of the zloty exchange rate might be driven not only by external factors but also by domestic ones, especially by the size of the issue of treasury securities.",
        "Those members indicated that gradual reduction of the inflow of portfolio investments to Poland in the recent period could have been caused by a decrease in the issue of new bonds, resulting from satisfying the country’s borrowing needs for 2010.",
        "While addressing the impact of the domestic monetary policy on the zloty exchange rate amidst extended period of monetary expansion of major central banks, some members of the Council emphasized that importance of a possible rise in interest rate disparity might be limited due to growing – as a result of the crisis – role of changes in the global risk aversion to exchange rate developments.",
        "In the opinion of those Council members lower responsiveness of the exchange rate to changes in the disparity is a factor speaking in favour of tightening monetary policy in Poland as soon as possible.",
        "Those members also argued that a possible appreciation of the zloty would be most likely accompanied by the appreciation of currencies of other emerging economies.",
        "They pointed out that that the risk of the zloty appreciation being stronger than that of other emerging currencies was limited by high deficit in public finance sector in Poland.",
        "Other members of the Council emphasized that developments of the zloty exchange rate were an important factor affecting – together with the level of interest rates – the total restrictiveness of monetary conditions and thus they should be taken into consideration in the conduct of the monetary policy.",
        "During the meeting, members of the Council also discussed about possible changes in the potential output growth of the Polish economy.",
        "Some members of the Council emphasized that regardless of changes in the potential output growth, two factors – on the one hand, a decline in the current account deficit considered safe by financial market participants, and, on the other hand, rising deficit in public finance – could support a possible increase of the equilibrium interest rate.",
        "Other members of the Council indicated that high level of liquidity in the global financial markets could support a possible decrease in the equilibrium interest rate.",
        "The Council also discussed the balance of costs of a too late and too early tightening of the monetary policy.",
        "While considering the decision on interest rates, some members of the Council assessed that the risk of growing wage and inflationary pressure connected with accelerating GDP growth and the risk of growing inflation expectations justified increasing the NBP interest rates.",
        "In their opinion, an increase of interest rates by 50 basis points could constitute a one-off adjustment of monetary policy parameters to the current economic situation, following a period of a strong economic slowdown caused by the global financial crisis.",
        "On the other hand, an increase of interest rates by 25 basis points could start a gradual tightening of the monetary policy, whose scale and pace would depend on the economic developments in the coming quarters.",
        "In the opinion of the majority of Council members, the absence of a significant wage and inflationary pressures, persistently weak demand pressure and limited lending justified keeping the NBP interest rates unchanged in November.",
        "In the opinion of those members of the Council the persisting risk of excessive zloty appreciation connected with a strong monetary expansion in major developed economies as well as uncertainty related to economic developments abroad spoke also in favour of keeping the interest rates unchanged.",
        "A motion to raise the NBP interest rates by 50 basis points was put forward at the meeting.",
        "The motion did not pass.",
        "Also a motion to raise the NBP interest rates by 25 basis points was put forward at the meeting.",
        "The motion did not pass.",
        "The Council kept the interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 3.50%, the lombard rate at 5.00%, the deposit rate at 2.00%, the rediscount rate at 3.75% and the discount rate at 4.00%.",
        "During its meeting the Monetary Policy Council discussed issues related to economic growth and inflation, situation in the labour market and in the public finance sector, changes in monetary and credit aggregates and developments in the zloty exchange rate.",
        "While considering external conditions the Council members pointed to the continuation of moderate economic activity abroad.",
        "It was emphasised that after strong GDP growth observed in the euro area in 2010 Q2, the pace of recovery in this economy would most probably decelerate slightly.",
        "It was indicated that the recent period saw a deterioration in the outlook for GDP growth in the United States, even though it was assessed that the risk of a double dip in the US economy was rather low.",
        "Some members of the Council pointed out that economic growth abroad was to a large extent associated with stimulus packages and that the persisting uncertainty as to the sustainability of the recovery was urging central banks in the largest developed economies to continue with expansionary monetary policy.",
        "Other Council members emphasised that the weakening of GDP growth in developed economies was consistent with the expected lower potential output growth in those economies following the financial crisis.",
        "They pointed out that this weakening was also driven by a deep fiscal imbalance and the ensuing uncertainty as to the outcome of economic decisions.",
        "Those Council members also claimed that the effects of expansionary monetary policy, including the effects of unconventional measures undertaken and envisaged by the major central banks, are another important uncertainty factor for global economic growth and inflation.",
        "While discussing the outlook for economic activity in Poland, some Council members assessed that both the available forecasts and the incoming data, including data on GDP in 2010 Q2 and on industrial output and retail sales in 2010 Q3, suggested that GDP continued on an upward trend.",
        "Those members assessed that the economic growth expected in the coming quarters, even though low in relation to the period before the global financial crisis, will be relatively strong as compared to the potential output growth that was lowered – in their opinion – due to the crisis.",
        "Other Council members argued that GDP in Poland had been positively affected by stimulation packages introduced in other countries that are currently expiring and they assessed that economic growth would remain moderate.",
        "At the same time, these Council members pointed to the worsening business tendency indicators.",
        "While addressing the outlook for consumption growth, some deterioration in consumer sentiment indicators over the recent period was emphasised.",
        "Some members of the Council argued that this was to a large extent connected with the worsening assessment of the overall economic situation in the country and, to a lesser degree, with the worsening assessment of the financial standing of households, which meant – in the opinion of those Council members – that the deterioration of consumers’ sentiment did not unequivocally signal a gloomy outlook for consumption growth.",
        "They pointed to the positive impact of the improving situation in the labour market on the future consumption growth.",
        "Other Council members stressed that the good data on consumption in Q2 and retail sales in Q3 might have resulted from a transitory rise in demand connected with the replacement of durable goods in the areas affected by floods, increased car purchasing due to the  Warszawa ul Świętokrzy ska  (22)  51 abolition of VAT discounts on the purchase of cars with goods vehicle approval certificates which is scheduled for the end of 2010 and the transfer of some expenses related to the VAT rate increase to be introduced at the beginning of 2011.",
        "The Council paid considerable attention to the prospects of investment growth.",
        "It was argued that the level of production capacity utilisation had once again increased in 2010 Q3, which in combination with the very good financial results of enterprises in the first half of 2010 should support the revival of investment activity.",
        "In turn, the persisting uncertainty about future demand is likely to deter enterprises from expanding their production capacity, even though – according to some Council members – the relative importance of this factor will be rather decreasing in relation to the effect of rising production capacity utilisation and the very good financial situation of enterprises.",
        "At the same time, those members emphasised that the rapidly growing revenue from exports could be conducive to boosting investment of exporters.",
        "The possibility of such a revival is supported by NBP analyses which suggest that in Q2 the negative investment growth had been halted in this group of companies.",
        "Other Council members emphasised that GUS data on investment activity of enterprises had not confirmed so far any investment recovery.",
        "While referring to the labour market situation, it was pointed out that the number of the employed in the economy increased in 2010 Q2 and employment in the enterprise sector continued to rise gradually in Q3.",
        "On this occasion, some Council members emphasised that, due to the limited scale of redundancies in 2008-2009, the number of the employed in the economy was close to the level recorded in the period before the economic slowdown.",
        "At the same time, the average monthly employment increases in the enterprise sector range at a relatively high level, lower only to that in 2007.",
        "Some Council members pointed out that rising employment was accompanied by increases in the number of the economically active, which weakened tensions in the labour market and the rise of wage pressure.",
        "Other Council members, however, argued that a further increase in labour supply was likely to be constrained by demographic factors which decelerated the growth of working-age population.",
        "Some Council members pointed out that an additional factor that could adversely affect the supply of labour in Poland was the abolition of restrictions on Polish citizens in accessing the labour market in Germany and Austria starting from May 2011.",
        "Some Council members argued that the current wage increase was not large, and that the NBP economic climate survey showed that the percentage of enterprises planning to raise wages remained moderate, which might be indicative of wage discipline being maintained in the enterprise sector.",
        "Other Council members stressed that the percentage of employees who, according to declarations of companies, were to be covered by pay rises in Q4 approached its long-term average.",
        "Those members assessed that the dampening effect of low growth of unit labour costs on inflation may begin to wane, as evidenced by the first – since 2008 Q2 – acceleration in unit labour cost growth in the economy in 2010 Q2.",
        "Moreover – according to those Council members – raising the minimum wage in 2011 might be a factor increasing the wage pressure.",
        "While discussing inflation developments, it was stressed that both the annual CPI and core inflation remained at low levels, even though a rise in the CPI close to the target could be expected as early as in September 2010.",
        "It was pointed out that inflation would be raised by strong increases in the prices of agricultural commodities in the world observed in recent months.",
        "At the same time, however, some Council members argued that the growth of food prices in Poland was lower than previously anticipated, considering both domestic (negative impact of floods on crops) and external factors (high growth of world food prices).",
        "On this occasion, some Council members claimed that, due to the size of the domestic agricultural market, also in the future the transmission of price increases in the world markets on the prices in Poland may be limited.",
        "Other Council members pointed out that, due to the links between agricultural markets at an international level, the growth of domestic food prices might be expected to accelerate in the coming period, bringing about higher inflation than it had been previously assessed.",
        "Some members also indicated a strong increase in the annual growth of producer prices in industry, which may signal an acceleration of cost pressure.",
        "While analysing changes in inflation expectations, it was pointed out that in the case of households the expectations had fallen in September, yet some Council members emphasized that they continued to run above the current inflation.",
        "It was also stressed that the forecasts of financial sector analysts had stabilized above the NBP inflation target.",
        "At the same time, some Council members pointed out that the stabilisation of inflation forecasts of bank analysts was accompanied by rise in their expectations of NBP interest rate hikes.",
        "In this context, those Council members argued that the lack of monetary policy tightening might pose a risk of an upward revision of these forecasts.",
        "In their opinion, another factor that could be conducive to raising analysts’ forecasts and inflation expectations (especially those of enterprises) was the continuing recovery in economic activity and the associated rise of cost pressure as well as diminishing of demand barriers.",
        "While discussing the situation in the public finance sector, some Council members pointed out that some of the measures announced in the budget draft for 2011 were one-off, which meant that they would not contribute to any permanent deceleration in the rate of public debt accrual.",
        "Other members emphasised that although the fiscal imbalance in Poland was large, it did not differ significantly from the average in EU countries.",
        "According to those Council members, the relatively favourable assessment of Poland’s economic situation and the reduction of new issues of Treasury securities by some countries characterised with currently largest fiscal imbalance might be helpful in sustaining high demand for Polish Treasury securities.",
        "This should facilitate the financing of the public finance deficit, unless investor sentiment deteriorated strongly and capital flows in global financial markets reversed.",
        "While addressing the impact of fiscal policy on inflation, some Council members argued that the announced wage freeze in the public sector, the abolition of certain tax reliefs and exemptions, and rises in VAT rates, once effective, would reduce the demand pressure in 2011 to some extent.",
        "While analysing the developments of monetary and credit aggregates, some Council members pointed out that M3 growth was still moderate, similarly to the growth of lending to the private sector, which resulted, on the one hand, from stable growth in lending to households and, on the other hand, from the lack of revival in lending to the corporate sector.",
        "Other Council members stressed that August 2010 brought further acceleration of M3 growth, and the growth of housing loans was significantly faster than the growth of disposable income of households.",
        "Some members of the Council pointed out that despite NBP interest rates being maintained unchanged the interest charged on loans to households decreased.",
        "Moreover, some Council members argued that since May 2010 the value of loans to enterprises (after adjusting for exchange rate fluctuations) had been gradually increasing, and that the slow growth of these loans resulted primarily from enterprises’ limited demand for credit.",
        "A limited growth in corporate demand for credit is indicated by NBP survey results, where the percentage of enterprises applying for loans remains low, with a clear increase in the share of loan applications approved by banks.",
        "While referring to the zloty exchange rate, some Council members argued that the recently observed appreciation of the zloty would be conducive to curbing inflation.",
        "The Council also discussed factors that could affect the zloty exchange rate in the future, including the equilibrium exchange rate, the role of interest rate disparity, the risk of changes in investor attitude to emerging economies and surplus liquidity in global financial markets.",
        "In particular, some Council members pointed out that under expansionary monetary policy continuously pursued by central banks in major developed economies a possible NBP interest rate hike could be conducive to an excessively rapid zloty appreciation.",
        "Other Council members, however, argued that the impact of the interest rate disparity on the zloty exchange rate might be offset by other factors affecting the exchange rate, including the situation of the public finance sector in Poland and abroad, and high uncertainty persisting in global financial markets.",
        "While considering the decision on interest rates, some members of the Council argued that GDP growth in 2010 Q2 and the possibility of its acceleration in subsequent quarters under the likely reduced potential output growth, combined with further improvement in the labour market situation, could – in the absence of an NBP interest rate hike – contribute to a rise in inflationary pressure in the monetary policy transmission horizon.",
        "Similarly to the Council meeting held in August, those members also emphasised that the current level of interest rates was adequate for the situation of turmoil in global financial markets and the ensuing severe slowdown observed in the Polish economy.",
        "In the opinion of those Council members, a hike in interest rates, despite the expansionary monetary policy pursued by major central banks in the world, would mean adjusting the rates to the change of the conditions.",
        "According to those Council members, such an adjustment of interest rates would also limit the risk of a rise in inflation expectations.",
        "Other members of the Council argued that the moderate rate of economic growth and the accompanying limited wage and inflationary pressures, along with the risk of weakening global economic growth in the subsequent quarters, justified keeping the NBP interest rates unchanged.",
        "Moreover – they argued – an NBP interest rate hike, amidst major central banks maintaining the expansionary monetary policy, could increase the risk of an overly rapid zloty exchange rate appreciation.",
        "A motion to raise the NBP interest rates by 50 basis points was put forward at the meeting.",
        "The motion did not pass.",
        "The Council kept the interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 3.50%, the lombard rate at 5.00%, the deposit rate at 2.00%, the rediscount rate at 3.75% and the discount rate at 4.00%.",
        "at the link between economic growth in Western Europe and the growth of Polish exports to that region.",
        "They emphasized that it was necessary to accept the new reality, namely that in the years to come growth in the Western European countries would reach approx.",
        "1-1.5% annually, which, however, should not prevent Polish exports from growing by 610% per year.",
        "At the same time they pointed out that in the period from 2004 till the outbreak of the crisis Polish exports had grown 14-23% yearly despite the fact that GDP of the Western European countries grew by a mere 2-2.5% per year.",
        "Some members of the Council emphasized that intensified financial-market turmoil driven by fiscal imbalances in some Western European countries and potential problems faced by financial institutions from European countries could be a more significant threat to domestic economic growth than the absence of clear signs of economic recovery in the euro area.",
        "Yet members of the Council pointed out that the hitherto observed zloty exchange rate depreciation might support GDP growth in Poland.",
        "Some members of the Council also pointed to the possibility of faster than currently anticipated revival in domestic demand, which might be supported by the good financial condition of enterprises.",
        "While discussing the investment activity of enterprises it was pointed out that corporate investment was being curtailed due to low production capacity utilization, relatively low demand growth and high uncertainty about the outlook for global economic growth as well as about changes in public finances.",
        "In the opinion of some members of the Council, corporate investment might thus remain low in the coming years.",
        "Other members of the Council assessed, however, that an increase in corporate investment in response to revived demand might be equally as fast as its decline during the crisis.",
        "In the opinion of those members of the Council a fast revival of corporate investment might be supported by enterprises’ very good financial condition, including the liquidity condition.",
        "Some members of the Council assessed that limited bank lending would have a negative impact on investment, especially that of SMEs whose financial condition was not as good as the situation of large enterprises.",
        "Other members of the Council argued, however, that almost of enterprises in Poland did not use bank loans to finance their investment; therefore, the banks’ lending policy will not significantly limit their investment activity.",
        "Moreover, some members of the Council indicated that the currently low growth in corporate lending was a result of low demand for credit, which was connected with low investment activity and was characteristic of an early stage of economic recovery.",
        "While analysing the results of the June GDP projection based on the NECMOD model some members of the Council assessed that the strong acceleration of public investment and absorption of EU funds in the period preceding the 2012 UEFA European Football Championship anticipated in the projection was very unlikely.",
        "For this reason and due to slower economic growth abroad, in the opinion of those members of the Council the year 2011 might be expected to bring lower investment and GDP growth than assumed in the projection.",
        "While analysing the inflationary processes in Poland, some members of the Council judged that the current stage of economic recovery had a non-inflationary character.",
        "They pointed out that the negative output gap and slow growth of unit labour costs in the economy would contribute to keeping inflation low.",
        "At the same time, some members of the Council assessed that the hitherto observed zloty exchange rate depreciation would be conducive to a rise in inflation.",
        "Other members of the Council emphasized, however, that the impact of the zloty exchange rate depreciation on inflation in Poland might be limited by a large share of intra-corporate trade in imports.",
        "While discussing the outlook for inflation developments in Poland, some members of the Council assessed that due to the persisting low level of production capacity utilization and a high unemployment rate, an acceleration of economic growth did not threaten the stabilization of inflation at the level of the NBP inflation target.",
        "Other members of the Council argued, however, that even a moderate acceleration of GDP growth might lead to a rise in demand pressure, since – as a result of the global financial crisis – potential output growth in Poland might have declined.",
        "Those members stressed that both the June projection based on the NECMOD model and other forecasts prepared at the NBP pointed at a rise in inflation above the inflation target over the monetary policy horizon.",
        "They pointed out that in accordance with the results of the June projection the probability of inflation running above the inflation target over the monetary policy horizon was twice as high as the probability of inflation running below the inflation target.",
        "They argued that CPI inflation might run at a level higher than that suggested by the central projection path.",
        "This may be driven by both faster growth in food and energy prices and an earlier intensification of the wage pressure in the Polish economy than those assumed in the projection.",
        "They expressed an opinion that the possibility of growth in food and energy prices over the next twelve months being faster than assumed in the projection was suggested by short-term forecasts prepared at the NBP.",
        "Moreover, in the opinion of those members of the Council, the world prices of energy commodities, and, in consequence, energy prices in Poland, might grow faster than expected in the projection also over a longer horizon.",
        "While addressing the June projection’s results concerning wages in the economy, some members of the Council pointed out that the relatively low wage growth in the subsequent quarters resulted from the assumption of incomplete adjustment of employment to the fall in demand during the economic slowdown (the so-called “labour hoarding”).",
        "At the same time, they indicated that this “labour hoarding” might be attributed to growing specialization of enterprises which results in higher costs connected with staff rotation and to a decline in the pool of qualified labour force caused by emigration.",
        "According to those members of the Council, given such sources of this phenomenon it might be a factor intensifying the wage pressure, unlike in the previous economic recovery period.",
        "Those members emphasized that in the quarters to come a higher growth in wages in the economy than that anticipated in the projection might be suggested by: accelerating growth in wages in the corporate sector at the beginning of 2010 Q2, high wage growth in the public sector in 2010 Q1 and a relatively large number of job offers per one unemployed person.",
        "In the opinion of those members of the Council, faster growth of wages might also be driven by a good financial condition of firms, including public sector enterprises, which might reduce their resistance to wage demands of employees.",
        "A similar impact may be exerted on the one hand, by regulatory changes increasing the flexibility of wage determination in the public sector, and, on the other hand, by the increase in the minimum wage scheduled for the end of 2010.",
        "Those members of the Council assessed that the recently observed high wage growth in the mining industry might boost wage demands in other public sector enterprises.",
        "Other members of the Council pointed out, however, that the persisting relatively high unemployment would be a factor limiting wage growth in the economy.",
        "Some members of the Council argued that also the number of persons employed in the economy might be higher than that assumed in the projection.",
        "This is suggested by gradually growing employment in the enterprise sector whose changes in the past were indicative of changes in employment in the whole economy.",
        "Both a faster wage growth than that anticipated in the projection as well as a higher growth in the number of the employed would mean a stronger inflationary pressure stemming from the labour market and would increase the growth in consumption demand.",
        "While discussing the fiscal imbalance in the Western European countries, members of the Council paid attention to the high uncertainty surrounding the implementation of measures aimed to reduce it.",
        "It was emphasised that a fiscal consolidation in some of the euro area countries was necessary as its absence could increase turmoil in the financial markets.",
        "Some members of the Council assessed that the fiscal consolidation might have a negative impact on economic growth in Poland’s trading partners, and, as a result, on Polish exports.",
        "Some members of the Council indicated that the fiscal policy tightening might result in private demand revival and faster economic growth in European countries (i.e.",
        "the so-called non-Keynesian effects of fiscal tightening might occur).",
        "On the other hand, countries which fail to implement a consolidation of public finances or which continue to pursue expansionary fiscal policy, might see a decline in economic growth caused by the fiscal imbalance’s negative impact on private demand.",
        "Those members pointed out that the impact of the fiscal consolidation on economic growth would depend largely on the structure of the fiscal adjustment (including, in particular, on whether the deficit would be reduced mainly through tax increases or expenditure cuts, and on which expenditures would be reduced).",
        "They also emphasised that the emergence of expansionary effects of a fiscal tightening was dependent upon the credibility of the fiscal policy measures.",
        "At the same time, other members of the Council assessed that the scale of the planned fiscal tightening in the Western European countries was not large.",
        "Therefore, in the opinion of those members of the Council the impact of the fiscal consolidation on economic growth would be small.",
        "They emphasized that amidst low interest rates the occurrence of strong non-Keynesian effects of the fiscal tightening was very unlikely.",
        "The Council paid significant attention to the public finance situation in Poland.",
        "It was pointed out that high liquidity in the international financial markets at the moment facilitated the financing of the state budget deficit, and the public finance situation in Poland was hitherto more favourable than that observed in many European countries.",
        "Some members of the Council indicated that together with the progressing economic recovery in Poland the general government deficit to GDP ratio, an important indicator used by investors to assess a country's credit risk, would improve as well.",
        "Yet, the majority of Council members emphasized that economic recovery alone would not be sufficient to reduce the deficit of the general government sector in Poland to a low level, and that it was necessary to undertake measures aimed at rationalizing public expenditure.",
        "It was pointed out that if the other European economies consolidated their public finances and Poland ran a persistently high general government deficit, the costs of its financing might increase.",
        "At the same time, some members of the Council assessed that a considerable reduction in the public finance imbalance in Poland was rather unlikely in the coming months.",
        "Those members pointed out that no drafts of legal acts had hitherto been presented which would allow for a considerable reduction of the state budget deficit in the next few years.",
        "Some members of the Council indicated that due to some expenditures being transferred outside the state budget, current data on state budget implementation did not allow for an assessment of the situation in the general government sector as a whole.",
        "It was emphasised that should the general government deficit remain high it might be necessary to pursue a more restrictive monetary policy.",
        "While analysing the monetary policy abroad and in Poland, it was pointed out that given the absence of clear signs of economic recovery in the euro area, interest rates in this region might be expected to run at a low level for a longer period of time.",
        "In the opinion of some members of the Council this was one of the factors to be taken into account while deciding about the monetary policy parameters in Poland.",
        "Other members of the Council argued, however, that due to the differences in business cycles in Poland and in the euro area, observed over the past few years, the adjustment of monetary policy parameters in Poland might be needed earlier than in the euro area.",
        "While discussing the impact of the interest rate disparity on the exchange rate, some members of the Council indicated that at the moment this disparity did not have any significant impact on exchange rate developments, as suggested by similar exchange rate developments observed in emerging economies regardless of whether they had already embarked on a monetary policy tightening or not.",
        "Those members emphasized that should many countries continue to observe tensions in the public finance sector, the exchange rate’s sensitivity to interest rate changes might remain limited.",
        "While discussing developments in the Polish zloty exchange rate some members of the Council pointed out that due to the real convergence process the real zloty exchange rate should appreciate in the long run.",
        "At the same time those members of the Council indicated that in the past few years the exchange rate of the zloty had been highly volatile.",
        "It was pointed out that currently changes in international financial market sentiment had a considerable impact on zloty exchange rate.",
        "In the opinion of those members of the Council, given the likelihood of risk aversion remaining high in the financial markets, the exchange rate of the zloty will not be a factor curbing inflation in the Polish economy.",
        "Yet, some members of the Council assessed that the currently observed zloty depreciation might be temporary.",
        "While discussing the current level of interest rates in Poland, it was assessed that the uncertainty concerning the situation in the external environment and its impact on the Polish economy, including the zloty exchange rate developments, justified keeping the NBP interest rates unchanged.",
        "At the same time, some members of the Council indicated that interest rates in Poland were running at a level lower than the natural rate for the Polish economy.",
        "According to those Council members further economic recovery and a growing risk of inflation running above the NBP inflation target might speak in favour of raising the interest rates.",
        "Yet, other members of the Council assessed that the absence of clear signs of economic recovery in the euro area, limited investment activity of enterprises and no signs of revival in bank lending to firms might justify the continuation of the existing monetary policy.",
        "The Council kept the interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 3.50%, the lombard rate at 5.00%, the deposit rate at 2.00%, the rediscount rate at 3.75% and the discount rate at 4.00%.",
        "During its meeting the Monetary Policy Council discussed the economic growth and inflation in Poland, situation in the labour market and in the public finance sector, both in Poland and abroad, and the outlook for GDP growth in the external environment of the Polish economy.",
        "While discussing the outlook for economic growth in Poland, some members of the Council assessed that the recently released data were indicative of a stabilising rate of economic growth.",
        "They pointed out that domestic economic activity might be limited by potentially weakening growth in the external environment of the Polish economy.",
        "At the same time, these members pointed to the persistently weak investment demand of the private sector.",
        "It was emphasised that most enterprises do not intend to carry on investments increasing their production capacity given their expectations of economic growth stabilising at the current level.",
        "Moreover, some Council members pointed out that the announced change in VAT rates would be mitigating household consumption growth in 2011.",
        "Those members also emphasised that demand in the Polish economy would be curbed by the tightening of banks’ lending policy with respect to households’ loans resulting from Recommendation T entering into force.",
        "However, forecasts indicating the possibility of a marked GDP acceleration in Poland were also invoked.",
        "It was pointed out that GDP growth in the coming quarters would be driven by inventories being rebuilt by enterprises.",
        "In turn, growing employment will be conducive to private consumption rising faster than so far observed.",
        "In the opinion of some members of the Council further recovery in economic activity will also be supported by growing exports.",
        "Those members argued that given the current exchange rate of the zloty, high export growth would be a driving force behind improvement in the financial condition of exporters, and, consequently, behind an increase of employment and wages by those entities.",
        "Growing aggregate wages in the sector of exporters will be, in turn, conducive to growing consumption which may lead to a rapid revival of investment in the private sector given the level of capacity utilization currently exceeding the long-term average.",
        "While discussing the situation in the labour market, it was pointed out that growing employment in the enterprise sector was accompanied by low wage growth.",
        "It was emphasized that such improvement in the labour market situation was favourable from the point of view of inflationary developments as it curbed the risk of a simultaneous increase in demand and cost pressure.",
        "Some members of the Council pointed out that neither data concerning planned changes in wages in enterprises nor wage expectations were indicative of the risk of considerable acceleration in wage growth.",
        "Other members of the Council emphasized, however, that some information from the labour market pointed to the wage pressure possibly rising in the subsequent quarters.",
        "The accelerating wage growth in enterprises in 2010 Q2 and the possibility of a rise in public sector wage growth in 2010 Q3 as a result of increases in teacher wages were highlighted.",
        "Those members also drew attention to improving forecasts of employment in enterprises, in particular, in microenterprises, the most likely to yield to wage pressure.",
        "At the same time, some members of the Council argued that with the economic growth strengthening further in Poland the risk of rising wage pressure is increased by a  Warszawa ul Świętokrzy ska  (22)  51 relatively high and still growing level of wage expectations of the unemployed, adversely affecting their readiness to take up employment.",
        "Some members of the Council also indicated that lifting of restrictions on the access to the labour market in Germany and Austria for citizens of EU member states from Central and Eastern Europe in 2011 might lead to a drop in the number of the economically active in the Polish economy, and, in consequence, contribute to increase in wage pressure.",
        "While analysing the inflationary processes in Poland, some members of the Council pointed out that, as anticipated, CPI inflation was running at a relatively low level.",
        "Those members also pointed at a continuing decline in all core inflation measures.",
        "At the same time, they emphasised that despite previously expressed concerns about the developments in domestic food prices, in the past few months changes in those prices were acting towards inflation decline.",
        "Yet, other members of the Council indicated that CPI inflation was currently higher than indicated by some of the forecasts made at the beginning of 2010.",
        "Referring to inflation developments, some members of the Council pointed out that according to the available forecasts, inflation was running close to the NBP inflation target in the monetary policy horizon.",
        "They assessed that inflation would be curbed by moderate economic growth.",
        "In their opinion, low growth of unit labour costs in the economy, including their continuing decline in industry, is also a factor limiting the rise in inflation.",
        "Other members of the Council emphasised, however, that in the past the growth rate of unit labour costs in industry had not been a good leading indicator of inflationary pressure in the economy.",
        "Since inflation fell to a low level, this growth rate was positive only at the peak of the boom and during the economic slowdown.",
        "They assessed also that amidst likely acceleration of economic growth, increasing demand pressure would contribute to a rise in inflation.",
        "At the same time, they pointed out that in the case of a considerable slump in economic growth, zloty exchange rate depreciation resulting from a possible worsening of the public finance situation could constitute a risk for price stability.",
        "Some members of the Council emphasized that a marked increase in the growth of producer prices might be indicative of the risk of inflation acceleration.",
        "They also pointed out at rising cereal prices in the global markets.",
        "Some members of the Council argued that despite unfavourable demand situation in some countries, the global cereal supply should not be significantly reduced, which – given high stocks of these commodities – should limit the rise of their prices.",
        "Yet, other members of the Council pointed out that given still significant liquidity surplus in the global financial markets there was a risk of considerable rise in food prices.",
        "Referring to the change in VAT rates scheduled for the beginning of 2011, members of the Council pointed out that the increase in the price level driven by this change should be rather insignificant, and given stable inflation expectations, its impact on CPI inflation might be expected to be only temporary.",
        "Some members of the Council emphasized, however, that changes in VAT rates might boost inflation expectations.",
        "In the opinion of those members of the Council, the risk of rising inflation expectations was also increased by growing prices of some food commodities in the world markets and the possibility of a rise in administered prices resulting from the need to reduce high public finance deficit.",
        "At the same time, some members of the Council assessed that inflation expectations were currently running at an increased level.",
        "While discussing the situation in the public finance sector in Poland, some members of the Council pointed out that despite relatively favourable data concerning realization of the state budget and revenues from social insurance contributions, there was a risk of a significantly higher deficit in the public finance sector in 2010 than previously anticipated.",
        "In the opinion of those members of the Council, budgetary situation of local governments might be a factor contributing to an increase in public finance deficit.",
        "Yet, some members of the Council drew attention to the uncertainty about the growth of local governments’ debt in 2010 and assessed that a potential rise in the public finance deficit in relation to GPD did not have to be significant.",
        "While analysing medium-term risks for economic growth and inflation, the Council also discussed the Long-term Financial Plan for the State.",
        "It was emphasized that consolidation measures presented in this Plan were not sufficient to significantly limit the public finance deficit and halt the fast growth of public debt.",
        "Some members of the Council also pointed out that there was a risk of higher level of expenditure, as compared to the level anticipated in the Plan, being adopted in the Budget Act for 2011.",
        "At the same time, some members of the Council claimed that continuation of loose fiscal policy would increase the risk of growing inflationary pressure in the Polish economy, in particular, in the case of reversal of capital flows in the global financial markets.",
        "Yet, other members of the Council argued that fiscal policy should not boost inflationary pressure given the planned tightening of the fiscal policy in 2011, although the scale of this tightening would not be considerable.",
        "It was emphasised that a more comprehensive assessment of the implications of fiscal environment for the monetary policy would be possible after getting acquainted with the draft state budget for 2011.",
        "While discussing the external environment of the Polish economy, members of the Council pointed at a decline of GDP growth in 2010 Q2 in the United States and China and acceleration of GDP growth in the euro area, driven mainly by a strong rise in economic activity in Germany.",
        "In the opinion of some members of the Council, incoming information suggests that recovery in the American economy begins to falter which is likely to have a negative impact on the global economic outlook.",
        "Other members of the Council assessed that decline in GDP growth in the United States was in line with the expectations of lower potential output growth in major developed economies after the financial crisis.",
        "On the basis of the above and based on the past recession experience they insisted that the likelihood of double dip in the global economy was minor.",
        "Referring to the fiscal situation abroad, some members of the Council argued that, although the tensions in financial markets related to high imbalance of public finance in some euro area member states had subsided, the problem of excessive debt remained unsolved.",
        "Those members emphasized that it was at present impossible to rule out another wave of tensions related to high indebtedness which would adversely affect the global economic outlook.",
        "At the same time, some members of the Council pointed out that persisting high imbalance of public finance in major developed economies might have a negative effect on their potential growth.",
        "During the meeting the uncertainty about the current potential output growth in Poland was also addressed.",
        "Some members of the Council assessed that potential output growth declined as a result of the global financial crisis and also due to other factors, not related with the crisis.",
        "Other members of the Council maintained that moderate rise in unemployment in Poland during the economic slowdown and still growing number of economically active persons reduced the likelihood of decline in potential output growth.",
        "During the discussion about interest rates in Poland and abroad, some Council members pointed to the continuation of expansionary monetary policy by major central banks in developed countries.",
        "According to those members, under such circumstances, increase in interest rate disparity relating to a potential rise in the NBP interest rates could contribute to increased capital inflow to the Polish economy and to an excessively rapid zloty appreciation.",
        "Other Council members argued, however, that the impact of the increased interest rate disparity on the zloty exchange rate might be limited.",
        "In this context, those members indicated that a few central banks in developed and developing countries had recently increased interest rates.",
        "According to those members of the Council, the impact of the increased interest rate disparity on the zloty exchange rate might also be limited by other factors affecting the exchange rate, including the situation in the public finance sector.",
        "It was further indicated that amidst strong inflow of portfolio capital connected with high borrowing needs of the government, changes in investor attitudes to emerging economies could constitute a major risk for the zloty exchange rate developments.",
        "Monetary aggregate developments were also discussed at the meeting.",
        "Some members of the Council emphasised that the growth of M3 remains low.",
        "In particular, some of those members pointed out that there was no revival in lending and the growth of loans to enterprises stabilised at a low level.",
        "Other members of the Council indicated that the growth of M3 had increased in past few months and was higher than during the recovery from the previous economic slump.",
        "They also drew attention to the rise in demand for most loan types, as signalled by banks.",
        "While considering the decision on interest rates, some Council members argued that the present GDP growth, with a possibility of its acceleration and a likely reduced potential output growth, could contribute to a rise in inflationary pressure in the monetary policy transmission horizon.",
        "Those members emphasized that the current level of interest rates was adequate for a situation of strong slowdown in the growth of the Polish economy and the recession in its environment, and that given recovery gaining strength in Poland it was justified to increase the NBP interest rates.",
        "Moreover, according to those members of the Council, the increase in interest rates would contain the risk of a rise in inflation expectations and favour the growth in savings rate in the economy, and would, in consequence, contribute to maintaining sustainable economic growth in a longer period.",
        "In addition some Council members argued that in order to tighten monetary policy an increase in the required reserve rate might be justified.",
        "Other Council members pointed to the continuing adverse growth outlook in the external environment of the Polish economy and the lack of clear signals of further acceleration in the domestic economic growth.",
        "Those members emphasized that the currently low inflationary pressure and weakening of factors contributing to a rise in inflationary pressure in the recent period justified keeping the NBP interest rates unchanged.",
        "They also indicated that a rise in interest rates could increase the risk of a too quick zloty exchange rate appreciation.",
        "Some Council members argued that an increase of interest rates could weaken the recovery of economic growth in Poland too much.",
        "A motion to raise the required reserve rate by 50 basis points was put forward.",
        "The motion did not pass.",
        "A motion to raise NBP interest rates by 50 basis points was also put forward.",
        "The motion did not pass.",
        "The Council kept the interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 3.50%, the lombard rate at 5.00%, the deposit rate at 2.00%, the rediscount rate at 3.75% and the discount rate at 4.00%.",
        "During its meeting the Monetary Policy Council discussed primarily the situation in the external environment of the Polish economy, zloty exchange rate developments and the outlook for economic growth and inflation in Poland.",
        "While addressing the developments abroad, strengthening recovery in the United States was emphasized, in particular an improvement in the labour market and restoring consumer demand.",
        "Some Council members assessed that the recovery in the US economy may persist even after withdrawal of fiscal stimuli, although the scale of improvement in economic activity may be curbed by still limited access to loans and the appreciation of the US dollar against the euro.",
        "At the same time a gradual increase in euro area economic activity and improving economic conditions in Central and Eastern Europe, a region with a substantial share in Polish exports, were pointed at.",
        "In particular, attention was drawn to positive data from the German economy.",
        "Some Council members emphasized positive impact of a rapid economic growth in China on short-term prospects of German exports, and consequently, on the exports of Central and Eastern European countries.",
        "At the same time those members pointed out that the growing macroeconomic imbalances in China, reflected in the rising inflation in the country, generated a risk to global economic growth in the longer term.",
        "During the discussion on the economic outlook for the euro area, the risks associated with the fiscal problems of many countries of the region were highlighted.",
        "Some Council members argued that in order to contain growing public debt in these countries, substantial fiscal consolidation must be conducted.",
        "If combined with the rise in market interest rates and more difficult access to loans it could have a dampening impact on economic growth in the euro area in the short- and mediumterm.",
        "Some Council members pointed, however, to uncertainty regarding the possibility of carrying out significant fiscal adjustments in some euro area countries.",
        "At the same time other members of the Council deemed the possibility of limiting spending of households and enterprises as a result of the increased uncertainty associated with the fiscal imbalances and curbing of public spending in some euro area countries to be a downside risk to a medium-term economic growth of this region.",
        "They argued that this constitutes more important downside risk to the euro area economic growth than the increase in the long-term interest rates.",
        "On the other hand, some Council members indicated that the recently observed euro depreciation, increasing the price competitiveness of euro area exports could favourably affect the economic growth in this region.",
        "Other Council members argued, however, that the euro exchange rate fluctuations had a moderate impact on the competitiveness of euro area exports due to the structure of exports of major euro area economies.",
        "While analysing global price developments, the rise in inflation in the major emerging economies was emphasized.",
        "At the same time, some Council members indicated that inflationary pressures remained low in the major developed economies, where core inflation fell in April 2010 to historically low levels.",
        "They made a point that a drop in oil prices in the world markets in May 2010 could contribute to a decline in headline inflation in the world.",
        "Other Council members, however,  Warszawa ul Świętokrzy ska  (22)  51 assessed that the recent fall in oil prices had been associated with the appreciation of the US dollar, and therefore its disinflationary impact would be limited.",
        "Furthermore, they also pointed out that a strong growth in euro-denominated commodity prices observed until April 2010 may be conducive towards an increase in inflation in the euro area.",
        "While analysing the situation in the Polish economy, it was highlighted that the persistent upward trend in industrial output, further increase of economic indicators, and improving situation on the labour market confirmed the continued recovery.",
        "Some Council members indicated that the low level of investment in the corporate sector may limit future economic growth in Poland.",
        "Other Council members argued that the low level of investment was typical of the current phase of the business cycle.",
        "While discussing the impact of the national mourning and the flood on the Polish economy, some Council members believed that those events would have a minor impact on the economic growth in Poland.",
        "Other Council members assessed that the national mourning could significantly affect consumer demand, and therefore April 2010 was likely to bring lower growth of retail sales.",
        "Moreover, some Council members pointed out that the flood had not yet come to an end, so there was considerable uncertainty regarding the scale of its impact on the economy.",
        "They made a point that the increase in investment (including public investment) as a result of the necessary removal of flood-related damage may be conducive to higher growth in subsequent quarters.",
        "At the same time, some Council members referred to uncertainty about the impact of flood on the inflationary developments in Poland, noting that the flood can contribute towards the growth in some prices, including those of unprocessed food and insurance.",
        "In the discussion on inflationary developments, some Council members assessed that inflationary pressures in the Polish economy remain moderate at the current juncture.",
        "More specifically, those members highlighted a clear decline in core inflation rates observed in recent months, which besides statistical effects - largely reflected an earlier appreciation of the zloty exchange rate and easing of cost and demand pressures.",
        "In their view, these factors should be determining inflation also in the coming months.",
        "Moreover, as those Council members claimed, continued relatively low growth in unit labour costs – characteristic of the current phase of the business cycle - and stable inflation expectations of economic agents should favour inflation running at the level which would pose no risk to meeting the inflation target over a one-year horizon.",
        "In addition, some Council members indicated that subdued lending and low capacity utilization in the economy would also have a dampening impact on the inflation in Poland.",
        "It was emphasized that most available forecasts implied the persistence of low inflation in coming months.",
        "Other Council members stressed, however, that April 2010 was a consecutive month of a marked hike in inflation on a monthly basis, and also noted that the level of consumer prices rose by 1.6% in the first four months 2010 as a result of those increases.",
        "They emphasized that the balance of risks for short-term NBP inflation forecasts was asymmetrical and pointed to a greater risk of higher inflation than would follow up from the central path.",
        "Those members also drew attention to the hikes observed in recent months in prices of certain goods imported from countries with low production costs and to the stabilisation of China's share of Polish imports.",
        "According to those Council members it may indicate that while recovering from the current economic slowdown, inflation would not be reduced by the increasing share of these goods in consumption, as was the case during the previous downturn.",
        "Moreover, some Council members pointed out that the recent weakening of the zloty exchange rate, increases in administered prices and strengthening economic recovery should contribute towards higher inflation in Poland.",
        "While discussing the zloty exchange rate and its impact on inflation, the Council considered that the current exchange rate of the zloty was marked by high volatility.",
        "In view of the Council, changes in investors' sentiment in global financial markets, largely determined by changing perception of fiscal risk in Greece and some other euro area economies, significantly influenced short-term zloty exchange rate fluctuations.",
        "Some Council members pointed out that in line with the convergence of the Polish economy, the appreciation of the zloty exchange rate may be expected in the longer term, and that the current disturbances were not of a permanent character.",
        "Uncertainty on financial markets may, however, impact zloty exchange rate developments in the short term.",
        "In the discussion on the labour market situation, a gradual increase in employment in the corporate sector and a decline in the seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate in April 2010 were pointed at.",
        "Some Council members took note that employment growth in the corporate sector had not been so far accompanied by a significant increase in wage pressure.",
        "Other Council members, however, emphasized that the growth rate of social security and health contributions indicated that the increase in wages in the economy may be stronger than in the corporate sector, whereas a rapid growth in disposable income in Q4 2009 may reflect a fast growth in income from other sources than labour.",
        "Moreover, those members assessed that the growing ability of enterprises to finance spending may make them more willing to increase wages or employment.",
        "At the same time, those members pointed out that April 2010 was the second consecutive month of increase in the annual real wages in the corporate sector.",
        "While analysing credit market developments, it was pointed at further decline in the value of corporate loans, in particular in investment loans, and low growth of loans to households.",
        "Some Council members argued that low level of lending to the corporate sector was typical of the current phase of the business cycle.",
        "They emphasized that the demand for credit may also be limited by favourable liquidity conditions of enterprises, as evidenced by the liquidity ratios which rose in Q1 2010 to their historical heights and by a robust growth in corporate deposits.",
        "Other Council members pointed out, however, that the data on the liquidity of enterprises covered relatively large companies, whereas limited access to loans adversely affects the development prospects of small and medium-sized enterprises, which have higher demand for external financing in the form of bank loans.",
        "Referring to the prospects of lending, some Council members pointed out that thanks to their strong capital position banks could increase the supply of loans.",
        "According to those members of the Council, at the time being the turmoil in international financial markets limits the increase in the supply of housing loans denominated in foreign currencies by creating obstacles to their refinancing.",
        "If the turmoil recedes, this segment of the credit market may show a rapid expansion.",
        "While addressing the fiscal policy, some Council members assessed that fiscal policy tightening in the short term would result in a slower economic growth in Poland.",
        "However further fiscal consolidation is required to reduce the general government deficit.",
        "Moreover, those members assessed that postponing Poland's accession to the euro area would reduce incentives for early fiscal reforms.",
        "While referring to Poland’s compliance with the price stability criterion of the Maastricht Treaty, some Council members pointed out that countries with negative twelve-month average HICP inflation rates had been included to determine the reference value for the price stability criterion in the May 2010 Convergence Reports of the European Commission and European Central Bank, which resulted in a very low level of the reference value.",
        "According to these members, regarding the countries with negative twelve-month average HICP inflation rates as the best-performing countries in terms of price stability may complicate the prospective fulfilment of this criterion by Poland.",
        "While analysing monetary policy abroad and at home, some Council members indicated that the central banks from Central and Eastern Europe had further eased their monetary policies and, according to market expectations, the ECB should raise interest rates at the earliest in the following year.",
        "Other Council members argued, however, that the parameters of monetary policy in Poland may change earlier than in the developed economies.",
        "Some Council members assessed at the same time that the increase in ex post real interest rate (CPI-deflated) in April 2010 was indicative of a more restrictive monetary policy.",
        "The Council assessed that the uncertainty concerning the impact of the situation in the external environment on the outlook for economic growth in Poland and on the zloty exchange rate justified keeping the NBP interest rates unchanged at the current meeting.",
        "Moreover, some Council members argued that a more comprehensive assessment of the outlook for inflation and economic growth in Poland will be possible after considering the June inflation and GDP projection.",
        "The Council kept the interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 3.50%, the lombard rate at 5.00%, the deposit rate at 2.00%, the rediscount rate at 3.75% and the discount rate at 4.00%.",
        "During its meeting the Monetary Policy Council discussed primarily the outlook for economic growth and inflation in the world and in Poland, zloty exchange rate developments, the situation of the public finance sector and the future monetary policy.",
        "While discussing the situation in the external environment of the Polish economy, a further rise in economic activity in the United States, particularly noticeable in industry, was emphasised.",
        "It was assessed that the stabilisation in the unemployment rate combined with an employment decline slower than in the previous period may signal a gradual deceleration of unfavourable tendencies in the labour market.",
        "At the same time, it was stressed that February brought a deterioration in US consumer sentiment, which could have been connected with the still high unemployment level and a worsening situation in the real estate market.",
        "Some members of the Council argued that a limited scale of lending to the private sector and the bad situation in the real estate market, on the one hand, and the persistently high budget deficit, on the other, constitute risk factors to a permanent recovery of economic growth in the United States.",
        "While analysing the situation in the euro area, it was pointed out that the economic climate there was improving at a markedly slower pace than in the United States, although – similarly to the US economy – the decelerating decline in employment and the stabilisation of the unemployment rate might be signalling that negative tendencies in the labour market were slowing down gradually.",
        "It was also argued that in the coming period economic activity in the euro area would be supported by a growing demand from developing economies, particularly Asian ones.",
        "Some Council members, however, pointed out that the outlook for euro-area exports may be negatively affected by their geographical structure and a weakening competitiveness of the German economy, connected with the recent rise in unit labour cost in this economy.",
        "It was also assessed that the latest monthly data, including a drop in retail sales and a deterioration of some economic climate indicators in January might point to a continuation of weak internal demand in the euro area.",
        "In the view of some Council members, the data on GDP for 2009 Q4 and the latest monthly data may indicate that the improvement of activity in this economy was only transitory and, to a large extent, resulted from government stimulus programmes.",
        "In this context it was pointed out that the sustainability of the global economic recovery remained subject to uncertainty.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members this uncertainty is connected primarily with tensions in the financial markets caused by financial problems of some euro-area countries, notably Greece, and with macroeconomic policy in the largest European economies and in the United States being gradually less and less expansionary.",
        "Other members of the Council believed that this uncertainty mainly results from the build-up of public debt in many countries.",
        "While analysing the factors raising the uncertainty as to the outlook for economic growth in the world, some Council members also pointed to the faster growth of retail sales as well as of CPI and PPI inflation in China, which may indicate a growing imbalance in this economy.",
        "Those members argued that due to strong trade links between China and the euro area a possible weakening of economic activity in China would have negative effects on economic growth in the euro area and, consequently, also in Poland.",
        "While addressing the monetary policy of major central banks it was emphasised that they were gradually withdrawing non-standard monetary policy measures.",
        "At the same time, it was assessed that due to the still weak economic recovery in the world and low inflationary pressure in major developed economies, interest rate hikes in those economies should not be expected in the coming period.",
        "It was also pointed out that the monetary policy in some countries of the region had been further eased in the recent period.",
        "On the other hand, some Council members emphasised that in certain developed economies the interest rate hiking cycle had already begun.",
        "While discussing the situation in the Polish economy it was pointed out that in 2009 Q4 the annual growth of domestic demand was still relatively slow and GDP growth was primarily driven by net exports.",
        "At the same time, it was assessed that in the light of the latest monthly data the economic recovery primarily concerned industry, i.e.",
        "the sector most deeply affected by the economic downturn.",
        "It was also pointed out that retail sales data were lower than expected and that the construction and assembly output had fallen strongly in the first months of 2010, though – at the same time – it was assessed that those data could have been distorted by unfavourable weather conditions and in subsequent months some improvement could be expected.",
        "Some Council members suggested that the decline in the growth of retail sales may point to a delayed adjustment of the households’ demand to the conditions of economic downturn.",
        "Moreover, some Council members argued that the fact that lending to the enterprise sector was markedly lower than a year ago could signal slow growth of this sector’s investment.",
        "Other members of the Council, however, assessed that the rising trend of some consumer sentiment indicators observed in the past few months may be signalling a recovery in consumer demand in the coming period.",
        "They also argued that a low growth of loans to enterprises reflected their low demand for credit due to their very good financial results and high liquidity.",
        "In the opinion of those Council members, such assessment could be supported by the results of NBP economic climate surveys, according to which in 2009 Q4 the percentage of enterprises applying for loans declined, while the share of approved loan applications increased.",
        "Moreover, they assessed that in the coming period the rise in housing loans to households may accelerate once again, which was indicated by commercial banks’ forecasts.",
        "While discussing developments in consumer prices of goods and services, a marked decline in annual CPI inflation in February 2010 was pointed to, driven by a fall in annual price indices of fuel, energy commodities and food, and by a decline in core inflation.",
        "Some members of the Council emphasised that in the light of available forecasts inflation in the coming months would continue to decline, driven mostly by statistical base effects connected with a strong rise of administered prices in 2009, the appreciation of the zloty observed so far, moderate growth of unit labour costs and the currently low demand pressure.",
        "They indicated that the demand pressure was low due to the still unfavourable situation in the labour marked, reflected in a fall in the number of working persons according to the BAEL in 2009 Q4 and in a limited wage increase, and also due to the slow growth of loans to the non-financial sector.",
        "Other members of the Council indicated that an inflation decline in the coming period may be curbed by a rise in the prices of energy commodities in the world markets and the prices of natural gas for individual subscribers in the domestic market.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members, in the longer run the inflationary pressure would be rising due to the growing demand pressure connected with the economic recovery and the public finance sector imbalance, as well as due to a possible rise in wage pressure in a part of this sector.",
        "Some Council members also pointed out that despite the decline, in the recent period inflation had been higher than previously forecasted.",
        "The prospects for Poland’s compliance with the Maastricht price stability criterion were also addressed at the meeting.",
        "Some Council members stressed that the 12-month average HICP inflation, considered while assessing the compliance with the Maastricht price stability criterion, exceeded significantly the estimated reference value for this criterion.",
        "Those members also pointed out that a continuation of the positive differences between the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices and the Consumer Price Index observed over the past year and a possible future inclusion of the prices of owner-occupied housing services in the HICP could affect the outlook for Poland’s meeting of the price stability criterion.",
        "The Council paid much attention to developments of the zloty exchange rate, which had strengthened significantly in the recent period.",
        "Some Council members assessed that the pace of zloty appreciation might have been excessive, arguing that since February 2009 the zloty had strengthened more than other currencies of the region.",
        "They pointed out that the zloty appreciation increased the restrictiveness of monetary conditions in Poland and might adversely affect the competitiveness of Polish exports decelerating the pace of economic recovery.",
        "It was also stressed that a fast appreciation of the exchange rate raised the risk of its increased volatility in the future.",
        "Other members of the Council assessed that the movements of the zloty exchange rate and of other currencies of the region were largely influenced by the situation in international financial markets and that the recent strengthening of the zloty was associated with a fall in global risk aversion.",
        "They also pointed out that the zloty appreciation was supported by the inflow of foreign capital into the Polish Treasury securities market, which was associated with large borrowing needs of the state budget.",
        "Those members argued that due to the higher scale of the earlier zloty depreciation connected with the financial crisis than in the case of other currencies of the region, the exchange rate of the zloty did not exceed the estimated equilibrium exchange rate despite the recently observed appreciation.",
        "According to these members of the Council, the current level of the zloty exchange rate did not significantly reduce the competitiveness of Polish exports, which was confirmed – in their view – by NBP studies showing improvement in exporting companies’ assessments of their current and expected situation.",
        "Moreover, those members pointed out that the competitiveness of exports was positively affected by a decline in unit labour costs in industry.",
        "They also assessed that the growth of Polish exports was more dependent on trade growth in countries that are Poland’s major trading partners than on the exchange rate level, although at the same time they stressed that the high exchange rate volatility may have an adverse effect on the development in the sector producing internationally tradable goods compared to the non-tradable goods sector.",
        "Council members pointed to the unfavourable situation in the public finance sector, as evidenced by the very high cumulative budget deficit recorded by local government units in 2009 and a central budget deficit reaching a relatively high level relative to the full-year plan in the first two months of 2010.",
        "Some Council members assessed that a possible continuation of weak consumer demand would be conducive to reducing VAT revenues and increasing the budget deficit.",
        "According to those Council members, in the light of available data the consolidation measures planned by the government may prove insufficient to reduce the public finance sector imbalances in line with the objectives outlined in the Convergence Programme – 2009 Update.",
        "At the same time, those members emphasised that in case these problems aggravated, an outflow of foreign capital could occur that would be conducive to a weakening of the zloty.",
        "The Council assessed that a moderate inflationary pressure over the monetary policy transmission horizon and uncertainty as to the outlook for economic growth in the world and in Poland, combined with the appreciation of zloty exchange rate so far, justified keeping NBP interest rates unchanged at the current meeting.",
        "While addressing future decisions on the NBP interest rates, some members of the Council declared that in view of a risk of an excessive zloty appreciation leading to a surge in the restrictiveness of monetary conditions, their temporary easing by lowering the NBP interest rates could be considered.",
        "Some Council members argued that in the current situation an interest rate cut was unjustified and it could contribute to higher volatility of prices in the financial markets.",
        "Moreover, in the assessment of the majority of the Council, a temporary reduction of the NBP interest rates would necessitate a stronger monetary tightening in the longer term.",
        "The Council kept the interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 3.50%, the lombard rate at 5.00%, the deposit rate at 2.00%, the rediscount rate at 3.75% and the discount rate at 4.00%.",
        "At the meeting, the Monetary Policy Council discussed primarily the outlook for economic growth and inflation abroad and in Poland, the situation in the labour and credit markets and zloty exchange rate developments.",
        "While addressing the outlook for global economic growth, it was pointed out that the latest data on US and euro-area economies indicated the continuation of positive tendencies in industry and a further improvement of enterprises’ sentiment.",
        "At the same time, it was argued that the still difficult situation in labour markets in those economies could negatively affect consumption, which may be signalled by unfavourable data on retail sales.",
        "The Council stressed that high uncertainty as to the scale of recovery in the world economy continued.",
        "Some Council members pointed primarily to the expected phasing out of stimulus packages in many countries as a source of uncertainty related to the sustainability of the recovery.",
        "According to other Council members, the persistently high fiscal deficit and fast rising public debt remain to be important risk factors.",
        "At the same time, the Council assessed that economic activity in developing economies, whose demand may prove important in supporting the recovery in developed economies, would be of great significance for global economic growth.",
        "While discussing inflation abroad, it was pointed out that an increase in the annual price indices of consumer goods and services in the United States and in the euro area in December 2009 had resulted mainly from the positive base effect connected with a strong drop in energy prices a year before.",
        "Some Council members emphasised that according to most forecasts inflation in those economies would remain at a relatively low level in the coming years, which would be conducive to lower inflation in the world economy.",
        "Other Council members, however, pointed to the rising inflation expectations in the United States.",
        "Moreover, they argued that the output gap in the largest developing economies was closing, which could limit the decline in the prices of goods imported from those countries and its disinflationary influence on inflation both in the world and in Poland.",
        "At the meeting the Council also discussed the situation in the world commodity markets.",
        "It was assessed that commodity prices in the years to come may be relatively high.",
        "In this context, some Council members pointed out that commodity markets may see long price cycles, as supply can only be increased as a result of significant investments, and so it adjusts to a demand rise with a considerable lag.",
        "Moreover, other Council members argued that commodity prices were not only affected by demand and supply in the underlying market but also by the situation in the markets of financial instruments tied to commodity prices, including, among others, by the purchases of those instruments by foreign pension funds.",
        "In the assessment of those Council members, the lack of limits on open positions may be conducive to high commodity prices despite relatively sluggish growth in the world economy.",
        "While discussing the situation in the Polish economy, it was emphasised that the released data, and in particular the gradual stabilisation of employment in the enterprise sector and improved indicators of economic climate, including output forecasts, as well as good liquidity and financial standing of enterprises, signalled a gradual recovery in economic activity.",
        "Yet, some Council members pointed out that the data on industrial output in December 2009 fell significantly short of expectations.",
        "While addressing the outlook for economic growth in Poland, the majority of the Council argued that GDP growth in subsequent quarters may be stronger than previously assessed.",
        "At the same time some Council members stressed that, while assessing the pass-through of the expected GDP growth acceleration to inflation, one should consider a possible slowdown in the growth of potential output, stemming in particular from the decline in total factor productivity growth started in 2004.",
        "Moreover, it was pointed out that according to the NBP survey the share of non-profitable exports in total exports was very low, which means that enterprises may be able to sustain their price competitiveness even in the case of zloty appreciation.",
        "On the other hand, it was emphasised that the impact of the exchange rate on the profitability of exports was currently lower than it used to be due to the strengthening of international ties among enterprises and a considerable import intensity of exports.",
        "Some Council members indicated, however, that a potential zloty appreciation might – in the short run – have a strong negative impact on GDP growth as it could trigger the build-up of inventories of imported goods.",
        "Other Council members pointed to the expected continuation of relatively weak economic growth in Poland's main trading partners, which may curb export growth and, consequently, GDP growth.",
        "In the opinion of those Council members, due to the significance of external demand and international ties among enterprises, economic growth in Poland at the moment was much more dependent on economic activity abroad as compared to the period of the previous economic slowdown.",
        "While addressing the factors affecting investments, some Council members emphasised that since production capacity utilisation in the enterprise sector was still low and – as during recovery from the previous economic slowdown – investments respond to improvement in economic activity with some delay, no quick investment recovery should be expected.",
        "It was also argued that investment in the coming period would depend on spare production capacities not only in Poland but also in other countries with strong ties with Polish enterprises, and particularly in Germany.",
        "This means that despite the positive sentiment of investors towards emerging countries, including Poland, the inflow of foreign direct investment in the coming years may – in the opinion of those Council members – prove significantly lower than it had been before the global crisis.",
        "Other Council members, however, pointed out that according to the NBP survey on economic climate the utilisation of production capacities in 2009 Q4 was close to that observed in 2003-2004, when after the previous economic slowdown investments rebounded, which could signal a faster than expected investment recovery.",
        "While analysing labour market data, the Council members argued that the deterioration of the situation in this market was considerably less pronounced than in the period of the previous slowdown, which was confirmed by a markedly higher current ratio of vacancies to the number of unemployed.",
        "Such a situation increases the risk of wage rise acceleration taking place faster than during recovery from the previous economic slowdown.",
        "Some Council members assessed that in the coming years demographic developments would negatively affect labour supply, while in the case of the previous economic slowdown they had been conducive to curbing the wage pressure and, consequently, the inflationary pressure.",
        "Moreover, the decline in the share of enterprises lowering their margins observed in 2009 Q4, and a probable – in the opinion of those Council members – margin increase in the phase of economic recovery, indicate that inflation may rise even if a low growth rate of unit labour costs was sustained.",
        "Other Council members pointed out that, due to the rise in the unemployment rate, moderate (after adjustment for one-off effects) wage growth and good financial conditions in enterprises, no significant inflationary pressure from the labour market should be expected in the coming period.",
        "In this context, the so-called labour hoarding on the part of enterprises was being emphasised, which consists in reduced lay-offs during an economic slowdown, which in the period of recovery should allow for increasing labour productivity and meeting rising demand without a significant employment rise, and probably also without significant pay increases.",
        "In the opinion of those Council members, this may be a factor easing the inflationary pressure.",
        "Some Council members pointed out that the situation in the credit market was not improving: lending to the enterprise sector continued to shrink, while the rise in loans to the household sector remains considerably lower than in the previous years.",
        "Other Council members, however, argued that, according to the preliminary results of the NBP survey of commercial banks, their tendency to tighten credit policy had been halted in 2009 Q4 and in 2010 banks expected to significantly increase lending to the non-financial sector.",
        "While discussing the outlook for lending, some Council members pointed to a significant increase in loans granted in foreign currencies that had been observed prior to the crisis in the world financial markets.",
        "Those members emphasised that it was possible that lending in foreign currencies would rise significantly once again, which may be limiting the impact of NBP interest rate changes on the volume of credit in the economy.",
        "While discussing inflation developments, some Council members pointed out that in December 2009 CPI inflation rose to 3.5% (driven primarily by the positive base effect connected with a strong decline in fuel prices in December 2008), and in the coming months inflation might be expected to decrease significantly.",
        "At the same time, it was emphasised that core inflation net of food and energy prices had fallen to 2.6% due to the deceleration in prices of services.",
        "While addressing inflation expectations, some Council members pointed to a rise in the majority of indices of individuals’ inflation expectations recorded in January 2010 and to the deteriorated structure of responses to the question about expected change of prices in the next 12 months.",
        "Those Council members assessed that the slightly widened spread of forecasts by bank analysts and the continuation of a relatively high dispersion of individuals’ expectations may reveal some uncertainty as to the assessment of inflationary processes by economic agents.",
        "Other Council members argued that inflation expectations in Poland are adaptive in nature, and so they are greatly dependent on past inflation, which should be taken into consideration while interpreting their changes.",
        "In the context of inflation expectations and their pass-through to wage developments, the Council also discussed the power of trade unions, which play a significant role in wage negotiations in the public sector, though in the scale of the whole economy they group a relatively small number of employees.",
        "The Council also discussed the zloty exchange rate developments against its equilibrium level.",
        "Some Council members argued that a high level of integration of the Polish economy with the euro area should be conducive to reducing the deviations of the real zloty exchange rate from the equilibrium rate.",
        "Other members of the Council pointed out that in their decisions on emerging markets foreign investors often rely on a very limited set of information, which may result in exchange rate deviations from the level warranted by fundamental factors.",
        "At the same time some Council members indicated that public finance sector imbalances, both in Poland and abroad, was a factor increasing the risk of high zloty exchange rate volatility.",
        "While considering decisions on the NBP interest rates in the months to come, some Council members assessed that the expected economic growth acceleration would be a factor conducive to higher inflation in the medium term.",
        "In the opinion of those Council members, this may indicate that a time might be approaching for considering a change in the assessment of probabilities of inflation in the medium term running below or above the inflation target and, possibly, the subsequent monetary policy tightening.",
        "Other Council members, however, argued that, taking into account uncertainty as to the sustainability of the recovery in the world and in the Polish economy, as well as the unknown impact of the expected macroeconomic policy tightening abroad on future world economic growth and inflation, the probabilities of inflation running below and above the target in the medium term were still balanced and the NBP interest rates should remain unchanged in the coming period.",
        "The Council assessed that the data on the economic situation in Poland and abroad released since its last meeting warranted maintaining the interest rates unchanged at the current meeting.",
        "The Council kept the interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 3.50%, the lombard rate at 5.00%, the deposit rate at 2.00%, the rediscount rate at 3.75% and the discount rate at 4.00%."

    "2019": [
        "During the meeting, the Council stated that global economic growth had probably continued at a relatively slow pace in 2019 Q1, although economic conditions had improved slightly in some of the largest economies.",
        "It was observed that industrial confidence indicators were still weak, while more upbeat signs were coming from the services sector.",
        "Some Council members judged that there was persistent uncertainty about the global economic outlook, which stemmed, most notably, from changes in the trade policy of the largest economies.",
        "The Council members pointed out that economic activity growth in the euro area, including Germany, remained rather weak, despite a pick-up in quarterly GDP growth in 2019 Q1.",
        "With regard to economic conditions in the United States, it was noted that they remained good, and quarterly GDP growth in 2019 Q1 had been higher than in the previous quarter.",
        "At the same time, it was stressed that this owed much to a sharp rise in inventories, amid flagging imports.",
        "It was also noted that the stabilisation of economic activity growth in China was a positive sign, which probably, to a large extent, resulted from the stimulus implemented by the country's authorities.",
        "It was indicated that although no tangible pick-up in global economic growth had been observed, oil prices continued to rise gradually.",
        "The Council members judged that this was primarily the result of supply-side factors.",
        "It was pointed out that the rise in global oil prices had translated into somewhat higher inflation in many countries.",
        "At the same time, it was underlined that core inflation in the environment of the Polish economy, including the euro area, had also increased slightly.",
        "Referring to monetary policy abroad, it was observed that following a considerable easing of its rhetoric in March, the communication of key central banks regarding future monetary conditions had not changed, which reflected the persistence of concerns about the economic outlook.",
        "In particular, it was pointed out that the European Central Bank was keeping interest rates close to zero, including the deposit rate below zero, and was reinvesting maturing securities bought under the asset purchase programme.",
        "The ECB also reiterated its forward guidance about the expected period of interest rates remaining at the current level until at least the end of the year, and about additional TLTRO operations to be launched in September.",
        "In the recent period, the Federal Reserve also kept interest rates unchanged, while the markets started to expect interest rate cuts in the United States in the quarters to come.",
        "Meanwhile, the Fed began to gradually limit its balance sheet reduction.",
        "While assessing developments in Poland’s real economy, it was observed that economic conditions remained favourable, although – according to the GUS flash estimate – GDP growth in 2019 Q1 had been somewhat weaker than in previous quarters.",
        "The Council members pointed out that activity growth continued to be supported by consumption, which had been rising further – albeit at a slightly slower pace than in previous quarters – fuelled by increasing employment and wages, as well as very strong consumer sentiment, and which had been accompanied by investment growth.",
        "While discussing the outlook for economic growth in the coming quarters, the Council members voiced the opinion that GDP growth in 2019 might be higher than suggested by the March projection.",
        "Some Council members pointed out that GDP growth in 2019 Q1 had proved higher than expected and that business sentiment had recently improved, which was also a sign of a favourable outlook for domestic economic activity.",
        "It was observed that the very strong position of employees in the labour market and the government's fiscal programmes worked consistently in the same direction.",
        "However, these Council members pointed out that the PMI in industry remained below the 50 point threshold, which signalled uncertainty about further activity growth in this sector, including the risk of the slowdown abroad possibly affecting the situation in Poland more strongly.",
        "It was emphasised that the key source of risk for the domestic economy was the scale and persistence of the activity slowdown in Poland's main trading partners.",
        "When analysing labour market performance, it was indicated that robust employment growth was sustained in the corporate sector, and that the unemployment rate had continued to decline, hitting further historical lows.",
        "Certain Council members suggested that this translated into persistent tensions in the labour market, reflected in the reported recruitment problems, and wage demands of various occupational groups.",
        "Yet it was observed that despite this, wage growth across the economy had slowed down to 7.1% in 2019 Q1 (compared with 7.7% in 2018 Q4), which was in part the effect of somewhat weaker wage growth in the corporate sector.",
        "Certain Council members expressed the concern that in future the situation in the labour market might start to translate, in a more pronounced way, into price pressure.",
        "Turning to inflation developments in Poland, it was observed that consumer price growth had increased in recent months.",
        "The Council members emphasised that despite this, inflation continued to run at moderate levels.",
        "It was pointed out that the rise in inflation was partially caused by the increase in fuel and food prices, resulting, to a great extent, from an increase in global oil prices, as well as the effects of reduced supply of pork in China, combined with the adverse influence of last year's drought on the prices of certain vegetables – i.e.",
        "factors beyond the impact of monetary policy.",
        "At the same time, it was underlined that core inflation had risen as well.",
        "It was noted that the increase in core inflation was partially driven by the strong performance of the Polish economy, although it was also the effect of the expiry of one-off factors curbing its growth so far.",
        "Certain Council members pointed out that inflation net of food and energy prices had exceeded 1.5%, thus the NBP reference rate deflated with that index turned mildly negative.",
        "However, other Council members emphasised that real interest rates on loans from commercial banks and credit institutions remained significantly positive.",
        "Some Council members observed that inflation should stabilise in the following months at a level close to that recorded in April and would remain moderate.",
        "In the opinion of certain Council members, favourable demand conditions, which still prevailed in the Polish economy, as reflected in rising service prices, would drive inflation up.",
        "These Council members pointed out that amid high resource utilisation in the economy, it was difficult to assess how long companies would be able to keep narrowing the profit margins in order to avoid passing the rising costs through to prices.",
        "According to these Council members, inflation in the subsequent quarters might also be propelled by increased social expenditure, even if growth in other expenditure of the general government sector was to slow down.",
        "Other Council members judged that the inflationary effect of higher social spending should be relatively small, especially in view of its potential allocation to savings.",
        "These Council members also remarked that strong price competition and the weakening GDP growth anticipated in the following quarters would curb inflationary pressures.",
        "Some Council members underscored that developments in global oil prices and domestic energy prices in the subsequent years constituted an uncertainly factor.",
        "While analysing inflation expectations, it was remarked that the structure of responses to questions in the surveys of both companies and households had not changed markedly of late.",
        "The Council members emphasised that market participants’ long-term inflation expectations remained anchored close to the inflation target.",
        "While discussing monetary policy, the Council decided that interest rates should remain unchanged.",
        "In the Council’s assessment, the outlook for economic conditions in Poland remains favourable, although the coming quarters may see a gradual slowdown in GDP growth.",
        "At the same time, inflation will continue at a moderate level and will remain close to the target in the monetary policy transmission horizon.",
        "Thus, the Council judged that the current level of interest rates was conducive to keeping the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic stability.",
        "The majority of the Council members expressed the opinion that, taking into account current information, interest rates were also likely to remain stable in the coming quarters.",
        "These Council members pointed out that their assessment was supported by current forecasts indicating a limited risk of a lasting deviation of price growth from the inflation target.",
        "They emphasised that another argument in favour of keeping interest rates stable was the heightened uncertainty about the scale and duration of the slowdown in the global economy, along with its feeding through to domestic economic conditions.",
        "Some Council members stressed that there were factors which, in the medium term, could push inflation to higher levels than suggested by the current forecasts.",
        "They remarked that should the announced fiscal measures, a potential pick-up in wage growth, or a possible increase in energy prices result in a marked rise in inflation that would jeopardise meeting the inflation target in the medium term, it might be justified to consider an increase in the NBP interest rates in the coming quarters.",
        "A view was also expressed that in the hypothetical event of a slump in economic activity accompanied by a marked deterioration in consumer and corporate sentiment, in the longer run it might be justified to consider a decrease in interest rates or the introduction of unconventional monetary policy instruments.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 1.50%, the lombard rate at 2.50%, the deposit rate at 0.50%, the rediscount rate at 1.75%.",
        "During the meeting, the Council stated that global economic growth continued at relatively slow pace.",
        "It was noted that industrial confidence indicators remained weak and the volume of world trade was declining.",
        "However, this was accompanied by relatively good business conditions in services.",
        "Attention was also drawn to the heightened uncertainty about the global economic outlook for the coming quarters, to a large extent a result of further possible changes in the trade policy of the largest economies.",
        "It was also judged that the risk prevails of a stronger weakening of global economic activity than predicted by current forecasts.",
        "The Council members pointed out that economic activity growth in the euro area, including Germany, remained weak.",
        "It was stated that although GDP growth in the German economy was higher in 2019 Q1 than at the end of 2018, this was partly the result of temporary factors.",
        "It was underlined that in view of the still weak business conditions in German industry, the available forecasts point to a low growth rate for this economy in 2019.",
        "Referring to economic conditions in the United State, it was indicated that they currently remain good.",
        "When analysing economic situation in China, it was pointed out that although GDP growth stabilised in this economy in 2019 Q1, recent data indicate the risk of some weakening in economic conditions in the current quarter.",
        "It was indicated that in the recent period the heightened uncertainty about the outlook for global economic growth had contributed to a fall in global oil prices following their earlier significant rise.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that in recent months there had been a marked increase in the prices of certain food products.",
        "When referring to inflation abroad, attention was drawn to some increase in price growth in many countries in April.",
        "It was underlined that core inflation had also risen somewhat in the external environment of the Polish economy, including in the euro area.",
        "Some Council members judged that the increase in price growth was probably temporary.",
        "Certain Council members pointed out that inflation in emerging market economies remained higher than in advanced ones.",
        "Referring to monetary policy abroad, it was pointed out that the major central banks – in view of concerns about a deterioration in economic conditions – were easing their rhetoric regarding future monetary policy.",
        "The European Central Bank was keeping interest rates close to zero, including the deposit rate below zero, and also reiterated its forward guidance about keeping interest rates at the current level in the coming quarters.",
        "Moreover, the ECB continued to reinvest maturing securities bought under the asset purchase programme and had announced additional TLTRO operations to be launched in September.",
        "The Federal Reserve also kept interest rates unchanged, amid growing expectations of interest rate cuts this year.",
        "Meanwhile, the Fed began to gradually limit its balance sheet reduction.",
        "While discussing developments in Poland’s real economy, it was observed that economic conditions remained favourable.",
        "It was pointed out that in 2019 Q1 annual GDP growth reached 4.7% and was higher than the forecast.",
        "The Council members underlined that activity growth continued to be supported by consumption, which had been rising further – albeit at a slightly slower pace than in previous quarters – fuelled by increasing employment and wages, as well as very strong consumer sentiment.",
        "At the same time, it was stated that in 2019 Q1 investment in the economy had risen significantly.",
        "Attention was also drawn to the high growth in investment outlays among medium-sized and large enterprises, which suggested a significant recovery in investment in the enterprise sector.",
        "It was emphasised that despite the weakening of economic conditions in Poland’s immediate environment, marked export growth continued in 2019 Q1, and net exports made a positive contribution to GDP growth.",
        "Export growth was supported by the recovery in foreign sales to countries outside the euro area, which – in the opinion of some Council members – might indicate that enterprises were adjusting to the weakening economic conditions in their immediate environment and shifting some production to other markets.",
        "The Council members also drew attention to the continued sound financial situation of the enterprise sector.",
        "They noted that some decline in net profits in 2019 Q1 was mainly the result of a deterioration of the situation in the energy and mining sectors.",
        "However, in the overwhelming majority of the remaining sectors financial results had improved.",
        "It was also emphasised that the positive financial situation of companies was reflected in the stable level of their profit on sales.",
        "While analysing the outlook for economic growth, the Council members judged that GDP growth in 2019 might be slightly higher than expected in the March projection.",
        "It was noted that economic growth would continue to be driven by growth in consumer demand, which is supported by the very optimistic consumer sentiment in view of the favourable labour market conditions for consumers and the social benefits already introduced and announced by the government.",
        "Some Council members judged that the scale of the impact on the Polish economy of the slowdown abroad might be weaker than previously expected – as was the case so far.",
        "However, other Council members noted that there was a risk of a weakening of activity in the industrial sector over the coming months.",
        "This was indicated by the PMI index staying below the 50 point level and the results of other business surveys, suggesting that activity growth in industry had thus far been sustained by the clearing of previously accumulated production arrears.",
        "It was emphasised that the key source of risk for the domestic economy was the scale and persistence of the activity slowdown in Poland's main trading partners and the strength of its pass-through to the Polish economy.",
        "When analysing labour market performance, it was indicated that unemployment remained very low.",
        "Alongside that, employment in the enterprise sector continued to grow at a relatively fast pace.",
        "In turn, according to the LFS, the number of working persons in 2019 Q1 was slightly lower than a year earlier.",
        "In the opinion of the Council members, the discrepancies between the data of the enterprise sector and the LFS might partly result from the growing share of employees from the East among the newly employed, and also from changes in the forms of employment.",
        "Some Council members judged that the recent data from the labour market – including about the number of new job offers – might suggest that growth in demand for labour was weakening.",
        "Concurrently, wage growth – both in the enterprise sector and in the whole economy – remained stable at close to 7%.",
        "Certain Council members expressed the opinion that the stabilisation of wage growth was backed by the social programmes that had been introduced, raising household disposable income and thus limiting wage pressure.",
        "Turning to inflation developments in Poland, it was observed that in recent months consumer price growth had risen, yet remained at a moderate level.",
        "It was pointed out that the rise in inflation was partially caused by the increase in fuel and food prices.",
        "It was emphasised that core inflation had also risen, which reflected a marked pick-up in growth in the prices of services amid continued favourable situation of Polish consumers.",
        "Certain Council members pointed out that the price growth observed by some households might be higher than CPI inflation calculated for the average household.",
        "Some Council members observed that inflation in the coming months should remain close to the level seen in May.",
        "It was also emphasised that uncertainty existed regarding inflation developments at the beginning of 2020.",
        "It was pointed out that in the case of an adjustment of electricity prices for households to market conditions, consumer price growth in 2020 Q1 might increase.",
        "Certain Council members judged that such an increase might lead to higher inflation expectations.",
        "Other Council members observed, however, that the increase in inflation at the beginning of 2020 – should it occur – would be short-lived, and later in 2020 inflation would probably run close to the target.",
        "Some Council members emphasised that global developments in oil and food prices in the coming years posed a factor of uncertainty.",
        "Certain Council members pointed out that the NBP reference rate deflated with both CPI and inflation net of food and energy prices was currently negative.",
        "These Council members judged that this contributed to an increase in lending to households amid high – in their opinion – indebtedness of these entities.",
        "Other Council members, in turn, emphasised that the real interest rates on household loans were still significantly positive.",
        "At the same time, these Council members expressed the opinion that the growth in lending to households was supported by their good financial situation, which improved their creditworthiness.",
        "In the opinion of these Council members, growth in claims of the banking sector on households remained moderate.",
        "Attention was also drawn to the relatively low growth in corporate investment loans, which – in the opinion of certain Council members – might be the effect of limited supply on the part of banks.",
        "Yet some Council members judged that growth in these loans was limited by low demand, resulting from the significant scale of investment being self-financed by enterprises.",
        "While discussing monetary policy, the Council decided that interest rates should remain unchanged.",
        "In the Council’s assessment, the outlook for economic conditions in Poland remains favourable, and GDP growth in 2019 may be slightly higher than expected in the March projection.",
        "At the same time, inflation will continue at a moderate level and will remain close to the target in the monetary policy transmission horizon.",
        "Thus, the Council judged that the current level of interest rates was conducive to keeping the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic stability.",
        "The majority of the Council members expressed the opinion that, taking into account current information, interest rates were also likely to remain stable in the coming quarters.",
        "These Council members pointed out that their assessment was supported by current forecasts indicating a limited risk of a lasting deviation of price growth from the inflation target.",
        "They emphasised that another argument in favour of keeping interest rates stable was the heightened uncertainty about the scale and duration of the slowdown in the global economy, along with its feeding through into domestic economic conditions.",
        "Some Council members stressed that there were factors which, in the medium term, could push inflation to higher levels than suggested by the current forecasts.",
        "They remarked that should the announced fiscal measures, a potential pick-up in wage growth, or a possible increase in energy prices result in a marked rise in inflation that would jeopardise meeting the inflation target in the medium term, it might be justified to consider an increase in the NBP interest rates in the coming quarters.",
        "A view was also expressed that in the hypothetical event of a slump in economic activity accompanied by a marked deterioration in consumer and corporate sentiment, in the longer run it might be justified to consider a decrease in interest rates or the introduction of unconventional monetary policy instruments.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 1.50%, the lombard rate at 2.50%, the deposit rate at 0.50%, the rediscount rate at 1.75%.",
        "During the meeting, the Council pointed out that activity growth in the global economy remained relatively soft, and the global economic outlook had deteriorated.",
        "The volume of world trade was declining, which, combined with the announcements of further measures to increase trade barriers was reflected in the persistently weak performance of the industrial sector.",
        "At the same time, although business conditions in the service sector remained relatively strong, incoming data pointed to their possible deterioration in the months to come.",
        "It was underlined that as a result, uncertainty about the global economic outlook for the coming quarters had risen in recent months.",
        "Some Council members observed that besides changes in the trade policy of key economies, it was probably the tendency of slowdown in economic growth after years of expansion that negatively affected activity in many countries.",
        "The Council members observed that GDP growth in the euro area in 2019 Q2 continued to be sluggish.",
        "Attention was drawn to the fact that although the performance of the service sector continued to be strong, activity in the industrial sector was decreasing.",
        "It was pointed out that euro area growth continued to be mainly driven by consumer demand, supported by relatively strong consumer sentiment and the improvement in the labour market conditions compared to previous years.",
        "However, industrial output, particularly sensitive to conditions in international trade, was on the decline.",
        "Some Council members judged that in the quarters to come, the persistent downturn in industry might start negatively weighing on household sentiment and translate into weaker activity in services.",
        "It was stressed that GDP had shrunk in Germany in 2019 Q2 in quarter-on-quarter terms, and forecasts pointed to a possible further GDP fall in 2019 Q3.",
        "Certain Council members observed at this point that the German Finance Minister had signalled its readiness to apply a fiscal stimulus should the German economy face a crisis.",
        "Referring to economic conditions in the United States, it was indicated that while GDP growth in 2019 Q2 was higher there than in the euro area, it had slowed down on previous quarters.",
        "Some Council members observed at that point that business climate indicators in this economy signalled a possible further weakening of activity in the subsequent quarters, which gave rise to downward revisions of 2019 GDP forecasts for the United States.",
        "Certain Council members pointed out that many indicators already suggested a growing risk of recession in the United States in the coming quarters.",
        "They underlined that a potential recession in the United States would have a highly adverse effect on the global economic outlook, especially the outlook for euro area, Germany, and, hence, also Poland.",
        "With regard to the economic situation in the external environment of the Polish economy, it was noted that in China GDP growth had also decelerated in 2019 Q2, hitting the lowest point since 1992.",
        "While discussing the situation in the global commodity markets, it was observed that in recent months global oil prices had declined.",
        "Certain Council members pointed out that prices had declined despite mounting geopolitical tensions.",
        "It was underlined that the development of crude oil extraction and transport capacity in the United States had a stabilising effect on the market.",
        "Some Council members pointed out that the fall in oil prices was the result of a slowdown in global economic growth and the persistence of negative signals regarding the global economic outlook.",
        "It was emphasised that lower oil prices were also reflected in lower inflation in the largest advanced economies and a strong decline in inflation expectations in these countries.",
        "Referring to monetary policy abroad, attention was drawn to the fact that many central banks had started monetary policy easing.",
        "It was underlined that the European Central Bank was keeping its interest rates close to zero, including the deposit rate below zero, and was reinvesting maturing securities bought under the asset purchase programme, while signalling the possibility of monetary policy easing in the near future.",
        "It was also noted that the Federal Reserve had cut interest rates in July 2019 and in August had stopped reducing its balance sheet.",
        "Certain Council members judged that, despite the cautious rhetoric of the Fed regarding further interest rate cuts, it should be expected that the Federal Reserve would continue its monetary policy easing in the coming months.",
        "It was noted that fears about the future economic conditions were having a negative impact on financial market sentiment, leading to growing uncertainty and volatility in the prices of financial instruments, and causing a sharp fall in the yields on debt securities.",
        "As a result, at present a significant portion of government bonds in advanced countries have negative yields.",
        "When discussing developments in Poland’s real economy, it was observed that, despite flagging growth abroad, domestic economic conditions remained favourable, and GDP growth in 2019 Q2 amounted to 4.5% y/y.",
        "Rising consumption, fuelled by increasing employment and wages, very strong consumer sentiment and disbursement of benefits, continued to boost economic activity growth.",
        "It was noted that investment also increased in 2019 Q2, despite some slowdown in growth.",
        "At the same time, the growth rate of exports and imports declined.",
        "While analysing the outlook for economic growth, the Council members judged that GDP growth should continue at a relatively high pace in the coming years, although probably somewhat lower than forecast in the July projection.",
        "It was noted that economic growth would still be supported by expanding consumer demand.",
        "In this context, certain Council members drew attention to the positive impact of the fiscal stimulus on GDP growth.",
        "However, some Council members observed that business climate indicators pointed to the possibility of a slowdown in the industrial sector activity over the coming months.",
        "These Council members noted that amid a slowdown abroad and weaker inflow of funds from the European Union, there could be softer growth in investment.",
        "It was noted that the key source of risk for domestic economic activity was the scale and persistence of the downturn in the euro area, including in Germany.",
        "When analysing labour market performance, it was indicated that employment growth in the enterprise sector had decreased and that there was no further increase in wage growth.",
        "Some Council members judged that this might signal a stabilisation of labour demand.",
        "According to these Council members, wage growth in the economy as a whole was still not a factor which could lead to excessive price growth, since due to a significant rise in labour productivity, unit labour cost growth remained low.",
        "Turning to inflation developments in Poland, it was noted that consumer price growth remained moderate.",
        "It was pointed out that in August 2019 – according to the GUS flash estimate – inflation stood at 2.8% y/y.",
        "Attention was drawn to the fact that price growth was boosted mainly by the significant increase in food prices, partly resulting from the ASF epidemic in China and the drought in Poland, thus due to factors beyond the control of domestic monetary policy.",
        "In turn, lower energy prices, including fuel prices, than a year ago had a curbing effect on price growth.",
        "At the same time, core inflation remained at a moderate level.",
        "Some Council members emphasised that inflation was in line with the NBP inflation target, while core inflation – despite accelerating – remained significantly lower than CPI inflation.",
        "These Council members pointed out that prices of services were rising faster than in previous years, but that this was partly due to the high growth in administered prices, and partly reflected real convergence processes.",
        "Other Council members noted that the relatively high growth in the prices of services was also the result of supply barriers, amid relatively strong demand growth.",
        "In the opinion of these Council members, there was a similar situation in the construction industry, where many companies were reporting high capacity utilisation.",
        "At the same time, it was underlined that PPI inflation had declined in recent months and was currently very low.",
        "While analysing the outlook for inflation, some Council members emphasised that, according to the latest NBP forecasts, price growth would probably rise only slightly by the end of 2019, while in 2020 Q1 inflation might temporarily rise close to the upper limit of deviations from the inflation target.",
        "These Council members underlined that inflation growth at the beginning of 2020 would largely result from the statistical base effect and the assumed increase in energy prices.",
        "It was underlined that – according to current forecasts – in the successive months of 2020 inflation would, however, decline, falling to levels close to 2.5% in the middle of the year.",
        "However, certain Council members drew attention to the need to monitor the changes in inflation expectations.",
        "Certain Council members pointed out that the NBP reference rate deflated by both CPI and inflation net of food and energy prices was currently negative.",
        "These Council members argued that very low interest rates reduced the propensity of households to save and encouraged them to search for more profitable, albeit riskier forms of investing their savings.",
        "In the opinion of these Council members, low interest rates have a negative impact on the performance of the banking sector, which strengthens the tendency to concentrate banking activity in market segments yielding high margins.",
        "In this context, attention was drawn, on the one hand, to the relatively high growth in consumer and housing loans, and on the other hand, to low growth in corporate loans.",
        "Yet other Council members stressed that the real interest rates on loans in Poland are significantly positive.",
        "While discussing monetary policy, the majority of the Council members decided that interest rates should remain unchanged.",
        "In the opinion of these Council members, the outlook for economic conditions in Poland remains favourable, and GDP growth will continue at a relatively high rate in the coming years, although it will gradually decline.",
        "However, uncertainty about the scale and persistence of the slowdown abroad and its impact on domestic economic activity had increased.",
        "At the same time, after a temporary rise in 2020 Q1, inflation will remain close to the target in the monetary policy transmission horizon.",
        "Thus, the majority of the Council members judged that the current level of interest rates was conducive to keeping the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic stability.",
        "The majority of the Council members expressed the opinion that, taking into account current information, interest rates were also likely to remain stable in the coming quarters.",
        "These Council members pointed out that their assessment was supported by current forecasts indicating a limited risk of a lasting deviation of price growth from the inflation target, amid the forecast gradual slowdown in economic growth.",
        "Certain Council members pointed to factors that might boost inflation higher than indicated by the current forecasts.",
        "They noted that should there be a significant rise in inflation that would jeopardise meeting the inflation target in the medium term, it might be justified to consider an increase in the NBP interest rates in the coming quarters.",
        "In the opinion of these Council members, uncertainty about the economic outlook and future price growth had risen.",
        "Certain Council members noted that in recent months there were more signs of a deterioration in the global economic conditions, including a significant increase in the risk of recession in the US economy.",
        "In the opinion of these Council members, these factors could also have a negative impact on economic growth in Poland.",
        "At the same time, the risk of a lasting deviation of inflation from the NBP target was limited.",
        "As a result, a view was expressed that it was justified to lower interest rates at the current meeting.",
        "The view was also upheld that in the longer run it might be justified to consider a further decrease in interest rates or the introduction of unconventional monetary policy instruments.",
        "At the meeting a motion to cut the NBP interest rates by 0.25 percentage points was submitted.",
        "The motion was rejected The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 1.50%, the lombard rate at 2.50%, the deposit rate at 0.50%, the rediscount rate at 1.75%.",
        "During the meeting, the Council noted that incoming data pointed to weaker economic conditions in some of the largest economies, and assessed that uncertainty about the outlook for global activity in the coming quarters had increased.",
        "The majority of the Council members indicated that GDP growth in the euro area in 2018 Q4 had remained low, and forecasts pointed to its further deterioration in 2019.",
        "They also highlighted the markedly, in their view, weaker economic growth, and the drop in business climate indicators in the German economy, Poland's most important trading partner.",
        "Certain Council members voiced the opinion that the weakening of the economic conditions observed in the immediate environment of the Polish economy was not significant and probably of temporary nature, while the drop in economic climate indicators resulted partly from political uncertainty.",
        "With reference to the economic situation in the United States, it was observed that it remained strong, although GDP growth was expected to decelerate somewhat during the year.",
        "Attention was also drawn to the continued gradual decline in activity growth in China.",
        "It was noted that although oil prices had risen since the beginning of the year, they were still lower than in 2018 Q3.",
        "The increase in oil prices was, to a large extent, driven by lower oil production in Iran and Venezuela and the announcement of a further reduction in oil supply from Saudi Arabia.",
        "Meanwhile, the scale of the rise in oil prices was limited by the deteriorating outlook for demand for oil related to weaker global economic conditions and tensions between the United States and China.",
        "When analysing price growth abroad, it was indicated that lower than in 2018 Q3 oil prices were having a downward effect on inflation in many countries.",
        "It was noted that currently core inflation abroad, including the euro area, was low.",
        "Referring to monetary policy abroad, it was observed that the ECB had been keeping interest rates close to zero, including the deposit rate below zero for 4.5 years.",
        "At the same time, the ECB is reinvesting funds from the maturing securities.",
        "Some Council members assessed that in light of the deteriorating economic outlook in the euro area, the ECB programme of liquidity provision to the banking sector might be expanded, while the indicated period of keeping ECB interest rates at the current level might be extended.",
        "It was pointed out that the US Federal Reserve was keeping interest rates unchanged while signalling that its further decisions would depended on the incoming data.",
        "Some Council members expressed the opinion that the US economy also might not see further interest rate increases, and that already this year the Federal Reserve might halt the process of balance sheet reduction.",
        "Discussing the developments in Poland’s real economy, it was underlined that GDP growth in 2018 Q4 had remained relatively robust.",
        "It was noted that activity growth had continued to be driven by consumption, which had been rising further – albeit at a slightly slower pace than in previous quarters – fuelled by increasing employment and wages as well as very strong consumer sentiment.",
        "It was emphasised that this was accompanied by growing investment.",
        "While discussing the outlook for economic growth, it was stressed that the recently received data pointed to a likely lower activity growth in 2019 Q1 compared to previous quarters.",
        "The results of the March NBP projection indicated that economic growth may gradually decline also in the subsequent quarters, although the economic conditions this year will remain favourable.",
        "It was emphasised that weaker economic conditions in Poland's immediate environment would have a negative impact on domestic GDP growth.",
        "At the same time, according to the March projection, the scale of the economic slowdown in Poland would be smaller than previously forecast due to the expected positive impact of the fiscal measures announced by the government on domestic demand.",
        "Certain Council members expressed the opinion that GDP growth in 2019 might be higher than projected.",
        "These members emphasised that given the announced fiscal stimulus and the stabilization of electricity prices, robust growth in consumer demand would probably continue.",
        "Moreover, the adverse impact of the weaker economic conditions abroad on the domestic activity would probably be mitigated by Polish firms' high capability to adapt to the changing market environment.",
        "The Council members judged that the outlook for the economic growth would continue to be subject to significant uncertainty, with developments in the global economy constituting the key risk factor for the expected GDP growth path.",
        "When analysing labour market performance, it was noted that, while according to the LFS data, the increase in the number of working persons in the economy had flattened in 2018 Q4, corporate sector data for January 2019 pointed to further employment growth in the corporate sector.",
        "At the same time, wage growth in the economy in 2018 Q4, and in the corporate sector in January 2019 remained close to 7%.",
        "It was indicated that according to the March projection, a similar rate of wage growth was to be expected also in the subsequent quarters.",
        "Certain Council members judged that wage growth might be higher due to the possible further increase in wage pressure in the public sector and a decrease in labour supply.",
        "Some Council members emphasised at that point that a potential rise in wage growth in the economy would support consumer demand and – given the expected economic activity slowdown – would have a stabilising effect on economic conditions.",
        "At the same time, other Council members argued that in the light of the anticipated economic slowdown and after two years of a robust wage growth, the likelihood of a further acceleration in wage growth was relatively low.",
        "Turning to inflation developments in Poland, it was pointed out that – notwithstanding relatively high economic growth and wages rising faster than in previous years – annual consumer price growth had declined in recent months and was currently running low.",
        "It was remarked that inflation net of food and energy prices also continued to be low, despite a likely pick-up in January.",
        "While discussing the outlook for inflation, it was emphasised that in line with the March projection, price growth in 2019 would continue at a pace close to that of 2018 and thus was expected to be markedly lower than envisaged in the November projection.",
        "The downward revision of the expected inflation resulted from the freeze on electricity prices as well as lower levels of global oil prices than in 2018 Q3.",
        "The likely remaining of core inflation at relatively low levels, despite its expected gradual increase, would be another factor curbing price growth.",
        "It was pointed out that according to the March projection, CPI inflation in subsequent years would exceed this year's level while remaining moderate and close to 2.5%.",
        "Some Council members were of the opinion that price growth in the years to come might be higher than currently forecast.",
        "They noted that in the medium term price growth might be boosted by a range of factors, including stronger effects of the announced fiscal measures than suggested by the projection – especially if high capacity utilisation should continue and energy price growth and wage growth should accelerate.",
        "Certain Council members assessed that the path of global oil prices posed another risk factor for inflation.",
        "However, other Council members argued that the expected economic slowdown, which reduced the likelihood of higher wage momentum in the economy, would hamper price growth.",
        "These members also emphasised that under weak economic conditions, firms' propensity to raise prices would probably be limited, especially amid the continuously favourable – although varying across industries – average profitability of their operations.",
        "The Council decided that interest rates should remain unchanged.",
        "In the Council’s assessment, the outlook for economic conditions in Poland remains favourable.",
        "It was pointed out that in line with the results of the March NBP projection, a gradual slowing in GDP growth was expected in the quarters ahead.",
        "At the same time, inflation will continue at a moderate level and will remain close to the inflation target in the monetary policy transmission horizon.",
        "Thus, the Council judged that the current level of interest rates was conducive to keeping the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic and financial system stability.",
        "The majority of the Council members expressed the opinion that, taking into account current information, interest rates were also likely to remain stable in the coming quarters.",
        "These Council members pointed out that this assessment was supported by the results of the March NBP projection indicating a limited risk of a lasting deviation of price growth from the inflation target.",
        "They emphasised that another argument in favour of keeping interest rates stable was the heightened uncertainty about the scale and duration of the slowdown in the global economy, along with its feeding through to domestic economic conditions.",
        "Certain Council members stressed that there were factors which, in the medium term, could push inflation to higher levels than assumed in the projection.",
        "They remarked that should the announced fiscal measures or a potential pick-up in wage growth result in a marked rise in inflation that would jeopardise meeting the inflation target in the medium term, it might be justified to consider an increase in the NBP interest rates in the coming quarters.",
        "A view was also expressed that in the hypothetical event of a slump in economic activity accompanied by a marked deterioration in consumer and corporate sentiment, in the longer run it might be justified to consider a decrease in interest rates or the introduction of unconventional monetary policy instruments.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 1.50%, the lombard rate at 2.50%, the deposit rate at 0.50%, the rediscount rate at 1.75%.",
        "During the meeting, the Council pointed out that activity growth in the global economy remained relatively soft.",
        "Industrial confidence indicators continued to be weak and the volume of world trade was declining.",
        "At the same time, although business conditions in the service sector remained relatively strong, incoming data pointed to their possible deterioration in the months to come.",
        "This was accompanied by heightened uncertainty about the global economic outlook for the coming quarters, resulting in part from further possible changes in the trade policy of the largest economies.",
        "The Council members observed that activity growth in the euro area continued to be sluggish.",
        "Attention was drawn to subdued business conditions in the euro area industry, with an emphasis on the decline in industrial output in Germany in the recent period.",
        "This was accompanied by the consistently strong performance of the service sector.",
        "However, some Council members judged that the persistent downturn in industry might gradually start weighing on household sentiment, thus posing a downside risk to activity in services.",
        "It was stressed that according to available forecasts, GDP growth in the euro area would be markedly slower in 2019 than a year ago.",
        "Some Council members perceived a substantial risk that growth in the area might be lower than the forecasts, particularly if tariffs on the exports of some European products to the United States would be imposed.",
        "Referring to economic conditions in the United States, it was pointed out that they remained good.",
        "At the same time, recent readings of business climate indicators in this economy signalled a possible weakening of activity in the subsequent quarters, and available forecasts pointed to a gradual decline in GDP growth.",
        "In turn, when analysing the economic situation in China, it was noted that incoming data were indicative of weaker economic conditions in 2019 Q2.",
        "While discussing the situation in the global commodity markets, it was observed that in the recent period heightened volatility of oil prices had persisted, yet those prices remained lower than a year ago.",
        "Parallel to that, global prices of some food products had risen.",
        "It was emphasised that in many countries inflation remained at moderate levels.",
        "It was highlighted that inflation in the euro area had declined recently, and core inflation was running below 1%.",
        "Referring to monetary policy abroad, attention was drawn to a marked shift in the rhetoric of the main central banks in recent months.",
        "It was observed that the Federal Reserve, while keeping interest rates unchanged so far, was gradually limiting the pace of its balance sheet reduction and was signalling the possibility of a monetary policy easing in the subsequent quarters.",
        "The European Central Bank was keeping its interest rates close to zero, including the deposit rate below zero, and was reinvesting maturing securities bought under the asset purchase programme.",
        "At the same time, the ECB had extended the indicated period of keeping interest rates unchanged, while signalling the possibility of further monetary policy easing.",
        "Some Council members additionally observed that in Central and Eastern Europe – despite inflation running above the targets in some of the economies – central banks had not signalled a tightening of monetary policy.",
        "When discussing developments in Poland’s real economy, it was observed that economic conditions remained favourable.",
        "Rising consumption, fuelled by increasing employment and wages, very strong consumer sentiment and disbursement of benefits, continued to boost economic activity growth.",
        "Incoming data also point to a further substantial rise in investment and exports.",
        "While analysing the outlook for economic growth, the Council members judged that GDP growth should continue at a relatively high pace in the coming years.",
        "Economic growth would still be supported by expanding consumer demand growth.",
        "Some Council members assessed that business climate indicators signalled the possibility of weaker conditions in the industrial sector in subsequent months.",
        "These Council members also expressed the opinion that export growth might slow down as well, should household sentiment deteriorate and consumer demand in the immediate environment of the Polish economy weaken.",
        "These Council members additionally observed that in the event of a more pronounced slowdown in the euro area, GDP growth in Poland might be slower than forecast in the July NBP projection.",
        "However, other Council members argued that economic growth might run above the level expected in the July projection.",
        "They assessed that in the quarters to come the impact of the slowdown abroad on the Polish economy might be – as it had been so far – limited and weaker than expected.",
        "When analysing labour market performance, it was indicated that employment growth in the enterprise sector had decreased in May.",
        "Some Council members judged that this might signal a stabilisation of labour demand.",
        "At the same time, despite somewhat faster growth in May, wages in the industrial sector rose at a relatively stable pace.",
        "The Council members emphasised that the change in regulations on the employment of nonEU employees in Germany was an uncertainty factor to the future labour market situation in Poland.",
        "It was pointed out that it might cause an outflow of some Ukrainian workers from the Polish market, yet the scale of this phenomenon was difficult to estimate.",
        "Certain Council members assessed that the reduction in the number of Ukrainian employees active in the Polish labour market, coupled with the expected by those Council members acceleration of wage growth in the government sector might contribute to higher wage growth across the economy, and consequently to higher price growth.",
        "In contrast, other Council members expressed the opinion that, given the expected gradual decline in GDP growth in Poland, the risk of accelerating wage growth and inflation was small.",
        "Turning to inflation developments in Poland, it was noted that consumer price growth had risen in recent months, yet remained at a moderate level.",
        "The rise in inflation was partially caused by higher price growth of fuel and food.",
        "This was accompanied by a rise in core inflation.",
        "Some Council members emphasised that core inflation had increased moderately and remained significantly lower than CPI inflation.",
        "Certain Council members observed that the rise in core inflation – along with higher growth in prices of goods sensitive to domestic economic conditions and prices of services – was an indication of the build-up of demand pressure in the economy.",
        "While analysing the outlook for inflation, some Council members emphasised that, according to the NBP projection, price growth over almost the whole projection horizon would remain close to 2.5%, except for the beginning of 2020, when – due to the impact of temporary factors beyond the control of domestic monetary policy – it might be higher, although still below the upper limit of deviations from the target.",
        "These Council members pointed out that the above developments would be accompanied by only a gradual rise in core inflation.",
        "Some Council members expressed the opinion that in the case of a more pronounced slowdown in GDP growth in the euro area – and consequently, in Poland – price growth might be lower than the forecast.",
        "However, certain Council members pointed out that the inflation path in the NBP July projection was higher than in the NBP March projection, with price growth running in the upper band for deviations from the target during most of the forecast period.",
        "They expressed the opinion that inflation growth in the coming years might be fuelled by a further rise in the growth of prices of services, expected by these Council members, as well as stronger pass-through of rising costs of enterprises to prices of final products.",
        "These Council members judged that the expected higher inflation at the beginning of 2020 might become persistent and that price growth in the whole projection horizon might be higher than the forecast.",
        "Certain Council members pointed out that the NBP reference rate deflated by both CPI and inflation net of food and energy prices was currently negative.",
        "These Council members observed that in view of the forecast rise in inflation, the stabilisation of the NBP interest rates would lead to a further fall in real interest rates, which would stimulate lending.",
        "However, other Council members noted that real interest rates in Poland were among the highest in Europe and that lending growth was moderate and slower than growth in deposits.",
        "While discussing monetary policy, the majority of the Council members decided that interest rates should remain unchanged.",
        "In the opinion of these Council members, the outlook for economic conditions in Poland remains favourable, and GDP growth will continue at a relatively high rate in the coming years.",
        "At the same time, inflation will remain moderate and will stay close to the target in the monetary policy transmission horizon.",
        "Thus, the majority of Council members judged that the current level of interest rates was conducive to keeping the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic stability.",
        "The majority of the Council members expressed the opinion that, taking into account current information, interest rates were also likely to remain stable in the coming quarters.",
        "These Council members pointed out that their assessment was supported by current forecasts indicating a limited risk of a lasting deviation of price growth from the inflation target.",
        "They emphasised that another argument in favour of keeping interest rates stable was the continued heightened uncertainty about the scale and duration of the slowdown in the global economy, along with its feeding through into domestic economic conditions.",
        "Some Council members stressed that in the event of significant price growth that would jeopardise meeting the inflation target in the medium term, it might be justified to consider an increase in the NBP interest rates in the coming quarters.",
        "However, certain Council members judged that the economic growth and inflation would most likely be higher than indicated by the current projection.",
        "In their assessment, as a result, inflation might exceed the target in the coming years.",
        "Moreover, along with the expected rise in price growth, the level of real interest rates would decline, which could – in the opinion of these Council members – excessively stimulate lending and create the problem of over-indebtedness of households.",
        "In the view of these Council members, in order to maintain price stability and limit household lending growth, it would be advisable to increase NBP interest rates at the current meeting of the Council.",
        "A view was also expressed that in the hypothetical event of a slump in economic activity accompanied by a marked deterioration in consumer and corporate sentiment, in the longer run it might be justified to consider a decrease in interest rates or the introduction of unconventional monetary policy instruments.",
        "At the meeting a motion to raise the NBP interest rates by 0.25 percentage points was submitted.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 1.50%, the lombard rate at 2.50%, the deposit rate at 0.50%, the rediscount rate at 1.75%.",
        "During the meeting, the Council noted that global economic conditions have remained favourable so far, although incoming data suggest their weakening in some economies, and higher uncertainty about the scale of the expected global slowdown.",
        "It was pointed out that in the euro area, following a decline in GDP growth in 2018 Q3, some survey indicators continued to deteriorate.",
        "In particular, a marked weakening was visible in the activity and survey indicators for Germany, which is Poland's main trading partner.",
        "It was emphasised that in the United States, economic conditions were still very strong in 2018 Q4, yet 2019 forecasts point to slower growth also in this economy.",
        "It was observed that in China activity growth has been gradually slowing down as well.",
        "It was pointed out that heightened uncertainty about the scale of weakening of the global outlook continued to have an adverse effect on some asset prices.",
        "In the last months of 2018, fears about the global economic slowdown contributed also to a decline in the prices of commodities, including oil.",
        "At the same time, it was observed that lower oil production in OPEC member states boosted oil prices somewhat at the beginning of 2019.",
        "When analysing inflation developments abroad, it was pointed out that the marked decline in oil prices between the beginning of October and the end of December translated into lower inflation in many countries.",
        "Alongside that, core inflation in the external environment of the Polish economy, including the euro area, remained moderate.",
        "Referring to monetary policy in the external environment of the Polish economy, it was noted that the ECB was keeping interest rates close to zero, including the deposit rate below zero.",
        "Although in 2018 the ECB terminated the net purchase of financial assets, it will continue to reinvest the funds from the maturing securities.",
        "At that point, some Council members presented the opinion that given the deteriorating economic conditions in the euro area and a downward revision of the core inflation path anticipated for the euro area, the period in which the ECB will continue to keep its policy rates very low will probably be extended.",
        "Other Council members additionally assessed that the termination of the net asset purchase programme by the ECB is an uncertainty factor for this economy.",
        "In turn, the Federal Reserve of the United States raised interest rates in December 2018.",
        "Some Council members reaffirmed their opinion that in this economy too, due to the risk of a sharper than previously expected slowdown, interest rates might not be raised further, as indicated by the softer rhetoric of the Federal Reserve representatives in this regard.",
        "Discussing the developments in Poland’s real economy, it was underlined that incoming data are indicative of economic conditions remaining strong so far.",
        "It was noted that activity growth continued to be driven by rising consumption, albeit at a slightly slower pace than in previous quarters, fuelled by increasing employment and wages, together with very strong consumer sentiment.",
        "It was pointed out that this was accompanied by rising investment.",
        "With regard to the outlook for domestic economic activity, it was emphasised that despite the anticipated deceleration in GDP growth, it remained relatively favourable, and the expected slowdown abroad would be the key factor adversely affecting GDP growth.",
        "At the same time, some Council members drew attention to a decline in the PMI index related to lower indicators of output and new orders, including export orders.",
        "Those Council members judged this to be a sign of higher uncertainty about future GDP growth in Poland.",
        "Some Council members pointed out that the smaller inflow of foreign employees, related, among others, to changes in Germany’s immigration policy, could in the longer term have a hampering effect on Poland's output growth.",
        "Certain Council members reiterated their opinion that GDP growth in 2019 might be higher than currently forecast.",
        "While analysing developments in the labour market, it was pointed out that the unemployment rate remained low, which at the end of 2018 was accompanied by accelerated wage growth both in the whole economy and the corporate sector.",
        "It was noted that this probably resulted from a pick-up in wage growth in the public sector, but also from the shifts in payments of bonuses in the mining sector.",
        "Certain Council members stressed that most firms covered by NBP surveys report wage growth exceeding labour productivity growth.",
        "These Council members also remarked that pay rises for the successive groups of employees in the public sector may pose a risk of faster wage growth and thus higher inflation.",
        "At the same time, some Council members assessed that higher wage growth, amid the potential weakening of external demand, may have a stabilising effect on economic conditions and support inflation at levels close to the target.",
        "Discussing inflation developments in Poland, it was underlined that despite the relatively fast GDP growth and higher wage growth than in the previous year, the annual consumer price growth, including core inflation, was markedly lower than forecast.",
        "It was noted that in December, inflation was running below the lower limit for deviations from the inflation target.",
        "Similarly, producer price growth proved lower than forecast.",
        "Turning to the near-term outlook for inflation, it was highlighted that this changed significantly due to the adoption at the end of 2018 of a law reducing the excise duty and transitional fee related to energy, as well as introducing compensation payments for electricity providers designed to keep electricity prices charged to end-consumers in 2019 at the level of mid-2018.",
        "It was pointed out that as a result, the rise in wholesale energy prices observed in 2018 should not feed through, either directly or indirectly, to the 2019 inflation.",
        "It was remarked that in 2019 inflation would be additionally limited by lower oil prices than earlier forecast.",
        "Yet certain Council members pointed out that the fall in global oil prices may not fully translate into a fall in domestic fuel prices due to the structure of the fuel market in Poland.",
        "Certain Council members also indicated higher than in previous quarters coal prices as a factor which might boost households' maintenance costs in 2019.",
        "However, taking into account all new information received since the previous meeting of the Council, it was assessed that inflation in 2019 might be markedly lower than could earlier be expected.",
        "With reference to the anticipated path of price developments in the medium term, the majority of the Council members were in agreement that within the monetary policy transmission horizon inflation would remain close to the target.",
        "These Council members noted that the expected slowdown in GDP growth in the coming years, coupled with high competition in retail trade, would have a curbing effect on price growth.",
        "Other Council members pointed to the expected increase in core inflation, including service price growth, in the quarters to come, and to the risk of a substantial rise in energy prices in the future.",
        "Moreover, certain Council members indicated the recent rise in firms' and households' inflation expectations, which – should it prove lasting – may be a factor boosting inflation in the following years.",
        "Other Council members judged that inflation expectations at the end of 2018 were probably heavily influenced by debates about levels of energy prices, and so their rise could prove temporary.",
        "Summing up the conclusions following from the analysis of the macroeconomic developments in 2018, the Council members highlighted that economic growth in Poland remained high, and inflation declined slightly compared to 2017.",
        "It was pointed out that lending to the private sector had been rising at a moderate pace, external trade had continued to post a surplus and the public sector debt to GDP ratio had probably diminished.",
        "Some Council members underlined that the declining ratio of public debt to GDP was supported not only by fiscal policies, but also by good economic conditions and a stable interest rates.",
        "Long-term inflation expectations remained anchored at the inflation target, while the annual average exchange rate of the zloty against the euro did not change in relation to 2017, despite periodic turmoil in the global financial markets.",
        "In the opinion of the Council, the data for 2018 confirm very good economic conditions in the Polish economy, accompanied by price stability and the absence of macroeconomic imbalances.",
        "When discussing NBP monetary policy, the Council decided that interest rates should remain unchanged.",
        "In the Council's assessment, current information indicates a relatively favourable outlook for economic conditions in Poland, although a gradual slowing in GDP growth is expected in the years ahead.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that according to current forecasts, the annual price growth will probably increase in the coming months, however – due to the decline in oil prices and the freeze on electricity prices – the scale of this increase will be significantly smaller than that expected in the November projection.",
        "In the medium term, the expected slowdown in economic growth will have a dampening effect on inflation.",
        "As a result, in the monetary policy transmission horizon inflation will remain close to the target.",
        "Thus, the Council judged that the current level of interest rates was conducive to keeping the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic stability.",
        "The majority of the Council members expressed the opinion that, taking into account current information, interest rates were also likely to remain stable in the coming quarters.",
        "These Council members pointed out that this assessment was supported by the limited risk of inflation permanently exceeding the target, along with a likely weakening of economic conditions globally and in Poland.",
        "Certain Council members emphasised that currently significant uncertainty existed about developments in the CPI index in the medium term.",
        "These Council members pointed out that should incoming data indicate a significant and lasting increase in inflation expectations and wage demands translating into price pressure, which would make successive projections suggest that inflation will remain above the target in the monetary policy transmission horizon, it might be justified to consider an increase in the NBP interest rates in the coming quarters.",
        "However, these Council members pointed out that the likelihood of such a scenario had declined in recent months.",
        "A view was also expressed that in the hypothetical event of a slump in economic activity accompanied by a marked deterioration in consumer and corporate sentiment, in the longer run it might be justified to consider a decrease in interest rates or the introduction of unconventional monetary policy instruments.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 1.50%, the lombard rate at 2.50%, the deposit rate at 0.50%, the rediscount rate at 1.75%.",
        "During the meeting, the Council noted that incoming data pointed to weaker economic conditions in some of the largest economies.",
        "At the same time, uncertainty had increased about the outlook for global activity in the coming quarters.",
        "It was noted that GDP growth in the euro area in 2019 Q4 remained low, and economic prospects for the region had slightly deteriorated.",
        "The recent weakening was particularly marked in the Germany, Poland's most important trading partner.",
        "Attention was also drawn to the continued gradual decline in activity growth in China.",
        "With regard to the United States, it was indicated that despite slower GDP growth in 2018 Q4, economic conditions in that economy remained strong.",
        "It was pointed out that, following a sharp decline in the final quarter of 2018, oil prices had rebounded slightly since the beginning of the year.",
        "The rise in oil prices was supported by restrictions on oil production in OPEC countries, along with the continued sanctions on oil imports from Iran and Venezuela.",
        "Meanwhile, the scale of the rise in oil prices was limited by both lower current demand and the deteriorating outlook for demand for oil related to weaker global economic conditions and tensions between the United States and China.",
        "When analysing inflation developments abroad, it was indicated that the decline in oil prices on their 2018 Q3 levels was having a downward effect on inflation in many countries.",
        "At the same time, core inflation in the environment of the Polish economy, including the euro area, was currently low.",
        "Referring to monetary policy in the external environment of the Polish economy, it was noted that the ECB was keeping interest rates close to zero, including the deposit rate below zero for 4,5 years.",
        "At the same time, the ECB was reinvesting funds from the maturing securities.",
        "It was pointed out that amid weaker economic conditions in the euro area and higher uncertainty about their prospects, the ECB had softened its rhetoric at its last meeting, making further decisions contingent on incoming data.",
        "Some Council members judged that the likelihood of interest rate increases in the euro area had diminished substantially.",
        "It was indicated that after raising interest rates in December 2018, the Federal Reserve of the United States was keeping them unchanged and, at the last meeting, had eased its stance regarding monetary policy prospects as well.",
        "Some Council members expressed the opinion that this economy also might not see further interest rate increases, and it was even possible that the process of balance sheet reduction by the Federal Reserve could be halted.",
        "Discussing the developments in Poland’s real economy, it was underlined that preliminary data on 2018 GDP confirmed very good performance of the Polish economy last year.",
        "The consistently high private consumption growth was highlighted, resulting in substantial increase in the level of consumption over the past two years.",
        "It was pointed out that robust economic growth last year did not entail the build-up of macroeconomic imbalances.",
        "It was noted that 2018 had seen a continuous surplus in foreign trade, with growth in lending to the non-financial sector, though higher than in 2017, remaining moderate, and annual inflation standing at 1.6%.",
        "With regard to economic growth in 2018 Q4, it was pointed out that preliminary annual national accounts data suggested further relatively high GDP growth in that period, although slightly weaker than in the previous quarters.",
        "It was noted that activity growth in 2018 Q4 had continued to be driven by consumption, which had been rising further – albeit at a slightly slower pace than in previous quarters – fuelled by increasing employment and wages as well as very strong consumer sentiment.",
        "It was emphasised that in 2018 Q4 investment growth had also continued, although it was being hampered by the likely decline in investment outlays by local government units.",
        "It was underlined that national accounts data pointed to a positive contribution of net exports to GDP growth in 2018 Q4, despite weaker economic conditions abroad.",
        "While discussing the outlook for economic growth, it was stressed that the recently received data pointed to a probable slowdown in 2019 Q1.",
        "The Council reiterated its assessment that – despite some weakening of the outlook for growth in the immediate environment of the Polish economy – GDP growth in Poland in the coming quarters would probably decrease only gradually, and domestic economic conditions would remain relatively favourable, although uncertainty about future GDP growth had increased in the recent period.",
        "When analysing labour market performance, attention was drawn to a gradual decline in employment growth.",
        "In the assessment of some Council members, this could have reflected not only supply constraints, but also weaker growth in demand for labour.",
        "It was pointed out that in December wage growth in the enterprise sector had slowed, which – in the opinion of some Council members – might suggest that temporary factors had driven its prior rise.",
        "These Council members also assessed that despite the mounting wage pressure declared by enterprises, wage growth in the corporate sector should remain stable in the coming quarters, owing to firms' probably lower propensity to raise wages amid weaker external demand.",
        "The opinion was expressed that despite that, higher wage growth in the entire economy could not be ruled out, particularly if wage growth in the public sector picked up.",
        "Some Council members emphasised at that point that a potential increase in wage growth across the economy, given the expected slowdown in GDP growth, might have a stabilising effect on economic conditions.",
        "Discussing the long-term determinants of the developments in the Polish labour market, some Council members highlighted the persistently stronger growth of labour productivity than that of real median and mode wage in the past.",
        "Certain Council members judged that such a discrepancy had resulted from the increasing participation of Polish firms in global value chains and technological progress.",
        "Other Council members observed that labour productivity growth was currently slower than real wage growth, and the occurrence of the reverse relationship in the past did not have to affect firms' current pricing policies.",
        "Turning to inflation developments in Poland, it was pointed out that – notwithstanding relatively high economic growth and wages rising faster than in previous years – annual consumer price growth had declined in recent months and remained moderate.",
        "It was noted that lower global oil prices than in 2018 Q3 were dragging on price growth, although, as certain Council members believed, their impact on fuel prices was constrained by the structure of the fuel market in Poland.",
        "It was also indicated that inflation net of food and energy prices remained low.",
        "Certain Council members were of the opinion that the persistently low core inflation in the environment of higher wage growth than in previous years resulted from the likely slower growth of the median wage, which might have a significant impact on inflation developments.",
        "While discussing the near-term outlook for inflation, it was underlined that according to current forecasts, annual price growth would pick up in the coming months, yet the scale of this increase would be small and markedly lower than expected in the November projection.",
        "It was noted that in line with these forecasts, average inflation this year would be lower than 2.5%.",
        "Certain Council members remarked that in the coming months, rising food prices would probably have a boosting effect on inflation, with the scale of the increase remaining an uncertainty factor for price developments.",
        "Some Council members were of the opinion that price growth might be weaker than currently forecast due to – as they expected – the absence of a marked pick-up in core inflation amid weakening economic growth.",
        "Certain Council members, however, expressed the view that rising production costs might contribute to higher inflation as the relatively low, in their opinion, profitability in some branches could incline firms to raise prices.",
        "Other Council members, in turn, pointed out that profitability in the corporate sector remained close to that observed in previous years, and the propensity of firms to raise prices would be mitigated by strong competition.",
        "With reference to the anticipated path of price developments in the medium term, it was indicated that in the monetary policy transmission horizon inflation would remain close to the target.",
        "It was pointed out that the expected slowdown in GDP growth in the coming years would have a dampening effect on inflation.",
        "It was also indicated that after a temporary rise in December, household inflation expectations had declined again.",
        "Some Council members assessed that the increase in inflation expectations of enterprises at the end of 2018 might also be temporary.",
        "Yet other Council members expressed the opinion that possible persistence of inflation expectations of enterprises at a heightened level could be a factor contributing to higher inflation in the years to come.",
        "They also pointed to the risk of energy price growth in the future.",
        "Certain Council members assessed that in the coming years the impact of factors that had so far curbed price growth, such as the increase in the number of discount stores and change in the structure of consumption, might weaken.",
        "The Council decided that interest rates should remain unchanged.",
        "In the Council's assessment, current information indicates a relatively favourable outlook for economic conditions in Poland, although a gradual slowing in GDP growth is expected in the years ahead.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that according to current forecasts, the annual price growth would increase in the coming months, however – due to the lower oil prices than in 2018 Q3 and the freeze on electricity prices – the scale of this increase would be significantly smaller than that expected in the November projection.",
        "In the medium term, the expected slowdown in economic growth will have a dampening effect on inflation.",
        "As a result, in the monetary policy transmission horizon inflation will remain close to the target.",
        "Thus, the Council judged that the current level of interest rates was conducive to keeping the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic stability.",
        "The majority of the Council members expressed the opinion that, taking into account current information, interest rates were also likely to remain stable in the coming quarters.",
        "These Council members pointed out that this assessment was supported, in particular, by a marked decline in the risk of inflation permanently exceeding the target, along with a rise in uncertainty about the scale and duration of the slowdown in the global economy, as well as its feed-through to domestic economic conditions.",
        "Certain Council members emphasised that significant uncertainty remained about developments in the CPI index in the medium term.",
        "These Council members pointed out that should incoming data indicate a significant and lasting increase in inflation expectations and wage demands which would boost inflation to a level that would jeopardise meeting the inflation target, it might be justified to consider an increase in the NBP interest rates in the coming quarters.",
        "These Council members pointed out that the likelihood of such a scenario had declined significantly in recent months.",
        "A view was also expressed that in the hypothetical event of a slump in economic activity accompanied by a marked deterioration in consumer and corporate sentiment, in the longer run it might be justified to consider a decrease in interest rates or the introduction of unconventional monetary policy instruments.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 1.50%, the lombard rate at 2.50%, the deposit rate at 0.50%, the rediscount rate at 1.75%.",
        "During the meeting, the Council noted that incoming data confirmed weaker growth in some of the largest economies, which was particularly visible in world trade and industrial sector activity.",
        "It was also underlined that the outlook for global economic conditions in the coming quarters remained uncertain.",
        "The majority of the Council members indicated that growth in the euro area had most probably remained low at the beginning of the year, after sluggish GDP growth in 2018 Q4.",
        "This is suggested by the latest output data and confidence indicators, which turned out to be weaker than expected.",
        "The Council members pointed out that the deteriorating economic conditions were particularly visible in the German economy, which recorded a further fall in export orders and a continued slowdown in automotive industry.",
        "At the same time, it was underlined that favourable conditions for consumption growth, including an ongoing employment and wage growth, and in 2019 also an easing of fiscal policy in Germany, have a stabilising effect on the European and German economy.",
        "It was noted that in the United States economic conditions remained good, although GDP growth probably slowed down in 2019 Q1.",
        "This was partly due to temporary factors, but forecasts for the whole year point to a lower growth of the US economy than that recorded in 2018.",
        "In China, activity growth continues to decline gradually.",
        "However, it was noted that this was accompanied by measures undertaken by the Chinese authorities aimed at mitigating the scale of the slowdown.",
        "The Council members underlined that the deterioration of the global economic conditions was reflected in the change of monetary policy stance of the major central banks.",
        "In view of the downward revisions of GDP and inflation forecasts for the coming years in the euro area and the United States, both the ECB and the Fed have softened their communication on future monetary conditions.",
        "In particular, it was noted that the ECB had extended the expected period of keeping interest rates unchanged, including the deposit rate below zero, and had announced the launch of additional operations providing liquidity to the banking sector.",
        "At the same time, the ECB continues to reinvest the funds from the maturing securities.",
        "In turn, the Fed has stopped signalling further interest rate hikes in 2019 and has announced it will stop reducing the size of its balance sheet in the coming quarters.",
        "Certain Council members pointed out that the US bond yield curve inverted at the end of March 2019, which might be related to deteriorating expectations of financial market participants regarding the US economic conditions and, in effect, the emergence of expectations of monetary policy easing by the Fed.",
        "It was also noted that although oil prices had risen since the beginning of the year, they were still lower than in 2018 Q3, which was keeping inflation at a moderate level in many countries.",
        "It was indicated that core inflation in the environment of the Polish economy, including the euro area, remained low.",
        "Discussing the developments in Poland’s real economy, it was underlined that economic conditions remained favourable in Poland, although incoming data indicated lower GDP growth in 2019 Q1 than in 2018 Q4.",
        "The Council members noted that activity growth was driven by rising consumption – albeit at a slightly lower rate than in previous quarters – fuelled by increasing employment and wages, as well as very high consumer sentiment.",
        "It was stressed that this was accompanied by a rise in investment.",
        "While discussing the growth outlook, some Council members pointed out that in the first months of the year data on output and retail sales proved better than expected, which could result in somewhat higher GDP growth in 2019 Q1 than estimated in the March projection.",
        "However, some Council members pointed out that corporate sentiment indicators remained relatively low, which – in the opinion of these Council members – might indicate that there is a risk that in the coming months the slowdown abroad could have a stronger impact on the situation in the Polish industrial sector.",
        "It was noted that the major source of risk for the performance of the Polish economy was the scale and duration of the slowdown in its main trading partners.",
        "Certain Council members underlined that so far Polish exports had proven to be relatively resistant to the slowdown abroad, and indicated that in the recent period GDP growth forecasts for Poland had even been revised upwards somewhat.",
        "At the same time, attention was drawn to the improvement in consumer sentiment in March, which may have been boosted by the announced increase in fiscal expenditures.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members, along with further growth in employment and wages, this will act as a factor supporting consumption.",
        "The Council members expressed the view that GDP growth in 2019 might be higher than indicated in the March projection.",
        "When analysing labour market performance, it was pointed out that employment growth in the corporate sector was still close to 3% at the beginning of 2019, while wage growth in enterprises in January and February 2019 amounted to approx.",
        "Certain Council members indicated the persistent tensions in the labour market, reflected in the reported recruitment problems, as well as the continued wage demands of various occupational groups.",
        "Some Council members emphasised that despite this, the labour market had not generated significant inflationary pressure so far.",
        "Other Council members expressed the opinion that in the future the situation in the labour market might begin to translate more strongly into inflationary pressure and, as a result, lead to higher price growth than currently predicted.",
        "Turning to inflation developments in Poland, it was underlined that notwithstanding an increase in the recent period, annual consumer price growth remained low.",
        "Likewise, inflation net of food and energy prices is still low, despite some rise in recent months.",
        "Some Council members judged that taking into account the current forecasts, inflation in 2019 might remain close to the lower limit for deviations from the inflation target.",
        "Certain Council members pointed out that there had been a revision of the weights of individual expenditures in the CPI index.",
        "The revision of the weights reflected changes in the consumption structure of households, indicating an increase in the share of expenditures on higher-order goods.",
        "Other Council members, in turn, drew attention to the increase in growth of prices of services and industrial producer prices in the recent period, which might indicate growing domestic inflationary pressure.",
        "Certain Council members pointed to developments in electricity prices in the coming years as to an uncertainty factor.",
        "When analysing changes in inflation expectations, it was noted that in the recent period expectations of enterprises had declined, while households’ expectations had increased slightly.",
        "Certain Council members underlined that the decline in expectations of enterprises was the result of the freezing of electricity prices.",
        "Other Council members pointed out that long-term inflation expectations of market participants remained anchored close to the inflation target.",
        "While discussing monetary policy, the Council decided that interest rates should remain unchanged.",
        "In the Council’s assessment, the outlook for economic conditions in Poland remains favourable, although the coming quarters may see a gradual slowdown in GDP growth.",
        "At the same time, inflation will continue at a moderate level and will remain close to the target in the monetary policy transmission horizon.",
        "Thus, the Council judged that the current level of interest rates was conducive to keeping the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic stability.",
        "The majority of the Council members expressed the opinion that, taking into account current information, interest rates were also likely to remain stable in the coming quarters.",
        "These Council members pointed out that their assessment was supported by current forecasts indicating a limited risk of a lasting deviation of price growth from the inflation target.",
        "They emphasised that another argument in favour of keeping interest rates stable was the heightened uncertainty about the scale and duration of the slowdown in the global economy, along with its feeding through to domestic economic conditions.",
        "Some Council members stressed that there were factors which, in the medium term, could push inflation to higher levels than suggested by the current forecasts.",
        "They remarked that should the announced fiscal measures, a potential pick-up in wage growth, or a possible increase in energy prices result in a marked rise in inflation that would jeopardise meeting the inflation target in the medium term, it might be justified to consider an increase in the NBP interest rates in the coming quarters.",
        "A view was also expressed that in the hypothetical event of a slump in economic activity accompanied by a marked deterioration in consumer and corporate sentiment, in the longer run it might be justified to consider a decrease in interest rates or the introduction of unconventional monetary policy instruments.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 1.50%, the lombard rate at 2.50%, the deposit rate at 0.50%, the rediscount rate at 1.75%.",
        "During the meeting, the Council pointed out that activity growth in the world economy remained relatively soft, and the global economic outlook continued to deteriorate.",
        "It was observed that global activity growth was dragged down by the continued downturn in the industrial sector.",
        "It was emphasized that while conditions in the service sector remained relatively strong, incoming data pointed to a likely slowdown in activity in this sector over the coming months.",
        "The Council members observed that activity growth in the euro area remained low, and GDP growth in 2019 Q3 was probably weaker than in the previous quarter.",
        "Incoming information signalled a deepening of the downturn in the industrial sector of the euro area, which was beginning to have an adverse effect on the previously relatively high activity in the service sector.",
        "It was stated that economic conditions in Germany continued to be weak, and the outlook for that economy had worsened.",
        "Some Council members judged that the German economy had probably entered recession in 2019 Q3.",
        "Incoming data showed that the deteriorating situation in German industry was accompanied by softer activity in the service sector and slower employment growth.",
        "Some Council members were of the opinion that those developments increased the risk that consumer demand, which had been the main driver of economic growth in Germany up to that point, would weaken in the subsequent quarters.",
        "In the United States, while business climate continues to be favourable, the economy is in a slowdown.",
        "Business confidence indicators for both industry and services signal that economic activity growth in 2019 Q3 had softened.",
        "Some Council members expressed the opinion that weaker growth in these sectors would have a dampening effect on corporate investment activity in the quarters to come.",
        "It was observed that against the background of shrinking exports, growth in the US economy would continue to be driven by rising consumption.",
        "It was pointed out that that the recent decline in household confidence posed a risk factor to consumer demand growth.",
        "Should consumption weaken, GDP growth in the United States might, according to some Council members, slow in the coming quarters by more than forecast.",
        "Certain Council members pointed to a range of indicators signalling a growing risk of recession in the United States.",
        "The Council members highlighted the fact that the growth outlook for the major emerging market economies was also deteriorating.",
        "It was noted that in China, following the likely slowdown in 2019 Q3, GDP growth was expected to decelerate further.",
        "Growth forecasts for India had recently been revised markedly downwards.",
        "In turn, GDP growth in Russia – notwithstanding the expected slight pick-up – would probably remain weak.",
        "In the global commodity markets, oil prices increased in September while remaining lower than a year ago.",
        "It was highlighted that following their temporary spike, related to the attack on an oil refinery in Saudi Arabia, oil prices fell.",
        "Certain Council members judged that the fall in oil prices was due to supply-side factors.",
        "Other Council members expressed the view that the decline in oil prices was also driven by the negative outlook for demand for oil as a result of the slowing pace of global economic growth.",
        "It was emphasised that lower oil prices than a year ago dragged on price growth in many economies, including the euro area.",
        "The Council members observed that many central banks had recently eased their monetary policy.",
        "In particular, in September, the European Central Bank had loosened its monetary policy by decreasing the deposit rate further below zero, announcing the resumption of its asset purchase programme and relaxing the terms of long-term refinancing operations.",
        "At the same time, the ECB had signalled the likely maintenance of interest rates at the present level or below in the subsequent quarters.",
        "Likewise, the Federal Reserve of the United States had eased the monetary policy by cutting interest rates again.",
        "Some Council members observed that market expectations pointed to further monetary policy easing in the United States in the quarters to come.",
        "The Council members judged that economic conditions in Poland remained favourable, even though incoming data pointed to a weakening in economic growth in 2019 Q3.",
        "It was observed that the main factor behind softer activity growth was the deterioration in economic conditions abroad.",
        "It is reflected in the slowing export growth and a decline – seen in August 2019 – in industrial output.",
        "It was pointed out that, at the same time, GDP growth was being stabilised by rising consumption, supported by increasing employment and wages, very strong consumer sentiment and the disbursement of social benefits.",
        "Investment in the economy was also judged to be rising, albeit probably at a slower pace than in the first half of 2019, as indicated by a slowdown in output growth in construction and assembly in recent months.",
        "In the Council’s assessment, GDP growth in the coming years would continue at a relatively high level, despite the expected slowdown.",
        "It was noted that economic growth would still be driven by consumption demand growth, supported by the sustained rise in household disposable income due to favourable labour market conditions combined with the increase in the minimum wage in 2020, as well as the disbursement of social benefits and the tax cuts.",
        "At the same time, some Council members judged that owing to the deteriorating outlook for global economic conditions and the signs of its feeding through to activity in Polish industry, the pace of growth in the subsequent quarters might be slower than envisaged in the July projection.",
        "In contrast, certain Council members expressed the opinion that GDP growth might prove slightly higher than forecast.",
        "They judged that the diminished demand for Polish products from key trading partners could be substituted by increased sales to other foreign markets and to the domestic market.",
        "Certain Council members were of the opinion that investment growth might also exceed the forecast due to the positive influence of public investment projects on enterprises’ investment decisions.",
        "At the same time, the Council members highlighted the fact that uncertainty about the scale and duration of the slowdown abroad and about its impact on domestic economic activity had increased again recently.",
        "Incoming data on employment and wages confirm the continued good labour market performance.",
        "Some Council members were of the view that demand for labour was probably weakening, as indicated by the slowing growth in employment in the enterprise sector and data on the number of newly created positions and job offers.",
        "At the same time, the unemployment rate remains very low.",
        "It was stressed that this was accompanied by stable wage growth in the enterprise sector.",
        "It was pointed out that in September – according to the GUS flash estimate – inflation stood at 2.6% y/y.",
        "It was highlighted that despite the decline in month-on-month growth in food prices, their annual growth remained high and posed a major factor driving the inflation up.",
        "Alongside that, lower than a year ago energy prices, including fuel prices, had a curbing effect on price growth.",
        "At the same time, core inflation remained moderate, which – in the opinion of some Council members – was consistent with the present business cycle position of the Polish economy.",
        "Certain Council members judged that the pick-up in the prices of services and goods sensitive to domestic economic conditions might be a sign of mounting demand pressure.",
        "It was also emphasised that producer price growth remained low.",
        "According to current forecasts, inflation might rise slightly in the coming months, and in 2020 Q1 price growth might temporarily accelerate and run close to the upper limit of deviations from the inflation target.",
        "Some Council members noted that the inflation growth forecast at the beginning of 2020 would largely result from the statistical base effect and the assumed increase in energy prices.",
        "These Council members underlined that – according to current forecasts – in the successive months of 2020 inflation would decline and run close to 2.5% within a year.",
        "The majority of the Council members judged that a factor of uncertainty regarding the possible rise in inflation at the beginning of 2020 was the regulatory changes in the electricity market, which were difficult to predict.",
        "Some Council members expressed the opinion that in the case of a further deterioration in global economic conditions and its stronger impact on the domestic economic situation, price growth in the subsequent quarters of 2020 might decline more sharply than forecast.",
        "However, certain Council members were of the opinion that the negative impact of the downturn abroad on inflation in Poland might be limited when accompanied by increased domestic sales.",
        "These Council members also pointed out that the relatively high wage growth, exceeding that of labour productivity, might boost price growth.",
        "Certain Council members underlined that a factor of uncertainty for the inflation outlook was the development of global oil prices.",
        "Certain Council members noted that in the recent period growth in consumer loans and money supply remained high, exceeding the growth rate of nominal GDP.",
        "However, other Council members judged that total growth of loans to the non-financial sector was currently not excessive.",
        "While discussing monetary policy, the majority of the Council members decided that interest rates should remain unchanged.",
        "In the opinion of these Council members, the outlook for economic conditions in Poland remains favourable, and GDP growth will continue at a relatively high rate in the coming years, although it will gradually decline.",
        "However, uncertainty about the scale and persistence of the slowdown abroad as well as its impact on domestic economic activity had increased.",
        "At the same time, after a temporary rise in 2020 Q1, inflation will remain close to the target in the monetary policy transmission horizon.",
        "Thus, the majority of the Council members judged that the current level of interest rates was conducive to keeping the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic stability.",
        "The majority of the Council members expressed the opinion that, taking into account current information, interest rates were likely to remain stable also in the coming quarters.",
        "These Council members pointed out that their assessment was supported by current forecasts indicating a limited risk of a lasting deviation of price growth from the inflation target, amid the forecast gradual slowdown in economic growth.",
        "Certain Council members pointed to factors that might boost inflation higher than indicated by the current forecasts.",
        "They noted that should there be a significant rise in inflation that would jeopardise meeting the inflation target in the medium term, it might be justified to consider an increase in the NBP interest rates in the coming quarters.",
        "However, in the opinion of these Council members, uncertainty about economic outlook and future price growth had risen, while the likelihood of such a scenario had declined.",
        "Certain Council members noted that in recent months there were more signs of a deterioration in global economic conditions.",
        "In the opinion of these Council members, these factors could also have a negative impact on economic growth in Poland.",
        "At the same time, the risk of a lasting deviation of inflation from the NBP target was limited.",
        "As a result, a view was expressed that it was justified to lower interest rates at the current meeting.",
        "The view was also upheld that in the longer run it might be justified to consider a further decrease in interest rates or the introduction of unconventional monetary policy instruments.",
        "At the meeting a motion to cut the NBP interest rates by 0.25 percentage points was submitted.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 1.50%, the lombard rate at 2.50%, the deposit rate at 0.50%, the rediscount rate at 1.75%.",
        "During the meeting, the Council pointed out that activity growth in the world economy remained soft and uncertainty about the global economic outlook persisted.",
        "Recessionary trends continue in industry in the major economies and annual growth in global trade is negative.",
        "Reflecting these developments, forecasts of international financial institutions indicate continued sluggish GDP growth worldwide in 2020.",
        "It was emphasised that in the euro area economic growth remained low in 2019 Q3.",
        "It was noted that industrial output in the euro area was declining and business confidence indicators for the industrial sector – despite some improvement seen in November – still did not signal a recovery.",
        "It was judged that economic activity in the euro area was supported by a steady rise in consumption, driven by positive household sentiment and favourable labour market conditions.",
        "However, certain Council members pointed to the gradually deteriorating sentiment in services and slower annual growth in employment, which both may pose a risk for economic conditions in the euro area.",
        "In Germany, GDP growth in 2019 Q3 was positive and higher than expected, albeit still very low.",
        "It was also emphasised that in the United States, the GDP data for 2019 Q3 corroborated the persistently robust economic conditions as compared to other advanced economies, yet annual GDP growth was gradually decreasing.",
        "It was pointed out that amid weak global economic growth, inflation in many countries was moderate, and in the euro area it was low.",
        "In November, oil prices in the global commodity markets were relatively stable, although subject to temporary fluctuations driven by both supply and demand factors.",
        "The European Central Bank is keeping the deposit rate below zero, while conducting asset purchases and signalling the maintenance of loose monetary policy in the coming quarters.",
        "The US Federal Reserve, after the interest rate cuts of recent months, was keeping the rates unchanged.",
        "In Poland, economic conditions remain good, despite slower economic growth in 2019 Q3.",
        "GDP growth is supported by stable consumption growth, fuelled by favourable labour market conditions, very strong consumer confidence and disbursement of social benefits.",
        "Investment continued to rise in 2019 Q3, although at a slower pace, which was most likely due to the fall in local government investment and the slower growth in investment cofinanced by EU funds.",
        "At the same time, it was underlined that exports growth increased in 2019 Q3, albeit it was lower than in the previous years.",
        "Some Council members pointed out that the incoming monthly data were signalling the likelihood of a slight slowdown in GDP growth in 2019 Q4.",
        "In October 2019, growth in industrial output was lower than in the first half of 2019, while assembly and construction output declined in year-on-year terms.",
        "Certain Council members also stressed that household sentiment remained upbeat, although it had deteriorated slightly in the recent period, and the PMI in industry continued at below 50 points.",
        "The Council members indicated that wage growth in the economy had picked up somewhat in 2019 Q3 on the back of the rising wages in the public sector.",
        "Attention was also drawn to the persistently low unemployment rate.",
        "However, certain Council members emphasised that demand for labour might stabilise.",
        "This was suggested by the weaker wage growth and a further slight decrease in employment in month-on-month terms in the corporate sector as well as the lower number of job offers in the recent period.",
        "The majority of the Council members were of the opinion that the outlook for domestic economic conditions remained favourable, and GDP growth – despite the expected slowdown – would continue at a relatively high level in the coming quarters.",
        "It was argued that the continuation of sluggish growth abroad and the possible decline in investment growth might contain GDP growth, while the continuing rise in consumer demand would have a stabilising impact on economic conditions.",
        "It was pointed out that annual inflation stood at 2.6% y/y in November 2019.",
        "It was driven up by elevated food price growth, while being curbed by lower energy prices than a year ago, including fuel prices.",
        "Some Council members noted that inflation in month-on-month terms was lower than in the first half of 2019.",
        "The majority of the Council members judged that although core inflation had risen somewhat in recent months, it remained moderate.",
        "These Council members underlined that growth of non-food goods prices stayed very low, while core inflation was propelled by faster growth in services prices, partly driven by increases in certain administered charges, and partly by rising wages that reflected convergence of the Polish economy.",
        "Consequently, the majority of the Council members assessed price pressures in the economy to be moderate.",
        "At the same time, it was observed that the retail sales deflator was low, and producer price growth had declined slightly below zero in the recent period.",
        "Certain Council members were of the opinion that one of the factors behind the faster growth in services prices than in previous years was the persisting demand pressure in the economy.",
        "The majority of the Council members anticipated that CPI inflation would rise temporarily in 2020 Q1, before declining and running close to the inflation target in the subsequent quarters.",
        "It was emphasised that over the projection horizon inflation would be contained by weaker economic growth in Poland and the likely persistence of low inflation abroad.",
        "The majority of the Council members emphasised that the forecast temporary rise in inflation in 2020 Q1 would stem from factors beyond the reach of domestic monetary policy, including statistical base effects.",
        "Moreover, it was judged that uncertainty about energy price growth in the coming quarters continued.",
        "Certain Council members were of the opinion that inflation in the subsequent quarters might remain higher than 2.5%.",
        "They underlined that price growth might be boosted by further growth in services prices, including prices of administered services.",
        "They also pointed out the potential upward pressure on inflation stemming from the growth in monetary aggregates, related to the rapid – in their opinion – expansion in consumer and housing loans to households.",
        "In this context, these Council members additionally observed that the NBP reference rate was negative in real terms, and that the rise in inflation in 2020 Q1, should it materialise, would bring it down.",
        "In turn, the majority of the Council members indicated that central bank interest rates were currently negative in real terms in many economies, including, in particular, in the euro area.",
        "They also pointed out that the real interest rates on lending to households and enterprises were well into positive territory.",
        "These Council members underlined that total credit growth in the economy was stable and remained lower than nominal GDP growth, while corporate lending growth was slowing down.",
        "The majority of the Council members decided that interest rates should remain unchanged.",
        "In their opinion, the outlook for the domestic economy remained favourable and GDP growth, despite the expected decline, would continue at a relatively high level in the coming quarters.",
        "At the same time, the Council assessed that uncertainty as to the scale and duration of the economic slowdown abroad and its impact on domestic economic activity persisted.",
        "In the opinion of the majority of the Council members, after a temporary rise in 2020 Q1, inflation would stay close to the target over the monetary policy transmission horizon.",
        "Consequently, the majority of the Council members judged that the current level of interest rates was conducive to keeping the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic stability.",
        "The majority of the Council members also expressed an opinion that, taking into account current information, interest rates were likely to remain stable in the coming quarters.",
        "These Council members pointed out that their assessment was supported by current forecasts indicating that inflation would remain in line with the NBP inflation target over the monetary policy horizon amid the forecast gradual slowing in GDP growth.",
        "Certain Council members emphasised that there were factors that might boost inflation higher than indicated by the current forecasts.",
        "They noted that should there be a significant rise in inflation and inflation expectations that would jeopardize meeting the inflation target in the medium term, it might be justified to consider an increase in interest rates in the coming quarters.",
        "In turn, certain Council members pointed out that signs of a deterioration in global economic conditions persisted.",
        "In the opinion of these Council members, the above factors could also have a negative impact on economic growth in Poland in the quarters to come.",
        "At the same time, the risk of a lasting deviation of inflation from the NBP target was limited.",
        "As a result, a view was expressed that it was justified to lower interest rates at the current meeting and that – in the longer run – it might be justified to consider a further decrease in interest rates or the introduction of unconventional monetary policy instruments.",
        "At the meeting a motion to cut the NBP interest rates by 0.25 percentage points was submitted.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 1.50%, the lombard rate at 2.50%, the deposit rate at 0.50% and the rediscount rate at 1.75%.",
        "During the meeting, the Council pointed out that activity growth in the world economy remained relatively soft and uncertainty about the global economic outlook persisted.",
        "It was underlined that industrial output was declining in year-on-year terms in almost all major world economies and global growth forecasts were lowered.",
        "As a result, in line with some projections, global GDP growth in 2019 might hit the lowest level for 10 years, and in 2020 might remain low, especially in the advanced economies.",
        "In the euro area, annual GDP growth in 2019 Q3 continued at a low level.",
        "It was pointed out that the downturn in industry was negatively affecting GDP growth in this economy.",
        "Against this background, it was highlighted that the euro area manufacturing PMI indicated the continuation of recessionary trends, although recently the index ceased to deteriorate.",
        "At the same time it was emphasised that business conditions in services in the euro area remained favourable, yet some Council members were of the opinion that the new orders index in this sector had declined considerably, which might signal a deterioration in business conditions in services in the coming quarters.",
        "It was pointed out that in Germany GDP growth in quarter-on-quarter terms probably remained low in 2019 Q3.",
        "It was stressed that industrial output in the German economy had been on a downward trend for several months, and the incoming data on business conditions suggested continuing negative trends in industry.",
        "It was underlined that the GDP growth forecasts for the German economy foresaw low economic growth also in 2020.",
        "Certain Council members indicated that economic conditions in France remained more favourable than in Germany.",
        "The Council members judged that in the United States economic conditions stayed relatively favourable, yet GDP growth declined in 2019 Q3.",
        "It was emphasised that activity growth in this economy continued to be driven by consumption, supported by robust rise in wages and low unemployment, while annual growth in investment and exports were close to zero in 2019 Q3.",
        "Inflation in many economies worldwide had decreased in recent months and remained moderate.",
        "In this regard, attention was drawn to a decline in inflation in the euro area, including in the euro area’s major economies, significantly below the level consistent with the price stability definition of the European Central Bank.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that inflation was higher in the faster growing Central and Eastern European euro area economies.",
        "The Council members drew attention to the fact that crude oil prices worldwide remained at a moderate level, which was one of the factors supporting low inflation.",
        "Certain Council members also expressed an opinion that crude oil prices might remain moderate in the coming quarters on account of low global growth and the expected increase in oil production.",
        "The Council members noted that many central banks have eased their monetary policies in the recent period.",
        "It was indicated that in October 2019, the Federal Reserve had cut its interest rates for the third time this year, while announcing it might leave interest rates unchanged in the coming months.",
        "Yet some Council members remarked that in line with the current market expectations, the Federal Reserve might take a decision on further interest rate cuts, although not in the months to come.",
        "It was emphasised that the European Central Bank, following the monetary policy easing in September 2019, had not changed the parameters of its monetary policy in October 2019.",
        "It was also indicated that financial markets expected further deposit rate cuts by the ECB in the future and anticipated the deposit rate to remain negative for the next several years.",
        "The Council members noted that economic conditions remained good in Poland, although the incoming data pointed to a possible slowing in growth in 2019 Q3, mainly due to the economic downturn abroad.",
        "It was underlined that the decline in the annual GDP growth in 2019 Q3 was suggested by lower output growth in both industry as well as assembly and construction in this period.",
        "Attention was also paid to further investment growth in 2019 Q3, although it was probably lower than in previous quarters.",
        "Some Council members pointed out that the recent fall in the PMI suggested that the weakening in economic activity abroad led to a change in the assessment of economic conditions by some enterprises.",
        "Some Council members indicated that despite sluggish economic activity in the euro area, Polish exports continued to expand, which was supported by its higher geographic diversification.",
        "The Council members noted that further growth in consumer demand, related to very strong consumer sentiment, favourable labour market conditions and disbursement of social benefits, had a positive impact on economic conditions in Poland.",
        "Yet some Council members pointed out in this context that although the situation in the labour market remained very good, the annual growth rate of employment in the enterprise sector declined and wage growth remained stable.",
        "The Council members judged that the outlook for domestic economic conditions remained favourable and GDP growth – despite its expected decline – would continue at a relatively high level over the coming quarters.",
        "The majority of the Council members was of the opinion that GDP growth would probably run close to the level envisaged in the November projection.",
        "It was pointed out that the economic downturn abroad and the possible decline in investment growth might contain GDP growth, while the continuing rise in consumer demand would have a stabilising impact on economic conditions.",
        "Some Council members judged that the risk of GDP growth being lower than envisaged by the central path of the November projection persisted.",
        "It was pointed out that stronger than expected economic slowdown abroad might contribute to lower GDP growth in Poland.",
        "According to certain Council members, rising prices of services could be a risk factor for consumption growth in the quarters to come, as they were likely to negatively affect both consumer sentiment and the purchasing power of consumers’ income.",
        "The Council members pointed out that according to the flash estimate of Statistics Poland (GUS), inflation in October 2019 was running at 2.5% y/y.",
        "It was boosted by the elevated – albeit declining – growth of food prices, whereas falling energy prices were curbing CPI inflation.",
        "The majority of the Council members indicated that in the recent period core inflation had risen, yet it continued to be moderate.",
        "These Council members emphasised that growth in goods prices remained very low, while core inflation was propelled by rising services prices, partly driven by increases of certain administered charges, and partly by rising wages that reflected convergence of the Polish economy.",
        "Certain Council members also drew attention to the low deflator of retail sales and the very low growth rate of the PPI that had persisted for several months.",
        "Certain Council members indicated, however, that the higher growth of services prices was also the result of persisting demand pressure in the economy.",
        "Moreover, they noted that the value added deflator was currently higher than consumer price growth.",
        "The majority of the Council members pointed out that in line with the central path of the November projection, CPI inflation in 2020 Q1 would temporarily increase, then decline and run close to the inflation target in the subsequent quarters.",
        "It was underlined that in the years to come inflation would be contained by weaker economic growth in Poland and likely persistence of low inflation abroad.",
        "The majority of the Council members also indicated that uncertainty about energy prices in the coming quarters remained.",
        "Certain Council members assessed that due to the marked – in their opinion – demand pressure in the economy, the following quarters might continue to see inflation run higher than envisaged in the central projection path.",
        "In this context, they also attracted attention to the high – in their view – rise in household lending and growth in monetary aggregates exceeding that of nominal GDP.",
        "However, other Council members pointed out that corporate lending was low and continued to decline.",
        "The majority of the Council members decided that interest rates should remain unchanged.",
        "In their opinion, the outlook for the domestic economy remained favourable and GDP growth, despite the expected decline, would continue at a relatively high level in the coming quarters.",
        "At the same time, the Council assessed that uncertainty as to the scale and duration of the economic slowdown abroad and its impact on domestic economic activity persisted.",
        "In the opinion of the majority of the Council members, after a temporary rise in 2020 Q1, inflation would stay close to the target over the monetary policy transmission horizon.",
        "Consequently, the majority of the Council members judged that the current level of interest rates was conducive to keeping the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic stability.",
        "The majority of the Council members also expressed an opinion that, taking into account current information and the projection results, interest rates were likely to remain stable in the coming quarters.",
        "These Council members pointed out that their assessment was supported by current forecasts indicating that inflation would remain in line with the NBP inflation target over the monetary policy horizon amid the forecast gradual slowdown in GDP growth.",
        "Certain Council members emphasised that there were factors that might boost inflation higher than indicated by the current forecasts.",
        "They noted that should there be a significant rise in inflation and inflation expectations that would jeopardize meeting the inflation target in the medium term, it might be justified to consider an increase in interest rates in the coming quarters.",
        "In turn, certain Council members pointed out that in recent months there were more signs of a deterioration in global economic conditions.",
        "In the opinion of these Council members, the above factors could also have a negative impact on economic growth in Poland.",
        "At the same time, the risk of a lasting deviation of inflation from the NBP target was limited.",
        "As a result, a view was expressed that it was justified to lower interest rates at the current meeting.",
        "The view was also upheld that in the longer run it might be justified to consider a further decrease in interest rates or the introduction of unconventional monetary policy instruments.",
        "At the meeting a motion to cut the NBP interest rates by 0.25 percentage points was submitted.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 1.50%, the lombard rate at 2.50%, the deposit rate at 0.50% and the rediscount rate at 1.75%."

    "2021": [
        "During the discussion the Council members pointed out that in 2020 Q4 – as COVID 19 infections increased and sanitary restrictions were tightened again in some countries – the global recovery had slowed down.",
        "The pace of the global economic recovery had been negatively affected primarily by deteriorating situation in the services sector, while industrial activity had continued to grow.",
        "It was observed that despite weakened economic conditions, GDP growth in some economies had probably been positive in 2020 Q4.",
        "However, it was judged that the euro area economy had probably again plunged into recession in that period.",
        "It was pointed out that GDP growth in the euro area had been dragged down mainly by a downturn in the services sector.",
        "In turn, economic growth in the region had been boosted by relatively robust external demand, which had supported industrial activity in the euro area.",
        "The Council members observed that the epidemic situation in Europe remained difficult.",
        "In some countries, the number of new infections remained elevated, and a new rise in infections was observed in a number of economies.",
        "This was causing the authorities in many European countries to extend or tighten existing restrictions.",
        "Some Council members expressed the opinion that under the circumstances, despite the fact that vaccinations had started in many countries, uncertainty about the further course of the pandemic and its impact on global economic conditions had risen.",
        "Referring to the economic outlook in the euro area, the Council members judged that a possible resurgence in global COVID-19 infections might hurt not only the services sector, but also exports, and consequently have an adverse impact on the region’s GDP.",
        "That would reduce the chance that inflation in the euro area would rise from its current very low levels.",
        "It was indicated that under such circumstances the ECB and other major central banks – the Federal Reserve, Bank of Japan and Riksbank – had recently continued their monetary policy easing, primarily through increasing the scale of asset purchases or extending the announced duration of their operation.",
        "At the same time, those banks had continued to communicate that they would maintain interest rates at a very low level over the next few years.",
        "In view of the further easing of monetary policy by the major central banks and the improved sentiment in the international financial markets following the launch of COVID-19 vaccinations, the prices of some financial assets, including those of emerging economies, had risen.",
        "This was accompanied by an increase in the prices of some commodities in the global markets, including the prices of oil.",
        "When referring to the Polish economy, it was pointed out that the rise in COVID-19 infections and the tightening of the epidemic restrictions in 2020 Q4 had had a negative effect on economic activity.",
        "It was observed that there had been a marked slump in business conditions in the services sector, as indicated by a t fall in retail sales in October and November and the declining expenditure on services settled by payment cards.",
        "Certain Council members emphasised that although the slowdown in activity was registered only in some sectors, those sectors made a substantial contribution to GDP.",
        "At the same time, it was observed that the situation in the industrial sector remained favourable, as indicated by sustained industrial output growth.",
        "It was judged that the progressive increase in production showed that Polish companies had adapted their operations to the restrictions and requirements related to the pandemic.",
        "It was pointed out that output had risen particularly robustly in sections where a significant part of the products were exported.",
        "It was judged that rising exports were the main factor supporting economic activity in 2020 Q4.",
        "It was observed that current forecasts suggested that annual GDP growth in 2020 Q4 was still negative and probably lower than in the previous quarter.",
        "While discussing the situation in the labour market, it was pointed out that the November data suggested a stabilisation of average employment and the annual growth of average wage in the corporate sector.",
        "It was also observed that the registered unemployment rate remained stable.",
        "The Council members judged that current forecasts suggested a rebound in economic activity in 2021, although uncertainty about its scale and pace had increased.",
        "The main source of this uncertainty was the further development of the pandemic and its impact on the economic situation at home and abroad.",
        "It was observed that the economic policy measures taken so far, including the easing of NBP’s monetary policy, would have a positive impact on the economic situation.",
        "At the same time, the majority of the Council members believed that the economic recovery in 2021 would be gradual.",
        "It was stated that the heightened uncertainty and weaker sentiment of economic agents than before the pandemic would result in a substantial decline in investment.",
        "The majority of the Council members were of the opinion that, in view of the increased likelihood of a new surge in COVID-19 infections and an extension of the restrictions in Poland and abroad, there was a higher risk that GDP growth in the coming quarters would be weaker than previously expected.",
        "These members judged that under these conditions the financial situation of part of companies might deteriorate further, resulting in higher unemployment and slower wage growth.",
        "Furthermore, the majority of the Council members observed that in the case of a synchronised surge in the pandemic across many countries, external demand might decline, with a negative impact on domestic activity.",
        "The Council members pointed out that the development of zloty exchange rate against the major currencies would be a factor affecting domestic economic conditions and prices in 2021.",
        "It was observed that amid a negative shock, exchange rate adjustments were an important mechanism of shock absorption, as evidenced by Poland’s experience during the global financial crisis.",
        "The majority of the Council reiterated that the lack of a visible and more durable zloty exchange rate adjustment might reduce the pace of economic recovery.",
        "In this context it was highlighted that in 2020, despite the major shock related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the easing of NBP’ monetary policy, zloty real effective exchange rate had remained stable.",
        "The majority of the Council members also emphasised that the risk of a slower and weaker recovery in domestic activity and – as a result of an excessive slowdown in price growth - was boosted by pressure on the zloty to appreciate observed since the end of October 2020 and related to the further monetary policy easing by the major central banks.",
        "The majority of the Council members judged that the foreign exchange interventions conducted since December 2020 had curbed the risk of a procyclical strengthening of the zloty and amplified the impact of NBP’s monetary policy easing on the economy.",
        "Certain Council members were of the opinion that the positive effect of zloty depreciation on export activity might currently be smaller than in the past.",
        "They judged that the impact of zloty exchange rate movements on the financial performance of companies was limited by the significant import intensity of goods exports and the fact that many Polish companies operate as part of global value chains.",
        "When referring to inflation, the Council members pointed out that consumer price growth had declined significantly in December 2020 and was running close to 2.5%.",
        "It was observed that the decrease in inflation resulted partly from a marked decline in core inflation, and partly from the slower growth in the prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages.",
        "The majority of Council members assessed that inflation in 2021 would run at a level consistent with the NBP inflation target.",
        "These members emphasised that this year’s inflation would continue to be boosted by regulatory factors, which act as negative supply shocks, including a further rise in electricity prices for households and waste disposal charges.",
        "It was observed that since 2021 Q2 annual price growth would also be increased by base effects related to the waning of the impact of the 2020 decline in oil prices.",
        "Certain Council members judged that inflation in 2021 would be slightly higher than the current forecasts suggest.",
        "These members were of the opinion that inflation would be pushed up by the satisfaction of deferred consumer demand and – following an improvement in sales prospects – the adjustment of prices of goods and services to the earlier rise in production costs.",
        "The Council members observed that the deposits of both households and non financial companies had risen sharply in 2020.",
        "They judged that the rise in funds deposited in banks despite an economic slump had been caused by the continued heightened uncertainty about the future economic situation, discouraging consumer and investment spending.",
        "Moreover, the increase in corporate deposits had resulted from the fact that many companies had received considerable state aid funds.",
        "The majority of the Council members expressed the opinion that in such conditions the demand for credit – especially working capital credit – from enterprises was strongly limited.",
        "While discussing monetary policy, the Council members were of the opinion that the present meeting should keep interest rates unchanged and continue to pursue NBP’s remaining measures.",
        "The majority of the Council members judged that if economic recovery progressed in 2021 and price growth was in line with the inflation target, it would also be advisable to keep interest rates unchanged in the subsequent quarters.",
        "At the same time, in the opinion of these Council members, if the economic conditions and outlook were to deteriorate significantly, e.g.",
        "due to a new surge in the pandemic, further monetary policy easing might be justified, including by a reduction in the interest rate.",
        "Certain Council members believed that, should further easing of monetary conditions be necessary, a further cut in NBP interest rates would not be advisable and instead the additional measures aimed at supporting corporate lending should be implemented.",
        "It was observed that NBP’s monetary policy mitigated the negative economic impact of the pandemic, supported economic activity and stabilised inflation at the level consistent with NBP’s medium-term inflation target.",
        "Due to its positive impact on the financial situation of debtors, it was also conducive to the strengthening of financial system stability.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 0.10%, the lombard rate at 0.50%, the deposit rate at 0.00%, the rediscount rate at 0.11%, and the discount rate at 0.12%.",
        "At the Council meeting it was pointed out that June had seen a reduction in the scale of the pandemic globally and the number of new infections was less than half the spring figure.",
        "As a result, the sanitary restrictions were being gradually eased in many countries.",
        "At the same time, it was observed that the spread of new mutations of the virus had caused increased uncertainty about the further course of the pandemic.",
        "This uncertainty was boosted by the still relatively low vaccination rate in many countries and the lower effectiveness of vaccinations against the new variants of the virus.",
        "It was pointed out that in some countries – even those with a high number of vaccinated people – the number of infections with the new variant of the virus was increasing, which was contributing to the reintroduction of certain restrictions.",
        "The gradual easing of sanitary restrictions in many economies supported a marked rebound of global economic activity following the earlier deep recession.",
        "It was pointed out that the improvement in business conditions in services in many countries was accompanied by further growth in industrial sector activity alongside the occurrence of supply restrictions in certain markets.",
        "It was observed that in the euro area 2021 Q2 had brought an increase in industrial activity and also a rebound in turnover in trade and services after a fall in GDP in 2021 Q1.",
        "The majority of the Council members underlined that the high growth in industrial and construction and assembly output, as well as in retail sales in this economy, was to a large extent the result of the low base effect.",
        "They drew attention to the fact that economic activity in the euro area remained lower than before the pandemic and that the available forecasts suggested that a full recovery in GDP would not take place until 2022.",
        "The opinion was expressed that it would not be possible to declare the negative effects of the pandemic completely eliminated until the macroeconomic indicators had returned permanently to the level determined by the pre-pandemic trend.",
        "When referring to the global economic outlook, it was judged that the further devel opment of the pandemic represented a risk factor for the sustainability of the currently observed recovery in global economic activity.",
        "It was pointed out that although successive waves of the pandemic had had a smaller impact on the economic situation, any new increase in the number of infections could slow down the economic recovery, particularly if the new wave was accompanied by a deterioration in consumer and business sentiment.",
        "It was judged that the global recovery was contributing to an increase in commodity prices in the global markets, including oil prices, which were significantly higher than a year earlier.",
        "Certain Council members expressed the opinion that in view of the expected further increase in demand for oil, the price of this commodity would most likely continue to rise.",
        "However, the majority of the Council members were of the opinion that even in the face of growing demand, growth in oil prices should slow down.",
        "High commodity prices alongside with rising costs of international transport and the price effects of constraints in the supply of certain intermediate goods would boost inflation in the global economy, including in the developed economies.",
        "Some Council members underlined that global inflation had risen by approximately 2 percentage points between January and May, to reach its highest level in a decade.",
        "These Council members observed that inflation in the United States had also risen sharply since the beginning of the year.",
        "During the discussion it was pointed out that despite the significant increase in infla tion, the major central banks were keeping interest rates low, conducting asset purchases as well as signalling that loose monetary policy would be maintained in the future.",
        "It was also observed that such measures were justified by the temporary character of the factors currently boosting inflation, and the persistence of uncertainty about the future economic outlook.",
        "It was pointed out that the majority of financial market participants also judged the higher level of price growth to be temporary, as evidenced by the decline in long-term inflation expectations and bond yields in the largest developed economies.",
        "Certain Council members drew attention to the fact that at its June meeting the Federal Reserve of the United States had raised its interest rate on excess reserve balances by 0.05 percentage points to 0.15% in order to increase the effectiveness of the monetary policy implementation.",
        "At the same time, the majority of the Council members underlined that this decision was of a technical nature.",
        "They also observed that it did not represent a change in the monetary policy stance.",
        "Certain Council members pointed out that in response to heightened inflation, some central banks in the region of Central and Eastern Europe, i.e.",
        "the central banks of the Czech Republic and Hungary, had recently raised interest rates.",
        "However, the majority of the Council members pointed out that such decisions were partly dictated by factors specific to these economies and a different assessment of the economic outlook and course of future price developments.",
        "When assessing the situation in Poland, the Council members pointed out that recent months had seen a marked recovery in economic activity.",
        "Retail sales had risen significantly in May, accompanied by a slight rise in construction and assembly output and the continued good situation in industry.",
        "Certain Council members expressed the opinion that these data, along with the good export performance, indicated a very favourable situation in the Polish economy.",
        "However, the majority of the Council members noted that the high levels of annual economic indicators were the combined effect of three factors – the rebound in economic activity following the easing of the sanitary restrictions, the realisation of pent-up demand, and the effect of a low base a year ago – and should be interpreted with caution.",
        "These Council members underlined that while industrial output had already exceeded its pre-pandemic level, construction and assembly output remained significantly lower.",
        "While analysing the labour market situation, the Council members underlined that it remained good.",
        "They pointed out that in May, along with the easing of the restrictions, average employment in the enterprise sector had increased.",
        "It was judged that the smaller use of care and sickness benefits, the return of working hours to pre-pandemic levels, and also the rising number of employees hired in the sectors most affected by the pandemic restrictions contributed to this growth in employment.",
        "Certain Council members pointed out that growth in demand for labour was accompanied by wage pressure reflected in relatively high wage growth in the enterprise sector.",
        "In turn, the majority of the Council members expressed the opinion that the labour market situation was not generating excessive wage pressure, and that wage growth in the enterprise sector – after adjustment for the low base effect – remained lower than before the pandemic.",
        "Moreover, these Council members observed that wage growth did not exceed labour productivity growth and as a result annual growth in unit labour costs in industry was negative.",
        "The Council members underlined that NBP’s July projection indicated a very favour able domestic economic outlook.",
        "The majority of the Council members were of the opinion that the economic developments in the coming quarters were subject to considerable uncertainty, primarily related to the future course of the pandemic.",
        "These Council members observed that it could not be ruled out that a possible new increase in the number of infections and the consequent reintroduction of restrictions would translate into a weakening of economic growth.",
        "The majority of the Council members also pointed out that the positive impact of pent-up demand on consumption observed so far might be short-lived and that growth in consumer spending might slow down later in the year.",
        "These Council members also underlined that in a situation in which the rebound in economic activity was weakening, the labour market situation might begin to deteriorate, particularly in view of the termination of assistance from the anti-crisis shields.",
        "In turn, certain Council members judged that continued high GDP growth which was forecast for the coming quarters was highly likely, taking into account the very good situation in industry, the rapid growth in exports, and the significant household savings.",
        "These Council members expressed the opinion that in view of the significant number of people vaccinated and the progressive adaptation of economic entities to operating amid a pandemic, any further waves of infections would not represent a significant risk factor for rapid economic growth.",
        "At the Council meeting it was pointed out that according to the GUS preliminary data, June saw a fall in annual CPI to 4.4% (in monthly terms CPI stood at 0.1%).",
        "At the same time, according to preliminary estimates, core inflation excluding food and energy prices declined to its lowest level for over a year.",
        "The majority of Council members underlined that the annual CPI inflation rate continued to be boosted by rapid growth in fuel prices – due to significantly higher global oil prices than a year earlier – the increase in electricity prices, which took place at the beginning of 2021, and the increase in waste disposal charges, and thus by factors which were beyond the control of domestic monetary policy.",
        "They observed that inflation was also driven up by the higher costs of running a business amidst the pandemic, higher international transport charges and temporary disruptions in global supply chains.",
        "In this context, these Council members drew attention to the fact that according to the full data for May, the increase in fuel prices and of in administered prices accounted for over half of the CPI inflation rate.",
        "As a result, the majority of the Council members judged that demand factors were not causing excessive price growth and not causing inflation to exceed the inflation target.",
        "In turn, certain Council members drew attention to the fact that demand factors ac counted for almost half of the observed growth in the prices of consumer goods.",
        "Moreover, they underlined that the persistence of elevated inflation might lead to an increase in inflation expectations.",
        "The majority of the Council members observed that balance statistics describing consumers’ inflation expectations had recently shifted towards lower price growth.",
        "The majority of the Council members judged that as a result of factors beyond the influence of domestic monetary policy, annual inflation in the coming months was likely to remain above the upper limit of deviations from the inflation target.",
        "These Council members were of the opinion that, as indicated by NBP’s July projection, in 2022, following the fading of the factors temporarily boosting price growth, inflation would decline.",
        "t the same time, these Council members pointed out that the scale of the decline in inflation would depend on the development of the future economic situation, while even amid a very positive economic scenario as outlined in the projection, inflation would return to the band of deviations from the inflation target.",
        "The majority of the Council members drew attention to the fact that in accordance with the projection, over the whole of its horizon price growth would remain significantly lower than wage growth, including growth in the minimum wage, which would translate into a marked improvement in the financial situation of households and would limit the build-up of wage pressure.",
        "Certain Council members underlined that the July projection pointed to a higher in flation path in 2022 than the previous projection and showed only a temporary decline in price growth in 2022 and another increase in 2023.",
        "These Council members were of the opinion that with the continued favourable economic situation and in view of the gradual realisation of pent-up demand, in the coming quarters demand pressure would build up.",
        "In the opinion of these Council members, this might lead to inflation running at an elevated level in 2022 as well.",
        "The majority of the Council members were of the opinion that lending growth was not contributing to inflation rising above NBP’s inflation target.",
        "It was also observed that the rate of growth in deposits of the non-financial sector remained higher than the growth of liabilities of this sector.",
        "The majority of Council members were of the opinion that the present meeting should keep interest rates unchanged and continue to pursue NBP’s remaining measures.",
        "These Council members judged that the monetary policy conducted by NBP supported the consolidation of economic recovery following the pandemic-induced recession and stabilised inflation at the level consistent with NBP’s inflation target in the medium term.",
        "They drew attention to the fact that keeping NBP interest rates unchanged was currently justified due to the sources and the expected temporary nature of inflation exceeding NBP’s target, as well as the uncertainty about the robustness and scale of the economic recovery.",
        "The majority of Council members judged that if the uncertainty about the further course of the pandemic, and – as a result – the future economic conditions continued, and if the rise in inflation above the target was the result of factors beyond the control of monetary policy, it would be advisable to keep interest rates unchanged also in the near future.",
        "In their opinion, the tightening of monetary conditions in response to inflation running above the inflation target due to negative supply shocks and regulatory factors would not curb price growth in 2021, while it could halt economic recovery following a considerable economic downturn caused by the pandemic.",
        "Some Council members judged that if, after the uncertainty about the pandemic situ ation and the economic outlook had subsided, robust economic growth continued and inflation, driven by demand factors, exceeded NBP’s inflation target, it might be advisable to adjust monetary policy.",
        "Certain Council members were of the opinion that the NBP reference rate should be raised at the current meeting.",
        "They drew attention to the fact that price growth was currently elevated and that demand factors were also boosting prices.",
        "They also judged that heightened inflation expectations and wage pressure might lead to the consolidation of inflation above NBP’s target.",
        "They underlined that according to July projection inflation would stay above 2,5% over the whole forecast horizon and in some quarters would exceed to upper limit of deviations from the target.",
        "In the opinion of these Council members, an increase in the reference rate could reduce such a risk and support the development of inflation at a level consistent with NBP’s inflation target.",
        "The Council rejected the motion to raise the reference rate by 15 basis points.",
        "The Council rejected the motion to increase the required reserve ratio to 3.5% and the motion to lower the interest rate on required reserves from the level of the NBP reference rate (currently 0.1%) to 0.01%.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 0.10%, the lombard rate at 0.50%, the deposit rate at 0.00%, the rediscount rate at 0.11%, and the discount rate at 0.12%.",
        "During the discussion the Council members pointed out that the surge of the pandemic and the related restrictions had had a negative impact on global economic activity in 2020 Q4 and at the beginning of 2021.",
        "Attention was drawn to the fact that the euro area had slipped into recession again in 2020 Q4.",
        "It was observed that available data on the economic situation at the beginning of 2021 pointed to a continued downturn in the services sector, with a further rise in industrial output.",
        "At the same time it was underlined that the negative impact of weakened activity in services on the overall economic situation was so significant that 2021 Q1 would most likely see a fall in GDP in quarterly terms.",
        "Moreover, the majority of the Council members underlined that even under the assumption of an improvement in the pandemic situation in the second half of the current year, the forecasts indicated only a moderate economic growth in the euro area for the whole of 2021.",
        "The Council members pointed out that despite slight rise in some countries in January, inflation in the global economy was low.",
        "The majority of the Council members emphasised that in January and February inflation in the euro area had increased, but the rise had taken place after half a year of deflation, and the increase in price growth was largely the result of regulatory factors, including the hike in the VAT rates in Germany (after their temporary lowering in the second half of 2020).",
        "Inflation had also been boosted by the rise in commodity prices in the global markets in recent months, including in particular the rise in oil prices.",
        "Certain Council members judged that the rising prices of this commodity reflected an optimistic assessment of the outlook for global demand by investors, supported by the progress of the COVID-19 vaccination programmes and the highly expansionary economic policy in many countries.",
        "They pointed out that oil prices would also be boosted by the implementation of the policy of limiting oil production by the countries associated in OPEC+ and the temporary increase in demand for oil as a result of unfavourable meteorological conditions in Europe and in some areas of the United States.",
        "Certain Council members expected that a further increase in oil prices was likely in the nearest future.",
        "The Council members underlined that the major central banks were continuing their highly expansionary monetary policy, including maintaining low interest rates and continuing asset purchases.",
        "The majority of Council members drew attention to the fact that the ECB had announced the continued monetary support even after the end of the pandemic and the economic crisis.",
        "The ECB had also announced that it would not adjust its monetary policy in response to the current, temporary rise in inflation.",
        "Also, the Federal Reserve of the United States reiterated that it would conduct an accommodative monetary policy until an improvement was seen in the achievement of the bank’s objectives.",
        "When referring to the Polish economy, it was pointed out that preliminary data on national accounts for 2020 Q4 confirmed that GDP had fallen in this period.",
        "Activity had declined under the influence of a fall in consumption and lower investment than a year ago However, the scale of the fall in GDP had been limited by the positive impact of net exports.",
        "The majority of the Council members judged that at the beginning of 2021 the economic conditions in Poland remained weakened, with the situation varying between sectors.",
        "It was observed that incoming data pointed to the continued, relatively good situation in industry, particularly in sectors oriented to exports.",
        "At the same time, it was underlined that industrial output growth had declined in January, while production oriented to the domestic market had risen much slower than export production.",
        "It was judged that along with the fall in retail sales, this suggested a weakening of domestic demand, which was limited by the restrictions in force.",
        "It was pointed out that this was accompanied by a fall in construction and assembly output in January.",
        "The Council members judged that the situation in the labour market remained favourable.",
        "However, it was observed that in January it had deteriorated somewhat, as was indicated by the fall in average employment in the enterprise sector in this period.",
        "The Council members observed that a rise in economic activity was expected in 2021, although the scale and speed of the recovery were uncertain.",
        "The further course of the pandemic and its impact on the economic situation in Poland and abroad continued to be the main source of uncertainty.",
        "It was underlined that according to NBP’s March projection, following the fall in GDP in 2021 Q1, the following quarters would see growth in economic activity supported by rising exports and a strengthening of domestic demand.",
        "It was observed that the economic policy measures implemented so far, including the easing of NBP’s monetary policy and the expected recovery in the global economy, would have a positive impact on the economic situation.",
        "In 2022 GDP growth would be additionally supported by the inflow of European Union funds, and – in line with NBP’s March projection – economic growth would be higher than in 2021.",
        "The majority of Council members judged that the risk for the realisation of the forecast scenario of GDP growth was currently high.",
        "They underlined that the pace of the improvement in the domestic economy would depend not only on the further course of the pandemic, but also on the response of economic entities to the normalisation of the epidemic situation, particularly in regard to savings and investment.",
        "Moreover, these Council members observed that the pace of the economic recovery in Poland might be reduced by the lack of a visible and more durable zloty exchange rate adjustment to the global pandemic shock and to the monetary policy easing introduced by NBP.",
        "When discussing price developments, the Council members pointed out that according to the Statistics Poland flash estimate, inflation stood at 2.7% y/y in January.",
        "It was observed that the slight increase in price growth compared to December 2020 was almost entirely the result of faster growth in energy prices, related to an increase in administered tariffs for electrical energy and higher global oil prices.",
        "It was underlined that these factors were negative supply shocks and were beyond the control of domestic monetary policy.",
        "Council members observed that in the coming months, with price growth being boosted by the base effect in fuel prices and the current increase in global oil prices, inflation might pick up.",
        "The majority of Council members pointed out that in the whole 2021 regulatory factors, such as the rise in the price of electricity and in waste disposal charges, would continue to drive inflation up.",
        "Those members also stressed that those were factors beyond the scope of monetary policy control.",
        "They also observed that despite the expected improvement in economic conditions, the output gap in 2021 would remain negative, constraining inflation growth.",
        "Referring to the prospects for inflation in the subsequent years, it was pointed out that they were surrounded with considerable uncertainty.",
        "It was pointed out that according to the central path of the March projection, inflation was expected to be slightly lower in 2022 than this year and run at 2.8%, while in 2023 it might increase to 3.2%, as the previous recovery in activity gradually fed into prices.",
        "The majority of Council members observed that, should epidemic developments take an undesirable course, activity might take longer to rebound than currently expected, which would also postpone the anticipated rise in the demand pressure.",
        "At the same time, those members expressed the view that as economic activity recovered and the impact of the pandemic faded, factors that had acted to limit price growth in earlier years would resurface, including the increasing globalisation of services and mounting competition in the global economy.",
        "In the opinion of the majority of the Council members, inflation might be additionally curbed by the increase in the automation and digitalisation of production of goods and some services related to the pandemic crisis.",
        "Certain Council members, on the other hand, assessed that inflation might prove higher than forecast, due to, among other things, the realisation of pent-up demand after the restrictions had been lifted.",
        "Certain Council members also argued that price growth might be boosted by constraints on the supply of commodities and raw materials amid a rise in demand for semi-products during the economic recovery.",
        "These members also judged that the changes in the global value chains might be permanent, and hence their operation after the pandemic would not be a factor dampening price growth.",
        "Council members assessed that the activities of NBP taken so far, aimed at reducing the economic cost of the pandemic, had been effective.",
        "They highlighted the relatively strong GDP data for 2020, according to which the decline in GDP in Poland was less than half the average of EU countries.",
        "They also underlined that despite the considerable scale of the shock, the situation in the labour market remained good, as indicated by the still low unemployment rate and continued relatively rapid wage growth, also in real terms.",
        "Furthermore, they observed that the fairly favourable financial situation of Polish firms and households was demonstrated by the substantial increase in the funds held on their bank accounts.",
        "While discussing monetary policy, Council members were of the opinion that at the current meeting interest rates should be kept unchanged and the remaining measures of NBP should be continued.",
        "The majority of the Council members judged that if economic recovery progressed in 2021 and price growth in medium term was in line with the inflation target, it would also be advisable to keep interest rates unchanged in the subsequent quarters.",
        "At the same time, in the opinion of these Council members, if the economic conditions and outlook were to deteriorate significantly, e.g.",
        "due to a new surge in the pandemic, further monetary policy easing might be justified, including by a reduction in the interest rate.",
        "Certain Council members believed that, should further easing of monetary conditions be necessary, a further cut in the NBP interest rates would not be advisable and instead additional measures aimed at supporting corporate lending should be implemented.",
        "In the opinion of these Council members NBP should exert greater impact on the longer end of yield curve in order to improve the effectiveness of monetary policy in limiting the increase in yields on government bonds and government-guaranteed debt securities.",
        "Certain Council members argued that should a sharp rise in inflationary pressure appear in the coming quarters, it might be advisable to consider raising NBP interest rates in the second half of 2021.",
        "At the same time, the majority of Council members emphasised that the experience of other central banks pointed to a strong negative economic impact of tightening monetary policy too quickly.",
        "It was observed that NBP’s monetary policy mitigated the negative economic impact of the pandemic, supported economic activity and stabilised inflation at the level consistent with NBP’s medium-term inflation target.",
        "Due to its positive impact on the financial situation of debtors, it was also conducive to the strengthening of financial system stability.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 0.10%, the lombard rate at 0.50%, the deposit rate at 0.00%, the rediscount rate at 0.11%, and the discount rate at 0.12%.",
        "During the discussion, the Council members pointed out that in the recent period the pandemic situation varied across the world.",
        "It was emphasised that Asia had seen a considerable deterioration in the epidemic situation, mainly due to a rapid rise in the number of COVID infections in India.",
        "The number of COVID cases was also heightened in many European countries, although it had started to drop slightly at the end of April.",
        "It was pointed out that heightened uncertainty about the further course of the pandemic persisted with the appearance of new virus mutations.",
        "The majority of Council members judged that further, periodical increases in COVID-19 cases could not be ruled out along with the resulting strengthening of the sanitary regime.",
        "At the same time, these members pointed out that thanks to the progress of the vaccination process, any new waves of the pandemic in Europe would be likely to see fewer COVID cases and a less severe course of the disease.",
        "It was emphasized that the incoming data suggested that world industry had adjusted to functioning under the pandemic and that activity in this sector had increased significantly.",
        "However, it was pointed out that the output of goods in some branches of industry was limited by disruptions in international transport and temporary shortages of intermediate goods and materials.",
        "The majority of the Council members judged that the impact of those factors on activity in world industry over the longer run would fade.",
        "The favourable situation in world industry also translated into growing activity of this sector in the euro area.",
        "At the same time, the situation in the services sector of this economy remained significantly less favourable.",
        "As a result, GDP in 2021 Q1 had declined again.",
        "Referring to the outlook for the euro area, it was pointed out that the forecasts indicated a recovery in this economy in the second half of 2021.",
        "Yet, the majority of the Council members judged that such a scenario was subject to considerable uncertainty and depended on the further development of the pandemic situation.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that even in the case of a favourable development of the economic situation, the forecasts pointed to a drop in price growth in the euro area in 2022.",
        "In this context it was emphasised that the currently observed rise in inflation in Europe was temporary and was mainly caused by the impact of supply-side factors and a considerable rise in prices of many commodities, including crude oil, compared to the corresponding period of 2021.",
        "Certain Council members judged that the growth in oil prices in the recent period had been driven by the current and projected rise in demand for oil and one-off events having a temporary curbing effect on oil supply.",
        "These members also pointed to the growth in copper prices.",
        "The major central banks – including the ECB and the Fed – continue their highly accommodative monetary policy and emphasise in their communications the considerable uncertainty about the prospects for the economy and the temporary nature of the factors boosting inflation in 2021.",
        "In particular, these banks are keeping interest rates low and conducting assets purchases, as well as signalling the maintenance of loose monetary policy in the future.",
        "When referring to the situation in Poland, it was pointed out that the recent period had seen a gradual decline in the number of COVID-19 cases, which was indicative of the fading of the third wave of the pandemic.",
        "The improvement in the epidemic situation had made it possible to gradually ease the sanitary restrictions.",
        "At the same, it was emphasised that the restrictions which had been in place in the earlier period had exerted a negative impact on activity in parts of the trade and services sectors.",
        "This was reflected in a monthover-month decline in retail sales observed in March.",
        "This was accompanied by a further, considerable annual decline in the construction and assembly output.",
        "In turn, in March the situation in industry remained favourable, with a further rise in production both in sectors dominated by exports as well as in more domestically-oriented sectors.",
        "At the same time, the considerable rise in industrial output in year-on-year terms observed in March was largely the result of the base effect caused by the previous year’s economic downturn at the outbreak of the pandemic.",
        "The majority of Council members judged that despite the favourable situation in industry, annual GDP growth in 2021 Q1 had remained negative.",
        "They expressed the opinion that subdued investment demand, driven by the persisting uncertainty about the economic outlook, had had a negative impact on economic growth.",
        "They pointed out that the investment rebound would probably occur only after the epidemic had been brought under control.",
        "While analysing the labour market situation, the Council members pointed out that in March 2021 average employment in the enterprise sector had declined and that the registered unemployment rate had been slightly above the level recorded at the end of 2020.",
        "At the same time, the majority of the Council members judged that in 2021 Q1 the rise in the average wage in the entire economy had probably remained below the pre-pandemic level.",
        "In turn, in the opinion of these Council members, the pick-up in wage growth in the enterprise sector in March had partly been the result of base effects and the delayed payment of holiday bonuses.",
        "While referring to the economic outlook, the Council members pointed out that the available forecasts suggested that the subsequent quarters would bring economic recovery.",
        "They underlined that the scale and pace of recovery remained uncertain, mainly due to uncertain further course of the pandemic.",
        "The majority of the Council members expressed the opinion that despite the progress of the vaccination process, subsequent waves of the pandemic in Poland could not be ruled out.",
        "However, they judged that any subsequent waves of the pandemic might bring fewer number of COVID cases, less severe sanitary restrictions and – as a result – less negative impact on the economic situation.",
        "Certain Council members judged that the pandemic would probably no longer have a significant impact on economic activity.",
        "Members of the Council upheld their opinion that economic policy measures, including the last year’s easing of NBP monetary policy, as well as the anticipated recovery in the global economy would have a positive impact on domestic activity.",
        "In their opinion, the pace of the domestic economic recovery would also be dependent upon further developments of the zloty exchange rate.",
        "While discussing the price developments, members of the Council pointed out that in line with the GUS flash estimate inflation in April rose to 4.3% y/y.",
        "It was pointed out that the rise in inflation was primarily driven by a further rise in fuel prices – which was connected with crude oil prices in the global markets considerably exceeding the previous year’s level – as well as higher food prices.",
        "At the same time, the annual inflation rate continued to be boosted by increase in electricity prices at the beginning of the year and rising waste disposal charges, namely factors which – similarly to the rise in commodity prices – are beyond the control of the domestic monetary policy.",
        "Attention was also paid to the fact that inflation was also boosted by growing costs of international transport and temporary disruptions in global value chains.",
        "The majority of the Council members assessed that although the relatively favourable income situation of households also contributed to price increases, its impact on inflation was not excessive and – on its own – had not resulted in price growth exceeding the inflation target.",
        "With reference to inflation in the remaining part of the year, members of the Council assessed that the said supply and administrative factors were likely to cause the annual inflation rate to remain above the upper limit of deviations from the inflation target in the coming months.",
        "Certain Council members expressed the opinion that inflation might be additionally boosted by the postponed household spending after the lockdown restrictions had been lifted.",
        "Yet, the majority of the Council members pointed out that the impact of this factor would be short-lived.",
        "When analysing the outlook for inflation in the longer run it was pointed out that in 2022, after factors having a temporary boosting effect on price growth had faded away, inflation is expected to decline.",
        "At the same time it was pointed out that price developments in 2022 would depend on the sustainability of the economic recovery, including on the future situation in the labour market after COVID relief programmes had been terminated.",
        "Certain Council members judged that inflation might remain heightened in 2022.",
        "Certain Council members pointed out that price growth observed in the recent period translated into a decline of interest rates further below zero.",
        "Those members assessed that the negative real interest rate of bank deposits was deterring households from keeping bank deposits and urging them to seek alternative way of investing savings, thus boosting prices of certain assets.",
        "Yet, other members of the Council indicated that household deposits were posting a considerable growth in year-on-year terms.",
        "This was coupled with limited household liabilities resulting from consumer loans and a drop in corporate debt resulting from bank loans.",
        "While discussing monetary policy, the majority of the Council members decided that interest rates should be kept unchanged at the current MPC meeting and the other measures undertaken by NBP should be further pursued.",
        "Those members assessed that the heightened inflation level was the result of supply and external factors, namely factors which are beyond the control of the monetary policy, whose impact on price growth would probably be temporary.",
        "At the same time those members pointed out that the Polish economy had just embarked on a path to make up for the losses caused by the pandemic and sustainability of the currently observed recovery in the longer term was subject to uncertainty.",
        "Therefore – in the opinion of the majority of the Council members – NBP should support sustainability of the economic recovery, by ensuring favourable financing conditions to all economic agents.",
        "The majority of the Council members assessed that, if the uncertainty about the further course of the pandemic, and – as a result – the future economic conditions continue, with the rise in inflation above the target being the result of the factors beyond the control of the monetary policy, it would be advisable to keep interest rates unchanged also in the months to come.",
        "In their opinion, the tightening of monetary conditions in response to inflation running above the inflation target as result of negative supply shocks would not curb price growth in 2021, while it could halt economic recovery after a considerable economic downturn caused by the pandemic.",
        "Certain Council members argued that if inflationary pressure intensify markedly in the coming months, it might be justified to consider an increase in the NBP interest rates.",
        "At the same time, the majority of the Council members emphasised that such an adjustment would be justified only after the pandemic had come to an end, the economic recovery had consolidated and there was a risk of an excessive rise in inflation driven by demand factors.",
        "The Council rejected the motion to raise the required reserve ratio to 3.5% and the motion to lower the interest rate of required reserve holdings from the NBP reference rate (currently at 0.1%) to 0.01% The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 0.10%; the lombard rate at 0.50%; the deposit rate at 0.00%; the rediscount rate at 0.11% and the discount rate at 0.12%.",
        "At the Council meeting it was pointed out that May had seen an improvement in the pandemic situation around the world.",
        "Nevertheless, significant uncertainty about the further development of the global pandemic persisted.",
        "In many countries, particularly in developing ones, the vaccination process was slow and the epidemic situation remained difficult.",
        "In many countries vaccination of a sufficient proportion of the population, which would allow to contain the epidemic without the need to introduce restrictions in the future, will be challenging.",
        "The gradual easing of sanitary restrictions in the recent period had led to an improvement in business conditions in the services sector in many economies, including in the euro area.",
        "At the same time, economic indicators in industry suggested a further recovery in activity in this sector, and in certain markets supply-side constraints were emerging.",
        "However, much of incoming data is heavily distorted by statistical base effects and the realisation of pent-up demand by some households and firms, which temporarily boosted expenditure on certain goods and services.",
        "The Council members drew attention to the fact that the rebound in economic activity currently under way in many economies was taking place following the sharpest fall in GDP in decades.",
        "In this context certain Council members underlined that in the euro area GDP was significantly lower than before the pandemic and that employment was still falling in 2021 Q1.",
        "It was judged that the recovery was contributing to the rise in commodity prices in the global markets, including in oil prices, which were significantly higher than a year earlier.",
        "Along with base effects, a rise in international transport costs, and supply-side disruptions related to the pandemic, which were taking place amid the opening of economies following the last wave of the pandemic, this was boosting global inflation.",
        "Some Council members underlined that in the United States the annual inflation rate had exceeded 4% and was the highest for a dozen or so years, while core inflation was the highest for three decades.",
        "These Council members underlined that inflation in the euro area had also risen significantly in recent months.",
        "During the discussion it was pointed out that despite a significant rise in inflation in the United States, the Federal Reserve was keeping interest rates close to zero, was conducting asset purchases, and had not signalled a tightening of monetary policy, while pointing out that heightened inflation was transitory.",
        "At the same time, the European Central Bank declared that it would continue its pandemic emergency purchase programme until at least March 2022.",
        "As a result, the financial markets expected that the ECB’s deposit rate would remain negative at least for the following 3 years.",
        "When assessing the situation in Poland, the Council members pointed out that 2021 Q1 had seen a 0.9% fall in GDP in annual terms.",
        "However, it was underlined that annual growth in consumption and investment was slightly positive.",
        "It was pointed out that investment had been boosted by enterprises investing in means of transport and machinery and equipment.",
        "At the same time, it was noted that consumer demand had not yet returned to the prepandemic level, which confirmed that the elevated inflation was not related to excessive growth in demand.",
        "The Council members judged that the easing of the epidemic restrictions had had a positive impact on the economic situation in the recent period.",
        "However, it was underlined that the incoming monthly data should be interpreted with caution, since in March and April most annual macroeconomic indicators had been heavily distorted by statistical base effects.",
        "In recent months the incoming data had indicated a further improvement in economic conditions, with persisting differences between sectors.",
        "In April 2021, annual industrial output growth and retail sales growth had risen significantly.",
        "However, it was underlined that while industrial output in April had been higher than before the pandemic, retail sales had still not reached the pre-pandemic level.",
        "At the same time, annual growth in construction and assembly output had remained clearly negative.",
        "Attention was drawn to the improvement in consumer sentiment, which, however, remained less optimistic than before the pandemic, and to the improved financial results of enterprises.",
        "While analysing the labour market situation, the Council members underlined that although annual employment growth in the enterprise sector had been positive in April 2021, in monthly terms employment had fallen and remained lower than before the outbreak of the pandemic.",
        "Moreover, a large number of jobs continued to be subsidised by public funds.",
        "The unemployment rate remained higher than before the pandemic.",
        "During the Council meeting it was pointed out that in 2021 Q1 wage growth in the economy had remained lower than before the pandemic.",
        "Although annual wage growth in enterprises had picked up in April, after excluding base effects it remained close to that observed in 2021 Q1 in the whole economy.",
        "At the same time, some Council members emphasised that corporate revenue had risen much faster than wages in 2021 Q1.",
        "As a result, they judged that there was no cost pressure in the economy that would result from excessive wage growth.",
        "These Council members also pointed to the further rise in the number of immigrants last year, which might curb any potential tensions in the labour market related to a shortage of employees.",
        "On the other hand, certain Council members drew attention to the fact that a significant number of surveyed firms reported upward pressure on wages from employees.",
        "The majority of the Council members were of the opinion that lending growth remained low and was not contributing to inflation rising above the NBP inflation target.",
        "It was pointed out that in May 2021 annual credit growth in the economy had stood at 2.5%.",
        "Credit growth had been supported by a further increase in housing loans; however, in the case of enterprises annual lending growth had remained markedly negative while consumer credit growth had been close to zero.",
        "However, the majority of the Council members judged that housing loan growth remained moderate and lower than wage growth.",
        "Against this backdrop certain Council members underlined that annual growth in prices of residential real estate was significantly positive; however, in recent quarters it had declined and demand in this market was partly related to the activity of foreign investors due to the persistence of low interest rates abroad.",
        "On the other hand, while discussing monetary aggregates, certain Council members pointed out that money supply had risen significantly in recent quarters and public debt was a significant factor contributing to its creation.",
        "At the Council meeting it was pointed out that according to the GUS preliminary data, May saw an increase in annual CPI to 4.8% (in monthly terms CPI stood at 0.3% and decreased as compared with the previous month).",
        "In particular, rapid growth in fuel prices in annual terms was observed, which was the result of growth in global oil prices and strong base effects.",
        "At the same time, annual food price growth picked up.",
        "The majority of the Council members underlined that annual inflation also continued to be elevated by other factors beyond the influence of domestic monetary policy, including the increase in electricity prices which took place at the beginning of the year and the increase in waste disposal charges.",
        "In this context, these Council members drew attention to the fact that according to the full data for April, the increase in fuel prices and prices of goods and administered services accounted for almost half of the CPI inflation rate.",
        "As a result, the majority of the Council members judged that although demand factors also supported price growth, they were not causing inflation to exceed the inflation target.",
        "While discussing inflation expectations, some Council members pointed out that, although in surveys consumers noticed price growth, the balance statistics describing trends in consumer opinions on future changes in prices had shifted towards lower inflation in recent months and had reached the lowest level for 2 years.",
        "These Council members also underlined that although inflation forecasts of financial sector analysts had recently remained elevated, they continued to indicate a gradual decline in inflation in the coming years.",
        "On the other hand, certain Council members pointed out that a significant number of entrepreneurs expected faster price growth in the future.",
        "These Council members also judged that although inflation expectations of households were not rising, the majority of them expected inflation in the future to be close to the level that is observed currently.",
        "The majority of the Council members judged that as a result of factors beyond the influence of domestic monetary policy, annual inflation in the coming months was likely to remain above the upper limit of deviations from the inflation target.",
        "However, the majority of the Council members were of the opinion that next year, after the factors temporarily boosting price growth fade, a decline in inflation was expected.",
        "These Council members also pointed out that the development of inflation in 2022 would depend on the robustness of the economic recovery, including the labour market situation following the phasing out of the anti-crisis measures.",
        "The Council members also drew attention to the fact that the level of inflation next year would depend on the fiscal policy stance.",
        "Certain Council members were of the opinion that forecasts pointing to a decline in inflation in the coming quarters were subject to uncertainty.",
        "They pointed out that amid the ongoing economic recovery, the observed rise in inflation above the NBP inflation target might lead to an increase in inflation expectations and the consolidation of inflation at a level above the NBP inflation target in the coming quarters.",
        "Certain Council members judged that the growth in money supply might also boost inflation.",
        "The majority of the Council members were of the opinion that the present meeting should keep interest rates unchanged and continue to pursue the NBP’s remaining measures.",
        "These Council members judged that the monetary policy conducted by NBP supported the consolidation of economic recovery following the pandemic-induced recession and stabilised inflation at the level consistent with the NBP’s inflation target in the medium term.",
        "They drew attention to the fact that keeping the NBP interest rates unchanged was currently justified due to the sources and the expected temporary nature of inflation exceeding the NBP’s target, as well as the uncertainty about the persistence and scale of the economic recovery.",
        "The Council members underlined that as indicated in Monetary Policy Guidelines for 2021, due to the macroeconomic and financial shocks, inflation may temporarily deviate from the target and even run outside the band for deviations from the target.",
        "The response of monetary policy to the shocks is flexible and depends on their causes and the assessment of persistence of their effects, including their impact on inflation developments.",
        "The majority of the Council members judged that if the uncertainty about the further course of the pandemic, and – as a result – the future economic conditions continued, and if the rise in inflation above the target was the result of factors beyond the control of monetary policy, it would be advisable to keep interest rates unchanged also in the near future.",
        "In their opinion, the tightening of monetary conditions in response to inflation running above the inflation target due to negative supply shocks and regulatory factors, would not curb price growth in 2021, while it could halt economic recovery following a considerable economic downturn caused by the pandemic.",
        "Some Council members judged that future incoming data and forecasts, including the July NBP projection, would be helpful in assessing the robustness of the economic recovery and the outlook for inflation.",
        "These Council members judged that if forecasts indicated robust economic growth in the coming years, with inflation remaining permanently above the NBP inflation target due to increased demand and persistently favourable situation in the labour market, amid fading uncertainty about pandemic it would be possible to adjust monetary policy.",
        "However, certain Council members were of the opinion that the NBP reference rate should be raised at the current meeting.",
        "They assessed that inflation would remain above 3.5% in the following four quarters.",
        "In the opinion of these Council members, the increase in the reference rate could reduce the risk of an increase in inflation expectations and strengthening of wage pressure and thus it would mitigate the risk of inflation running above the NBP inflation target in the medium term.",
        "The Council rejected the motion to raise the reference rate by 15 basis points.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 0.10%, the lombard rate at 0.50%, the deposit rate at 0.00%, the rediscount rate at 0.11%, and the discount rate at 0.12%.",
        "At the Council meeting, it was pointed out that over the recent period the pandemic situation around the world had worsened, particularly as a result of the spread of the Delta variant of the coronavirus.",
        "It was underlined that uncertainty about the further course of the pandemic persisted, which in many countries was due to the still relatively low vaccination rates.",
        "At the same time, it was indicated that in countries with high vaccination rates the number of infections with the new variant of the virus was also growing.",
        "The Council members were of the opinion that at the moment it was difficult to assess how the rise in COVID cases would affect the economic situation around the world, and that the further development of the pandemic continued to represent a significant risk factor for the durability of the global recovery.",
        "Alongside that, GDP data for 2021 Q2 confirmed a sharp rise in economic activity in the largest economies in that period, including a recovery in the services sector as a result of the easing of the previously introduced restrictions to control the spread of COVID.",
        "However, it was underlined that the high annual growth rates reflected to a large extent the low reference base in 2020.",
        "It was pointed out that in the United States, although economic activity had already returned to the pre-pandemic level, output gap was still negative, and recently – along with the rise in the number of infections – some deterioration in sentiment had been observed as well as slightly worse data from the labour market.",
        "In turn, the euro area, including Germany, were still making up for the economic losses resulting from the pandemic, which, according to available forecasts, would not be accomplished until next year.",
        "It was also pointed out that in 2021 Q3 some economic indicators for the Chinese economy had declined.",
        "Attention was drawn to the fact that economic activity abroad was to a large extent affected by the inadequate supply of certain semi-finished products and the ongoing difficulties with their transport.",
        "It was observed that the global rebound in activity was contributing to the rise in prices of many commodities, including energy commodities and metal prices, which were currently significantly higher than a year earlier.",
        "Certain Council members were of the opinion that oil prices would most likely continue to rise.",
        "However, according to the majority of the Council members, even with growing demand oil price growth should slow down.",
        "At the same time, it was underlined that in recent months the prices of certain agricultural commodities around the world had also risen significantly.",
        "The Council members pointed out that higher commodity prices along with supply-chain disruptions in certain markets and realisation of pent-up demand, had led to a significant rise in inflation in many economies, including in the United States and the euro area.",
        "At the same time, it was emphasised that, due to the forecast temporary nature of the current rise in inflation, the still subdued economic activity compared to the pre-pandemic trends and uncertainty about the future economic situation, the major central banks were keeping interest rates low, continuing asset purchases, and signalling the maintenance of loose monetary policy in the future.",
        "Some Council members underlined that uncertainty about the course of the next wave of the pandemic was prompting many central banks to take a cautious stance towards the tightening of monetary conditions.",
        "However, certain Council members pointed out that elevated inflation had prompted certain central banks of the Central and Eastern European region – the Czech National Bank and the Central Bank of Hungary – to raise interest rates.",
        "When assessing the situation in Poland, the Council members indicated that according to the Statistics Poland flash estimate for 2021 Q2, annual GDP growth had risen to 11.1% y/y, while the main factor supporting the rebound in economic activity was strong growth in private consumption driven by pent-up demand and – to a lesser extent – investment growth.",
        "The Council members observed that although the very high annual GDP growth was mainly due to the low base effect, significant GDP growth had also been sustained in quarterly terms.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that although the data confirmed that GDP had made up for the losses caused by the recession in 2020, activity had still not reached the level determined by the pre-pandemic trend.",
        "The Council members judged that the economic outlook remained good – particularly in view of the favourable situation in industry, including in the export-oriented sections.",
        "It was assessed that in the coming quarters a further recovery in economic activity would take place.",
        "At the same time, the majority of the Council members underlined that the pace of the further recovery was subject to significant uncertainty, mainly due to the future course of the pandemic.",
        "It was also pointed out that both supply-chain disruptions and the exhaustion of the pent-up demand could limit the pace of GDP growth.",
        "In this context it was indicated that in July 2021 annual growth in retail sales and in industrial and construction output had declined (which was only partially the result of base effects).",
        "Yet, certain Council members pointed out that uncertainty about the further recovery is limited due to the high vaccination rate in Poland and adaptability skills of Polish entrepreneurs.",
        "While analysing the labour market situation, the Council members underlined that it remained good.",
        "In particular, the LFS data for 2021 Q2 indicated an improvement in the domestic labour market situation in this period.",
        "At the same time, average employment in the national economy had not yet reached the pre-pandemic level, and the wages of some employees from the sectors most affected by the earlier restrictions were still subsidised under the anti-crisis support.",
        "It was also observed that in July 2021 growth in average employment in the enterprise sector had slowed down in annual terms and annual growth in average wages in this sector had declined slightly.",
        "The majority of the Council members also pointed out that in view of the strong growth in labour productivity, annual growth in unit labour costs in the economy had fallen close to zero in 2021 Q2, and had been negative in industry for several months.",
        "In the opinion of certain Council members, elevated inflation might boost wage demands of various occupational groups, which would mean that in the coming quarters wage pressure could rise.",
        "At the meeting, it was pointed out that according to the Statistics Poland flash estimate, inflation in Poland rose to 5.4% y/y in August 2021, and fell to 0.2% in monthly terms.",
        "The majority of the Council members emphasised that elevated inflation was to a large extent the result of the rise in fuel prices due to the significantly higher global oil prices than a year ago, and also due to the rise in food prices, which was, among others, a result of the spread of ASF and avian flu as well as unfavourable weather conditions.",
        "At the same time, the annual inflation rate continued to be pushed up by the increase in electricity prices at the beginning of 2021, as well as the increases in waste disposal charges, i.e.",
        "by factors that – like the rising commodity prices – were beyond the control of domestic monetary policy.",
        "These Council members observed that inflation was also driven up by the increase in the operating costs of enterprises in pandemic conditions and the costs of international transport, as well as temporary disruptions to global supply chains.",
        "Given that according to data for July, growth in prices of fuel, energy and other administered prices accounted for over half of the CPI inflation rate, the majority of the Council members judged that demand-side factors were not causing excessive inflation, and neither had they caused inflation to exceed the inflation target.",
        "Alongside that, the Council members observed that although the favourable economic conditions and the realisation of the pent-up demand also supported the current growth in prices, what is essential for monetary policy is how long would the impact of domestic demand factors on inflation last.",
        "The Council members judged that in 2022, after some factors currently boosting price growth fade, inflation was expected to decline.",
        "However, the scale of this decline would depend on the strength of the economic recovery, including the developments in the labour market following the phasing out of the anti-crisis measures, as well as on the impact of probable subsequent regulatory and supply shocks, including further increases in electricity and gas prices.",
        "Certain Council members pointed out that the high readings of CPI in recent months might translate into an upward revision of the expected inflation path for the coming months.",
        "In their opinion, the risk that inflation would not return to the band of deviations from the NBP inflation target in the coming quarters had risen.",
        "Some Council members observed that climate policy measures would be a factor increasing inflation also in the long-term perspective, since they may permanently boost not only energy prices, but also prices of other goods containing a so-called carbon footprint.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that the possible realisation of the risk associated with the pandemic could reduce economic growth in the coming quarters and thus also reduce demand pressure on prices.",
        "Certain Council members highlighted the robust growth in mortgage loans to households.",
        "In the opinion of those Council members, a continuation of accommodative monetary policy might increase the risk of excessive growth in housing loans.",
        "Other Council members, however, pointed out that the demand for mortgage loans was to a great extent related to meeting households’ housing needs and that loans were granted to people with adequate credit standing.",
        "The majority of the Council members were of the opinion that the present meeting should keep interest rates unchanged and continue to pursue NBP’s remaining measures.",
        "These Council members judged that the monetary policy conducted by NBP supported the consolidation of economic recovery following the pandemic-induced recession and stabilised inflation at the level consistent with NBP’s inflation target in the medium term.",
        "They drew attention to the fact that keeping NBP interest rates unchanged was currently justified due to the causes of inflation exceeding NBP’s target, as well as the continued uncertainty about the robustness and scale of the economic recovery in light of the risks related to the next wave of the pandemic.",
        "In their opinion, the tightening of monetary conditions in response to inflation running above the inflation target due to negative supply shocks and regulatory factors would not curb price growth in 2021, while it could halt the economic recovery following the considerable economic downturn caused by the pandemic.",
        "At the same time, the majority of the Council members judged that in the coming months of significant importance to monetary policy would be the assessment of the impact of the next wave of the pandemic on the economy and the assessment of the outlook for activity and inflation in the subsequent years.",
        "In the opinion of the majority of the Council members, should the uncertainty about the pandemic and its impact on the economy subside, and forecasts suggest a continuation of favourable economic conditions and the risk of inflation running above the NBP’s inflation target in the coming years, it would be warranted to consider adjusting monetary policy.",
        "In this context, the results of the November projection of inflation and GDP will also be important.",
        "Certain Council members were of the opinion that the NBP interest rates should be raised at the current meeting.",
        "They drew attention to the fact that price growth was currently significantly elevated and that demand factors were also boosting prices.",
        "They also judged that heightened inflation expectations and the increased wage pressure might lead to the consolidation of inflation above the NBP’s target.",
        "In the opinion of these Council members, an increase in the interest rates could reduce such a risk and support the development of inflation at a level consistent with the NBP’s inflation target.",
        "The Council rejected the motion to raise the NBP interest rates to the following levels: the reference rate to 2.00%, the lombard rate to 3.00%, the deposit rate to 1.00%, the rediscount rate to 2.01%, and the discount rate to 2.02%, and to set the interest rate on required reserves at 1%.",
        "The Council rejected the motion to raise the reference rate by 15 basis points.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 0.10%, the lombard rate at 0.50%, the deposit rate at 0.00%, the rediscount rate at 0.11%, and the discount rate at 0.12%.",
        "At the Council meeting, it was observed that the recovery in global economic activity was continuing.",
        "It was emphasised that owing to further activity growth, many economies had already made up for the pandemic-induced losses.",
        "It was observed that preliminary GDP data for 2021 Q3 pointed to continued favourable economic conditions in the United States as well as the euro area, where economic growth was markedly above the forecasts.",
        "It was stressed that the economic situation in the euro area remained good despite the adverse effect of supply-side disruptions on the economic climate in industry, and was supported by the substantial activity rebound in the service sector.",
        "It was underlined that current forecasts pointed to further global activity growth in 2022.",
        "At the same time, the risk of global GDP growth below the current forecasts was deemed to prevail.",
        "In this context, it was pointed out that the difficult epidemiological situation persisting in many countries, along with the supply constraints in some markets and a sharp rise in commodity prices, were having a downward effect on activity in some economies.",
        "The slowdown in GDP growth in China in 2021 Q3, driven by pandemic disruptions and the economic policy pursued by Chinese authorities, was also highlighted.",
        "It was observed that commodity prices in the global markets continued to be substantially higher than a year ago.",
        "It was indicated that gas prices, despite a recent correction, were still several times higher than in the autumn of 2020.",
        "Oil and coal also continued to be more expensive.",
        "Certain Council members were of the opinion that the rise in energy commodity prices was driven by both demand factors – such as the ongoing recovery in the global economy after the pandemic crisis – and supply constraints due to the oil production policy of OPEC+ and Russia’s gas export policy.",
        "It was observed that another factor boosting energy prices in Europe was the sharp rise in the prices of CO2 emission allowances.",
        "Food price growth, driven up by rising global prices of some agricultural commodities, was also highlighted.",
        "It was emphasised that these factors, together with disruptions in global supply chains and a steep rise in international transport costs, were contributing to a substantial rise in inflation in many countries.",
        "It was pointed out that price growth in many countries, including the United States and the euro area, was well above the central banks’ inflation targets, running at highest levels in decades.",
        "It was also observed that according to forecasts, global price growth would also remain elevated in 2022, a development which in the summer 2021 had not yet been anticipated.",
        "It was emphasised that despite rising inflation, major central banks were keeping interest rates low and were conducting asset purchases.",
        "At the same time, given the growing risk of higher inflation lasting longer than previously forecast, some of those banks were signalling a reduction in the scale of monetary accommodation.",
        "In particular, the Federal Reserve was hinting at embarking on a gradual reduction in the scale of net asset purchases later this year.",
        "At the same time, it was underscored that central banks in Central and Eastern Europe, as well as in some advanced economies, were already raising interest rates.",
        "While analysing the situation in the Polish economy, Council members drew attention to the ongoing economic recovery.",
        "Incoming data and estimates suggest that the relatively rapid economic growth, exceeding 5%, had continued in 2021 Q3.",
        "GDP growth was supported by robust consumer demand, benefiting from a favourable situation in the labour market, which was reflected in a decline in unemployment and a substantial rise in average wages.",
        "Favourable situation also continued in the industry, despite the negative impact of limited supply of some intermediate goods on activity in some branches.",
        "It was judged that the favourable economic situation would probably continue also in the coming quarters.",
        "It was observed that the findings of the November NBP projection also suggested such a scenario.",
        "At the same time, it was indicated that the main factors of uncertainty about the economic outlook were factors likely to have a negative impact on economic activity, including the effects of the pandemic, as well as the impact of supply constraints and high prices of energy commodities on the global economic climate.",
        "At the meeting it was pointed out that according to the Statistics Poland flash estimate, inflation in Poland had risen to 6.8% y/y in October 2021, and stood at 1.0% in monthly terms.",
        "The majority of Council members underlined that heightened inflation was still mainly the result of the impact of external factors beyond the influence of domestic monetary policy, including much higher global prices of energy and agricultural commodities than a year earlier, previous hikes in electricity prices and waste disposal charges, as well as global transport and supply chain disruptions.",
        "At the same time, these Council members judged that the ongoing economic recovery, including demand stimulated by rising household income, had also added to the price growth.",
        "Certain Council members pointed out that this was reflected in an elevated level of core inflation.",
        "These Council members also drew attention to the higher level of inflation expectations than in previous years, in particular, the expectations of enterprises.",
        "They also underlined the importance of the exchange rate channel in the monetary transmission mechanism.",
        "When analysing the inflation outlook, the Council members pointed out that the significant increase in global commodity prices observed in 2021 and the prolonged global supply disruptions had caused a significant increase in inflation forecasts for the coming quarters both globally and in Poland.",
        "The Council members judged that with the expected further recovery in domestic economic activity and the favourable labour market situation, this would create a risk of elevated inflation becoming entrenched over the monetary policy horizon.",
        "Such a risk was also indicated by the results of NBP’s November projection, according to which, without a further adjustment of monetary policy, price growth could run above the NBP inflation target even after the fading of the impact of current pandemic-commodity shock.",
        "Certain Council members expressed the opinion that the risk of elevated price growth becoming entrenched might also be increased by the weakening of structural factors, such as globalisation and changes in retail market structure, which in previous years had reduced price growth in Poland.",
        "When referring to the situation in the credit market, certain Council members underlined that the rise in the value of corporate and consumer loans remained limited.",
        "However, other Council members pointed to the high growth in mortgage loans.",
        "The Council members recognised that, in order to lower inflation to the NBP target in the medium term, NBP interest rates should be raised.",
        "Therefore, the Council decided to raise the reference rate by 0.75 percentage points, i.e.",
        "to 1.25% and to set the remaining NBP interest rates at the following levels: the lombard rate at 1.75%, the deposit rate at 0.75%, the rediscount rate at 1.30%, and the discount rate at 1.35%.",
        "The Council members pointed out that, due to the external causes of the elevated inflation, including growth in fuel prices, and the further forecasted increases in electricity prices– in the near future inflation would continue to significantly exceed the inflation target.",
        "At the same time, they emphasised that the interest rate increases in October and November would reduce the risk of elevated inflation becoming entrenched in the medium term and would have a limiting impact on inflation expectations.",
        "The Council members stated that further monetary policy decisions would depend on the assessment of incoming information on the economic situation, including the outlook for inflation and for economic activity.",
        "During the discussion, the Council members pointed out that the surge in the pandemic, including the spread of new variants of the virus, had recently translated in many countries into tighter restrictions, affecting economic sentiment negatively, although this impact was weaker than during the previous waves of the pandemic.",
        "In particular, this concerned European countries, while the situation in the United States and the United Kingdom, where the vaccination process was more advanced, was slightly better.",
        "It was judged that the surge of the pandemic had delayed the expected recovery in the global economy, although the successive waves of infections had had a limited impact on industrial activity.",
        "Some Council members emphasised that in the slightly longer term, business conditions in industry might depend on the duration and scale of the tightened restrictions and on the elimination of the currently experienced problems with supply of some materials and components.",
        "In this context, attention was also drawn to the persistent downturn in the service sector, especially against the background of renewed restrictions on mobility and the lockdown of certain industries in many countries.",
        "Considering the share of services in GDP, the downturn in this sector was translating into further weakness of economic activity in Europe.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that uncertainty about future developments was on its own a factor dampening investment and consumption.",
        "When referring to the economic situation in the euro area, the Council members observed that higher activity in the industrial sector was accompanied by persistently weak activity in services and retail trade.",
        "The Council members expressed the view that the short-term outlook for activity in the euro area had deteriorated somewhat, as restrictions were now expected to be lifted more slowly, and activity in services would pick up later in comparison with the March projection.",
        "The Council members observed that the impact of the pandemic on the European economies in 2021 Q2 might be mitigated by the expected acceleration of the vaccination process, provided that the vaccines were also effective against the new mutations of the virus.",
        "When referring to the situation in the United States, it was observed that the adoption of the new fiscal package by the US administration, the improved epidemic situation and the fast pace of vaccinations in this country had contributed to an upward revision of forecasts for GDP growth.",
        "The Council members pointed out that the prices of many commodities, including oil, were currently markedly higher than a year ago, which had an upward impact on global inflation.",
        "It was emphasised that rising costs of maritime transport and supply shortages in certain markets also contributed to higher inflation.",
        "At the same time, the majority of the Council members stressed that the external forecasts pointed only to a temporary rise in inflation in 2021, since price growth would be curbed by the persistently negative output gap and slow wage growth, particularly in the euro area, where, according to the forecasts, the unemployment rate would remain elevated.",
        "In this context, it was pointed out that due to the persistent weakness of economic conditions and the uncertainty about the economic outlook, monetary policy of major central banks would remain highly accommodative.",
        "In particular, these central banks were keeping interest rates low, while conducting asset purchases and signalling the maintenance of loose monetary policy in the future.",
        "At its March meeting, the ECB announced an acceleration of the asset purchases, responding to an observed increase in bond yields.",
        "Also, the Fed is maintaining a highly expansionary monetary policy stance.",
        "When referring to the Polish economy, it was pointed out that similarly to many other countries, the epidemic situation in March had deteriorated and the sanitary restrictions had been tightened.",
        "However, the Council members observed that high frequency data indicated that the impact of the epidemic situation on the economy was considerably smaller than before, although GDP forecasts for 2021 Q1 still suggested a decline in GDP year-on-year.",
        "It was observed that activity in some sectors in the first months of the year was closely dependent on the restrictions in place, which translated into a significant curbing of activity in some services, while industrial output continued to grow, supported in particular by sectors with a high share of exports.",
        "At the same time, it was stressed that the decline in construction and assembly output had deepened recently, and annual retail sales growth – despite some improvement in consumer sentiment – had remained negative in February.",
        "Furthermore, attention was drawn to the fact that this had been accompanied by an increase in average employment in the enterprise sector in month-on-month terms, and slower annual average wage growth in this sector.",
        "The Council members observed that economic activity was expected to recover in the following months.",
        "Also, due to the low base in March 2020 – when the outbreak of the epidemic had led to a collapse of economic activity – data for March 2021 might show a strong rise in annual growth of many macroeconomic categories.",
        "Looking at the quarters further ahead, the scenario of continued recovery in the second half of 2021 largely depended on the assumed pace of lifting of the restrictions.",
        "This, in turn, depended on the course of the pandemic and the progress of the vaccination process.",
        "In the opinion of the Council, the main source of uncertainty as regards the scale and pace of recovery continued to be the further course of the pandemic and its impact on economic conditions at home and abroad.",
        "The Council members reiterated the opinion that the macroeconomic policy measures, including the easing of monetary policy by NBP in 2020, and the expected recovery in the global economy would have a positive impact on the domestic economic situation.",
        "In their opinion, the pace of the economic recovery in Poland would also depend on developments in the zloty exchange rate.",
        "When discussing price developments, the Council members pointed out that inflation in March had picked up to 3.2% y/y.",
        "It was observed that inflation was primarily driven by the further increase in fuel prices related to the rising oil prices in the global markets.",
        "At the same time, it was emphasised that annual price growth was being boosted by the rise in energy costs that had taken place at the beginning of the year, and the earlier rises in waste disposal charges, i.e.",
        "factors beyond the scope of domestic monetary policy.",
        "Moreover, it was stressed that the increased operating costs of enterprises due to the pandemic, including higher transport costs and temporary disruptions in global supply chains, also continued to boost inflation.",
        "While analysing the short-term inflation prospects, the Council members observed that the statistical base effects relating to fuel price developments, along with the expected further rise in waste disposal charges, would probably contribute in the coming months to a further increase in annual inflation which could exceed the upper band for deviations from the target.",
        "Some Council members emphasised in this context that the factors temporarily boosting inflation at the moment were to a great extent of a negative supplyshock nature, and remain beyond the influence of domestic monetary policy.",
        "In the opinion of these Council members, as the output gap was persistently negative, there was no excessive demand pressure in the whole economy, and available forecasts indicated a drop in inflation to a level close to 2.5% in 2022.",
        "These members indicated that inflation was also expected to rise in the nearest future in other countries.",
        "Certain Council members argued that mainly the European Union’s climate policy, which among others had caused a considerable rise in the prices of CO2 emission allowances, might translate into higher energy prices also in 2022, thus having a more persistent impact on CPI developments in Poland.",
        "Moreover, certain Council members pointed to constraints in the supply of commodities and intermediate goods, which contributed to an increase in the prices of some products, and to wage pressure reported by the majority of the companies surveyed by NBP, which, in these members’ opinion, might also boost inflation in the slightly longer term.",
        "In this context, these members highlighted the risk of an increase in inflation expectations.",
        "However, the majority of the Council members judged that as the vaccination process progressed and the scale of the epidemic diminished, the impact of global supply factors currently driving up firms’ operating costs would fade.",
        "They also emphasised that wage growth had been weaker so far than before the onset of the pandemic, which would also have a curbing effect on inflation.",
        "The Council members judged that the NBP measures introduced to limit the economic costs of the pandemic had been effective and, along with the fiscal policy measures – which had been supported by the monetary policy easing – they had alleviated the impact of the pandemic on the Polish economy.",
        "While discussing monetary policy, the Council members were of the opinion that at the current meeting interest rates should be kept unchanged and the purchases of securities as part of the structural open market operations should be continued.",
        "The majority of the Council members judged that if economic recovery progressed in 2021 and price growth in the medium term was in line with the inflation target, it would also be advisable to keep interest rates unchanged in the subsequent quarters.",
        "In their opinion, the tightening of monetary conditions in response to a temporary rise in inflation, caused largely by negative supply shocks that remains beyond the direct influence of monetary policy, would not limit price growth in 2021, while translating into a slower economic recovery after the pandemic-related slump.",
        "At the same time, in the opinion of these Council members, if the economic conditions and outlook were to deteriorate significantly, e.g.",
        "due to a new surge in the pandemic, further monetary policy easing might be justified, including by a reduction in the interest rates.",
        "Certain Council members argued that should a sharp rise in inflationary pressure appear in the coming quarters, it might be advisable to consider raising NBP interest rates in the second half of 2021.",
        "At the same time, the majority of the Council members emphasised that the experience of other central banks pointed to a strong negative economic impact of tightening monetary policy too quickly.",
        "It was observed that NBP’s monetary policy mitigated the negative economic impact of the pandemic, supported economic activity and stabilised inflation at the level consistent with NBP’s inflation target in the medium term.",
        "Due to its positive impact on the financial situation of debtors, it was also conducive to the strengthening of financial system stability.",
        "The Council rejected the motion to raise the required reserve ratio to 3.5% as well as the motion to reduce the remuneration of the required reserve funds from the level of the reference rate (currently 0.1%) to 0.01%.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 0.10%, the lombard rate at 0.50%, the deposit rate at 0.00%, the rediscount rate at 0.11%, and the discount rate at 0.12%.",
        "At the Council meeting, it was observed that the global economy was continuing to recover.",
        "In Q3 2021 GDP growth in the euro area had accelerated in quarterly terms, while latest data showed a decrease in unemployment to the levels observed before the pandemic.",
        "In the United States quarterly GDP growth in Q3 had slowed down, whereas in October growth in employment had accelerated which amidst a further improvement in the labour market situation led to increased wage dynamics.",
        "It was judged that while rising demand constituted a factor supporting global GDP growth, economic activity was under the negative impact of persisting supply-side constraints in some markets as well as high commodity prices.",
        "At the same time, in certain economies, including the euro area, re-escalation of the pandemic and tightening of pandemic restrictions were important risk factors, yet it was not obvious how dangerous the new variant of the coronavirus – Omicron – would be.",
        "The Council members observed, however, that recent experience pointed to diminishing impact of consecutive pandemic waves on economic conditions, and that according to current forecasts global GDP growth in 2022 would remain relatively robust, though lower than in 2021.",
        "It was noted that commodity prices in the global markets continued to be substantially higher than a year ago, which applied especially to natural gas, oil and coal, as well as to some agricultural commodities.",
        "It was highlighted that despite some decrease in oil prices amid deterioration of sentiment in the financial markets and a rise in risk aversion after the first news on Omicron, average oil price in November was over 80 per cent higher than a year ago, coal was over two-and-a-half times more expensive, and natural gas over five times more expensive.",
        "Some Council members emphasised that an increase in energy commodity prices was caused, on the one hand, by demand factors, and, on the other hand, by the OPEC+ policy concerning the volume of oil production and by the Russia’s policy concerning gas exports.",
        "At the same time, in Europe, apart from the rapid and very strong increase in gas prices, another factor boosting energy prices was a very sharp rise in prices of CO2 emission allowances related to the climate policy of the EU.",
        "The Council members underlined that high commodity prices together with prolonged disruptions in the functioning of global supply chains and still high international shipping costs, contributed to a marked rise in inflation globally, which was supported also by further recovery in demand.",
        "As a result, in many economies, including the euro area and the United States, inflation was reaching highest levels in decades.",
        "It was also stressed that core inflation was increasing as well, while inflation forecasts for the coming quarters were revised up, which pointed to the risk of longer than previously judged impact of the pandemic shock on inflationary processes, which in Europe was additionally exacerbated by strong negative effects of Russia’s supply policy in the gas market.",
        "It was underscored that also very high PPI indicators were a sign of the global nature of the current inflation increase.",
        "In this regard, it was highlighted that, in particular, PPI inflation in the euro area in October stood at close to 22%.",
        "Moreover, it was pointed out that in 20 EU countries PPI inflation was higher than in Poland, including in Ireland where it was nearly 90%, in Denmark where it was close to 40% and in Belgium and Spain where it was above 30%.",
        "It was indicated that globally rising inflation made some central banks withdraw monetary accommodation, although, it was stressed that monetary policy decisions of monetary authorities were being adjusted to conditions prevailing in particular economies, which meant that certain central banks were continuing to conduct expansive monetary policy.",
        "With this regard, it was underlined that the ECB was keeping negative interest rates and was still conducting big scale asset purchases, whereas the US Federal Reserve was keeping interest rates close to zero while signalling the possibility of announcing in December a more rapid deceleration of asset purchases, which together with an increase in the risk aversion had led to an appreciation pressure on the US dollar in global markets.",
        "In turn, the central banks of Central-Eastern Europe as well as in certain advanced economies have been increasing interest rates.",
        "While analysing the situation in the Polish economy, the Council members drew attention to the fact that despite the next wave of infections, economic conditions remained very robust.",
        "This was reflected in the preliminary estimates of GDP, according to which annual GDP growth in 2021 Q3 stood at 5.3%, therefore had turned out to be higher than expected.",
        "It was emphasized that in Q3 investment had accelerated significantly and its growth had increased to 9.3%.",
        "Moreover, it was indicated that both data on industrial production, retail sales and construction and assembly output for October 2021, as well as high frequency data and business sentiment indicators for November pointed to a solid increase in economic activity also in 2021 Q4.",
        "It was stressed that the situation in the labour market likewise continued to improve, as indicated by rising employment, decreasing unemployment and a marked increase in average wages.",
        "This, in turn, supported consumption.",
        "It was judged that in the coming quarters economic situation was to remain favourable, however, subject to uncertainty stemming from the course of the pandemic and its impact on economic conditions, as well as the persistence of supply-side constraints and high energy commodity prices, which constituted a negative supply shock for the economy.",
        "At the meeting, it was pointed out that according to the Statistics Poland flash estimate, inflation in Poland had risen to 7.7% y/y in November 2021, and increased by 1.0% in monthly terms.",
        "It was underlined that growth of energy prices, including fuels, but also of food prices accelerated further.",
        "Growth in prices of other goods had most likely also increased, especially of those, whose production and distribution process was subject to strains in the global supply chains and disruptions in shipping.",
        "At the same time, it was noted that the price growth of services had most likely decreased slightly.",
        "The Council members highlighted that heightened inflation was still mainly the result of the impact of external factors beyond the control of domestic monetary policy, such as higher than a year ago prices of energy and agricultural commodities in global markets, earlier increases in electricity prices and in waste disposal charges, as well as rising prices of goods, which were subject to global pandemic disruptions.",
        "At the same time, the Council members judged that the ongoing economic recovery, including robust demand stimulated by rising household income, was also adding to the price growth.",
        "In this regard, certain Council members pointed to an increase in core inflation indices.",
        "These Council members also drew attention to the rise in inflation expectations of households in the recent period.",
        "At the same time, the Council members pointed out that the increase of the NBP interest rates had been acting towards curbing inflation expectations.",
        "Certain Council members stressed that available data indicated a pass-through of the recent NBP interest rate increases into a rise of interest rates on loans, whereas the impact on interest rates on deposits was weaker so far.",
        "Certain Council members also underlined the importance of the exchange rate channel in the monetary transmission mechanism.",
        "When analysing the inflation outlook, the Council members pointed out that in 2022 the annual price growth of consumption goods and services would remain at an elevated level, mainly as a result of a further rise in prices of gas, electricity, heat energy and solid fuels, therefore as a result of negative supply shocks, which were independent from the domestic monetary policy.",
        "It was underlined that uncertainty regarding the impact of regulatory factors on inflation persisted, including regarding the decision of the President of the ERO on tariffs on electric energy, natural gas and heat energy in 2022.",
        "It was emphasised that in current circumstances a rise in energy prices and other costs would gradually translate into prices of other goods and services in the CPI basket.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that the government had decided to introduce the so-called Anti inflationary Shield that would include a reduction in some tax rates, which would curb inflation during the time when the lowered rates would apply.",
        "It was judged that in a longer perspective, price growth would decrease, which would be supported by expected fading of some global shocks currently boosting inflation, as well as by the increase in the NBP interest rates.",
        "The Council members concluded, however, that amidst expected continuation of economic recovery and favourable labour market conditions – despite the previous NBP interest rates increases – there persisted a risk of inflation running above the NBP inflation target in the monetary policy transmission horizon.",
        "The Council members recognised that, in order to lower inflation to the NBP target in the medium term, the NBP interest rates should be raised again.",
        "The increase of the NBP interest rates would also curb inflation expectations.",
        "The Council decided to raise the NBP reference rate by 0.50 percentage points, i.e.",
        "to 1.75% and to set the remaining NBP interest rates at the following levels: the lombard rate at 2.25%, the deposit rate at 1.25%, the rediscount rate at 1.80%, and the discount rate at 1.85%.",
        "The Council members pointed out that decisions of the Council in the coming months would continue to be aimed at reducing inflation to a level consistent with the NBP inflation target in the medium term, while taking into account economic conditions, so as to ensure medium-term price stability and at the same time support sustainable economic growth after the global pandemic shock.",
        "The Council’s assessment regarding the total scale of monetary tightening necessary for achieving these goals would consider incoming information on perspectives for inflation and economic growth, including situation in the labour market.",
        "Certain Council members expressed an opinion that ongoing significant uncertainty remained an important factors to be accounted for in monetary policy decisions.",
        "At the Council meeting it was pointed out that the recovery in global economic activity was continuing, although in some economies it had probably slowed down somewhat in 2021 Q3.",
        "It was underlined that so far global industry had been relatively resistant to the effects of the supply-side disruptions, although in some countries the lack of sub-components was translating into a deterioration in sentiment in that sector.",
        "Attention was also drawn to the positive signals regarding economic activity in the euro area.",
        "In particular, despite the growth in the number of COVID-19 infections, business conditions in the services sector in the euro area remained relatively favourable.",
        "At the same time, it was underlined that despite supply-side disruptions, a good situation also continued in the euro area industry, where output had exceeded the pre-pandemic level.",
        "It was also pointed out that global commodity prices had significantly risen in the recent period and were substantially higher than a year earlier.",
        "Attention was drawn to the fact that following some stabilisation, oil prices had once again begun to increase in recent weeks.",
        "Moreover, in the recent period natural gas prices had risen sharply in Europe, reaching a level several times higher than a year earlier.",
        "Prices of CO2 emission allowances also continued to rise.",
        "It was pointed out that, as a result, electricity prices had also increased in Europe.",
        "It was also underlined that in recent months the global prices of some agricultural commodities, in particular wheat, had also risen.",
        "It was pointed out that in many economies, commodity price growth – along with the supply side constraints in certain markets and sharp increase in international transport prices – had led to a significant rise in both PPI and CPI inflation in recent months.",
        "At the same time, it was judged that the impact of these factors on global inflation might last longer than had been hitherto thought.",
        "It was underlined that despite the rise in inflation, the major central banks were keeping interest rates low and conducting asset purchases.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that these banks had somewhat modified their communication and were currently indicating that the heightened level of inflation might persist longer than had previously been thought.",
        "Therefore, the expected horizon for maintaining highly expansionary monetary policy by these banks had been shortened.",
        "In September, the European Central Bank announced a slight reduction in the pace of purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme, and the Federal Reserve signalled that it would begin tapering its net asset purchases already this year.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that central banks in Central and Eastern Europe and in certain developed economies had raised interest rates in the recent period.",
        "When assessing the situation in the Polish economy, the Council members drew attention to the ongoing recovery in economic activity.",
        "It was underlined that in August industrial output growth had accelerated, exceeding the level determined by the pre pandemic trend.",
        "Attention was also drawn to the acceleration in retail sales growth as well as construction and assembly output in August.",
        "The Council members judged that in 2021 Q3, GDP growth was most likely higher than that indicated by the NBP July projection.",
        "It was also underlined that the economic recovery – along with the effects of the disbursement of funds under the anti-crisis shields – was having a very favourable impact on the financial situation of enterprises, which in many sectors had reported record profits.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that despite continued good economic conditions, in the recent period business sentiment in the industrial sector had deteriorated somewhat, which was related to the supply-side constraints occurring in certain markets.",
        "Certain Council members also pointed out that the current account balance had recently decreased to a negative level.",
        "At the same time, it was judged that in the coming quarters the favourable economic situation was likely to continue.",
        "Although the autumn wave of the epidemic continued to be an uncertainty factor, its impact on the economy should be limited due to the effects of the vaccinations and the adaptation of many firms and households to operating in epidemic conditions.",
        "It was also pointed out that an additional factor of uncertainty for the economic outlook in Poland was the impact of rising commodity prices on the global economic conditions.",
        "It was also pointed out that although average employment in the enterprise sector was still slightly lower than before the pandemic, the labour market situation was improving.",
        "The good situation of employees on the labour market was evidenced by unemployment staying low despite the gradual winding down of the programmes subsidising wages under the anti-crisis shields.",
        "It was underlined that this favourable situation was also reflected in solid wage growth in the enterprise sector.",
        "It was also pointed out that nominal wages were growing much faster than prices, and at the same time they were accompanied by fast growth in labour productivity.",
        "The majority of the Council members judged that wage growth was being driven mainly by the growth in productivity, and that inflation was not generating excessive wage pressure.",
        "In turn, in the opinion of certain Council members, heightened inflation might increase wage demands of various occupational groups, translating into growing wage pressures in the coming quarters.",
        "At the meeting it was pointed out that according to the Statistics Poland flash estimate, inflation in Poland rose to 5.8% y/y in September 2021, and stood at 0.6% in monthly terms.",
        "The majority of the Council members underlined that heightened inflation was mainly the result of the impact of factors beyond the control of domestic monetary policy, including higher global prices of energy and agricultural commodities than a year earlier, previous hikes in electricity prices and waste disposal charges, as well as global disruptions in transport and the functioning of supply chains.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that the ongoing economic recovery, including rising household income, had also added to the price growth.",
        "In the opinion of the majority of the Council members, demand-side factors alone were not causing an excessive increase in price growth.",
        "Certain Council members did not share this opinion, instead pointing to the growing core inflation indicators.",
        "Certain Council members also pointed to the higher level of inflation expectations than in previous years.",
        "They also underlined the importance of exchange rate channel in the monetary transmission mechanism.",
        "The Council members judged that although some supply-side factors currently fuelling inflation would fade in 2022, the growth in commodity prices observed in recent months, including the prices of energy and agricultural commodities, might continue to boost price growth in the coming quarters.",
        "In particular, attention was drawn to the likely significant increases in electricity and gas prices for households and enterprises, alongside the higher path of food prices than expected earlier.",
        "It was also underlined that the global shocks had contributed to high growth in producer prices, which might translate into further increases in prices of consumer goods, particularly amid continued growth in consumer income.",
        "In this context, it was concluded that amidst probable further recovery in economic activity and favourable labour market conditions, inflation might persist at an elevated level longer than hitherto expected.",
        "In particular, it was judged that with the continued favourable economic situation, inflation – despite some decline expected in 2022 – would most likely run above the NBP July projection in the coming quarters and that in this horizon it would not return by itself to the band for deviations from the NBP inflation target.",
        "It was assessed that such a situation would generate a risk of price growth remaining above the inflation target in the medium term.",
        "The Council members recognised that, in order to decrease inflation to the NBP target in the medium term, NBP interest rates should be raised.",
        "Therefore, the Council passed the motion to raise the reference rate by 0.4 percentage points, i.e.",
        "to 0.50% and set the remaining NBP interest rates at the following levels: the lombard rate at 1.00%, the deposit rate at 0.00%, the rediscount rate at 0.51%, and the discount rate at 0.52%.",
        "At the same time, the Council decided to increase the required reserve ratio from 0.5% to 2.0%.",
        "The Council members underlined that the interest rate increase would reduce the risk of inflation remaining elevated in the medium term.",
        "They also underlined that, due to the external causes of the heightened inflation, in the short term inflation would continue to be elevated.",
        "At the same time, the Council members stated that future monetary policy decisions would depend on the assessment of incoming information on the economic situation, including the outlook for economic conditions and for inflation.",
        "The Council members also judged that monetary policy decisions must support a return of inflation to the target in the medium term, yet they should also aim to consolidate the economic recovery and create the conditions for further sustainable growth of the Polish economy.",
        "During the discussion the Council members pointed out that – as COVID19 infections increased and sanitary restrictions were tightened again – the global recovery had slowed down in 2020 Q4.",
        "In particular, attention was drawn to the fact that according to preliminary data, GDP in the euro area had fallen in that period, although less than in 2020 Q2, and in January 2021, faced with the risk of another wave of infections, some European countries had extended or tightened the existing pandemic restrictions.",
        "It was pointed out that the extension or tightening of the restrictions had adversely affected the sentiment of economic agents and might delay and reduce the scale of the expected economic recovery in the external environment of the Polish economy.",
        "At the same time, it was underlined that although a downturn in the services sector continued, the situation in industry and international trade was relatively good.",
        "The Council members stressed that inflation in the global economy remained low.",
        "At the same time, certain Council members observed that in January 2021 there had been a marked increase in inflation in Germany.",
        "It was pointed out that this had largely resulted from the expiry of the temporary cuts in VAT rates in that country.",
        "In the context of price developments in the external environment of the Polish economy, attention was drawn to the rise in global oil prices in recent months.",
        "The increase in these prices was driven by an improvement in sentiment due to the launch of the vaccination programmes and the announcement of an additional stimulus package for the US economy, which had boosted expectations regarding a rebound in global economic activity at the beginning of 2021.",
        "Moreover, it was emphasised that countries associated in OPEC+ were continuing the policy of limiting oil production, counteracting the excessive growth in supply of this commodity, which also translated into higher prices.",
        "It was pointed out that in the long term the global supply of oil might be affected, on the one hand, by the likely change in climate policy in the United States, and on the other hand, by the possible easing or lifting sanctions imposed on certain oil producers.",
        "The Council members underlined that the major central banks were continuing their highly expansionary monetary policy, including maintaining low interest rates and purchasing assets on a large scale.",
        "In particular, the Council members drew attention to the fact that the Federal Reserve of the United States announced it would conduct an accommodative monetary policy until an improvement in activity was seen in the data, and not only in the forecasts.",
        "Furthermore, the Fed had been clearly indicating that it would aim for inflation to exceed its inflation target for some time in the future.",
        "The European Central Bank also stressed its commitment to maintain all its current measures, including conducting asset purchases on a large scale and maintaining negative interest rates in subsequent years.",
        "When referring to the Polish economy, it was pointed out that the rise in COVID-19 infections and the tightening of the epidemic restrictions in 2020 Q4 had had a negative impact on economic activity in this period, which was particularly noticeable in part of the services sector.",
        "The Council members indicated that taking into account the preliminary estimate of GDP for 2020 and assuming no revision of GDP data for 2020 Q1-Q3, it could be estimated that in 2020 Q4 there had been another fall in GDP, although its scale was significantly smaller than in 2020 Q2.",
        "It was pointed out that the decline in activity had been driven by a fall in consumption and investment.",
        "The Council members drew attention to the still lower level of average employment in the enterprise sector than a year earlier, and a rise in the annual growth in average wages in this sector.",
        "At the same time, some Council members pointed out that in December there had been an increase in growth in construction and assembly output and industrial output, including in the export sectors.",
        "The Council members judged that according to the current forecasts following the fall in GDP in 2020, in 2021 there would be a recovery in economic activity, which might even be somewhat stronger than earlier estimated.",
        "Alongside that, it was pointed out that data from the beginning of the year did not suggest that the recovery had already begun, although the situation in individual sectors varied.",
        "The Council members also underlined that the scale and timing of the recovery would depend, above all, on the epidemic situation and the related restrictions.",
        "The further course of the pandemic and its impact on the economic situation in Poland and abroad would remain the key sources of uncertainty for the economic outlook in Poland, while it would take time to see the impact of the vaccination process on the pandemic and the economy.",
        "At the same time, it was observed that the economic policy measures taken so far, including NBP’s monetary policy easing, and in the longer term also funds from the European Union, would continue to have a positive impact on the economic situation.",
        "When discussing price developments, the Council members pointed out that data on inflation in December were evidence that consumer price growth at the end of 2020 was running at a level consistent with the NBP’s inflation target, and was close to 2.5%.",
        "Some Council members judged that according to current forecasts, in 2021 inflation would rise somewhat compared to December, but despite this it would remain within the band of deviations from the inflation target.",
        "These Council members underlined that the forecast increase in annual CPI would be due to the rise in global oil prices and the base effects in fuel prices.",
        "Moreover, as in 2020, inflation would be boosted by regulatory factors, above all by higher electricity prices and waste disposal charges, which are negative supply shocks.",
        "These Council members pointed out that regulatory factors would be responsible for over 1 percentage point of inflation.",
        "At the same time, the further development of global oil prices remained a risk factor for inflation; however, it was a factor beyond the control of monetary policy.",
        "Certain Council members underlined that due to the significance of oil for price developments in the economy, their pass-through to the remaining consumer prices should be carefully observed.",
        "Moreover, these Council members pointed out that inflation might be boosted by the materialisation of pent-up demand and the launch of large infrastructure investments.",
        "Certain Council members the risk of an increase in inflation was also evidenced by a rise in producer prices.",
        "When assessing the outlook for economic activity and inflation in Poland in the coming quarters, the Council members drew attention to the significance of the zloty exchange rate.",
        "It was underlined that adjustment of the exchange rate was one of the basic mechanisms acting as a shock absorber for the domestic economy.",
        "The majority of the Council members reiterated that the lack of a visible and more durable zloty exchange rate adjustment might reduce the pace of the economic recovery.",
        "These Council members judged that the interventions in the foreign exchange market conducted since December 2020 – aimed at diminishing pressure on the appreciation of the zloty due to further monetary policy easing by the major central banks – had lowered the risk of a procyclical strengthening of the zloty and enhanced the impact of NBP’s monetary policy easing on the economy.",
        "The majority of the Council members also underlined that due to the relatively high share of domestic value added in exports compared to other countries of the region, the depreciation of the zloty would clearly improve the economic situation.",
        "It was observed that Polish exports were less import-intensive than in other economies of Central and Eastern Europe and as a result they were more vulnerable to exchange rate fluctuations.",
        "Furthermore, the position of Poland in the structure of the global supply chains makes the impact of the exchange rate significant for the competitiveness of the country’s producers.",
        "These Council members pointed out that the sharp increase in the role of services in Poland’s foreign trade had a positive effect on the exchange rate pass-through on GDP growth.",
        "Certain Council members expressed the opinion that while the impact of a zloty depreciation on exports growth was positive, currently it was weaker than in the past.",
        "The Council members underlined that NBP’s monetary policy easing in 2020 had been accompanied by a decline in bond yields and the full pass-through of cuts in NBP interest rates to interest rates on loans to households and enterprises.",
        "In effect, households and enterprises had received significant support, both through measures related to the anti-crisis shields and through a reduction in loan instalments.",
        "Some Council members also pointed out that the significant financial resources received by many firms in the form of state aid had driven a strong rise in their deposits, which along with uncertainty about the future economic conditions, had reduced demand for corporate loans.",
        "At the same time, certain Council members drew attention to the fact that amid keeping interest rates low – which was accompanied by a decrease in interest rates on deposits – a marked increase in the prices of other assets, including real estate prices, was noticeable.",
        "While discussing monetary policy, the Council members were of the opinion that at the present meeting interest rates should be kept unchanged and the remaining NBP’s measures should be continued.",
        "The majority of the Council members judged that if economic recovery progressed in 2021 and price growth was in line with the inflation target, it would also be advisable to keep interest rates unchanged in the subsequent quarters.",
        "At the same time, in the opinion of these Council members, if the economic conditions and outlook were to deteriorate significantly, e.g.",
        "due to a new surge in the pandemic, further monetary policy easing might be justified, including by a reduction in the interest rate.",
        "Certain Council members believed that, should further easing of monetary conditions be necessary, a further cut in NBP interest rates would not be advisable and instead additional measures aimed at supporting corporate lending should be implemented.",
        "Certain Council members argued that should a sharp rise in inflationary pressure appear in the coming quarters, it might be advisable to consider raising NBP interest rates in the second half of 2021.",
        "It was observed that NBP’s monetary policy mitigated the negative impact of the pandemic, supported economic activity and stabilised inflation at a level consistent with NBP's medium-term inflation target.",
        "Due to its positive impact on the financial situation of debtors, it was also conducive to the strengthening of financial system stability.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 0.10%, the lombard rate at 0.50%, the deposit rate at 0.00%, the rediscount rate at 0.11%, and the discount rate at 0.12%."

        "At the same time, it was underlined that data for the recent period indicated that along with the gradual easing of the containment measures, sentiment in many economies had improved and economic activity had started to recover.",
        "It was judged that the economic activity rebound – after a sharp fall – stemmed partly from resumption of previously suspended business activity and from the realisation of deferred consumer demand.",
        "It was underlined that economic activity growth would also be supported by the fiscal measures introduced in many economies as well as the accompanying easing of monetary policy, including the interest rate cuts and asset purchases.",
        "It was noted that these measures would mitigate the impact of the pandemic on the financial situation of companies and, as a result, on the situation in the labour market.",
        "Referring to the global economic outlook, it was pointed out that current forecasts indicated a further improvement in economic conditions in the second half of 2020.",
        "The majority of Council members judged that economic activity growth in the coming months might be slower than immediately after lifting of the containment measures.",
        "They drew attention to the fact that forecasts predicted only a gradual return to the prepandemic activity level.",
        "Council members also underlined that increased uncertainty persisted regarding the pace and robustness of the recovery in the global economic conditions in the coming quarters.",
        "The most important factors of uncertainty included the further development of the epidemic situation around the world, as well as the scale of adjustment of the enterprise sector and labour market to the potential termination of the economic stimulus programmes.",
        "At the same time it was emphasised that so far the major central banks had not signalled the possibility of reducing the scale of monetary expansion and financial market participants were not expecting a tightening of monetary policy for many quarters.",
        "The recent weakening of corporate and household pessimism was accompanied in recent weeks by some improvement in global financial markets sentiment.",
        "At the same time, the prices of some commodities rose, remaining, however, at significantly lower levels than at the beginning of the year.",
        "In particular, despite a slight increase, oil prices remained low, as a result of – according to certain Council members – the decline in demand for this commodity following the slump in global economic activity as well as the announced termination of cooperation on limiting oil production between Russia and Saudi Arabia.",
        "Council members emphasised that low commodity prices, along with decrease in economic activity, were contributing to inflation remaining at low levels in many countries, including Poland’s major trading partners.",
        "In Poland, incoming information suggests that following an earlier sharp deterioration of economic situation, in the recent period there had been a gradual improvement in sentiment and a recovery in economic activity.",
        "It was pointed out that in May – as some of the pandemic-related restrictions were lifted – a sharp month-overmonth rise was recorded in retail sales and industrial output.",
        "At the same time, the majority of Council members observed that activity remained lower than a year ago and assessed that the rate of recovery might slow down in the coming months.",
        "It was also underlined that the still weakened economic activity was having a negative impact on the labour market situation, which was indicated by a further, although limited, fall in employment and a marked decline in wage growth in enterprises.",
        "Council members judged that in the coming months economic activity could be expected to recover further.",
        "It was pointed out that such a scenario was also indicated by the results of NBP’s July projection.",
        "The opinion was expressed that domestic activity would be supported by an improvement in the economic situation in the external environment of the Polish economy and by economic policy measures, including the easing of NBP’s monetary policy.",
        "It was judged that economic growth in 2020 Q3 might be boosted by increased consumption expenditure due to a significant increase in the number of consumers spending their vacation in Poland.",
        "At the same time, the majority of Council members expressed the opinion that, as indicated by NBP’s July projection, the improvement in the economic situation in the coming quarters would only be gradual.",
        "These Council members pointed out that the scale of the expected recovery may be limited by uncertainty about the consequences of the pandemic, lower incomes and weaker sentiment than in previous years, as well as the lack of a significant adjustment of the zloty exchange rate to the global shock caused by the pandemic and NBP’s monetary policy easing.",
        "Certain Council members were of the opinion that economic growth might be slower than indicated by the July projection.",
        "According to these Council members, GDP growth would be limited by the likely increase in precautionary savings amid an expected decline in household income growth and by still weakened investment demand.",
        "In turn, certain Council members judged that the economic recovery might proceed faster than assumed in the projection due to the positive impact on GDP of large infrastructure projects.",
        "According to the Statistics Poland (GUS) flash estimate, CPI inflation in Poland stood in June at 3.3% y/y.",
        "The majority of Council members judged that inflation growth in June was temporary and probably resulted from the adjustment of service prices to an increased demand – boosted by the realisation of purchases that had been deferred while the pandemic-related restrictions were in force – as well as the introduction by some service providers of a so-called sanitation charge.",
        "These members expressed the opinion that, as indicated by NBP’s July projection, in the coming months price growth would most likely decline.",
        "The significantly lower wage growth than in previous years, the expected growth in the unemployment rate, intensifying price competition between companies amid weakened demand, and the low inflation forecast abroad would contribute to lower inflation.",
        "According to these Council members, consumers and enterprises inflation expectations, which had recently declined, also pointed to a likely decrease in inflation later in the year.",
        "However, certain Council members judged that inflation might be higher than indicated in NBP’s July projection.",
        "These Council members drew attention to the recent elevated readings of inflation excluding food and energy prices, judging that core inflation would also remain relatively high in the coming months.",
        "They pointed out that the realisation of purchases deferred while the pandemic restrictions were in force, as well as the significant increase in administered prices and – potentially – electricity prices, would contribute to faster price growth.",
        "In the opinion of these Council members, inflation might additionally be increased by higher food prices due to a likely agricultural drought and – in the long term – by higher prices of intermediate goods the possible deglobalisation.",
        "Moreover, these Council members judged that despite a slight decline, inflation expectations of consumers and enterprises remained elevated.",
        "The Council members pointed out that NBP’s measures taken so far had contributed to an easing of the financing conditions in Poland.",
        "In particular it was emphasised that interest rate cuts had translated into lower expenses of indebted companies and households, supporting their budgets.",
        "It was also judged that the NBP interest rate cuts were reflected in lower yields on government bonds.",
        "It was underlined that this effect was boosted by the asset purchase programmes conducted by NBP.",
        "However, certain Council members emphasised that in response to the reduction in NBP interest rates, commercial banks had also cut interest rates on deposits.",
        "In the opinion of these Council members, cutting interest rates on bank deposits amid a rise in savings of some households due to the pandemic led to a significant increase in current deposits at the expense of term deposits and to depositors seeking higher-risk investment.",
        "Moreover, certain Council members underlined that the monetary policy easing had contributed to a reduction in short-term interest rates to a greater extent than long-term rates.",
        "The majority of Council members judged that due to their positive impact on the financial situation of indebted companies and households, the interest rate cuts would support the stability of the banking sector.",
        "However, certain Council members emphasised that they might lead to a deterioration in banks’ interest income.",
        "These Council members also drew attention to the fact that banks might attempt to improve their financial results by increasing fees and commissions.",
        "The Council members were of the opinion that following the earlier significant interest rate cuts and the launch of asset purchase programmes, the present meeting should keep interest rates unchanged and continue to pursue NBP’s remaining measures.",
        "It was pointed out that NBP’s monetary policy easing mitigated the negative economic effects of the pandemic, limiting the scale of the decline in economic activity and supporting the income of households and enterprises.",
        "As a result, NBP’s monetary policy contributes to mitigating the fall in employment and limiting the deterioration of the financial situation of enterprises, supporting a quicker economic recovery after the pandemic ends.",
        "NBP’s measures reduce the risk of inflation falling below the NBP inflation target in the medium term and through the positive impact on the financial situation of borrowers, they contribute to the strengthening of the stability of the financial system.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 0.10%, the lombard rate at 0.50%, the deposit rate at 0.00%, the rediscount rate at 0.11%, and the discount rate at 0.12%.",
        "During the meeting, attention was drawn to the deteriorating economic climate in the immediate environment of the Polish economy.",
        "In the euro area, as the recession in the industrial sector unfolds, the annual GDP growth rate decreased in 2019 Q4.",
        "Economic conditions remained weak, in particular, in the major countries of this economy: in Germany quarterly GDP growth stood at zero, and in France and Italy it was negative.",
        "In the United States, GDP growth remained stable in 2019 Q4, despite weaker activity in industry.",
        "However, at the beginning of 2020 the economic climate in the United States deteriorated slightly.",
        "Attention was drawn to a marked slowdown in economic activity in China at the beginning of 2020.",
        "The Council members assessed that due to the spread of coronavirus, uncertainty about the global economic outlook had risen substantially in the recent period.",
        "In China, production had been halted in certain companies, causing disruption in some of the global value chains, and a number of global firms had suspended production.",
        "At the same time, many countries had seen a drop in demand for tourism and transportation services.",
        "Against this background, global growth forecasts had been revised downwards, and sentiment in the global financial markets had slumped.",
        "There had been a sharp fall in equity prices, and a decline in government bond yields.",
        "The Council members pointed out the sharp fall in the prices of oil and liquified natural gas.",
        "At the same time, it was underlined that prices of many food commodities were persisting at a high level.",
        "As a result, inflation in the global economy, including the external environment of the Polish economy, had risen in the past few months.",
        "Due to the deteriorating economic outlook, some central banks had cut their interest rates or announced an easing of the monetary policy stance.",
        "In particular, interest rates had been cut by the US Federal Reserve (Fed).",
        "It was emphasised that the European Central Bank (ECB) was keeping the deposit rate below zero while conducting asset purchases and signalling the maintenance of loose monetary policy in the coming quarters.",
        "The Council members stressed the fact that the financial markets were expecting the ECB to loosen monetary policy further and the Fed to continue cutting interest rates.",
        "Certain Council members were of the opinion that the potential for counteracting the economic effects of coronavirus by loosening monetary policy was limited.",
        "In their view, this resulted in part from the supply-side nature of the shock and high economic uncertainty pertaining to it.",
        "These Council members also pointed out the restricted room for further interest rate cuts in some of the economies.",
        "In contrast, other Council members argued that interest rate cuts in many countries would limit a further deterioration in sentiment and mitigate the effects of the economic losses, thus helping to support the economy in the longer run.",
        "The Council members judged that economic conditions in Poland remained good, despite slowing economic growth.",
        "In 2019 Q4, real GDP growth stood at 3.2% y/y.",
        "GDP growth was supported by steady consumption growth, albeit slightly slower than in previous quarters, fuelled by favourable labour market conditions, strong consumer confidence and social benefit payments.",
        "It was pointed out that investment continued to grow, and the contribution of net exports to GDP growth was positive.",
        "Certain Council members highlighted the drop in demand growth below its long-term average.",
        "Some Council members assessed that the data incoming at the beginning of 2020 suggested potentially slower growth in 2020 Q1 than in the preceding years.",
        "This was indicated by moderate industrial output growth, slower retail sales growth and somewhat weaker – although still upbeat – household sentiment.",
        "However, these Council members also stressed that construction and assembly output picked up in January, which might have been partially due to the favourable weather conditions in that month.",
        "While discussing current data, certain Council members pointed out the persistence of the PMI index below 50 points and a deterioration in some of the other confidence indicators.",
        "It was observed that conditions in the labour market remained favourable, even though employment growth in enterprises had slowed down somewhat.",
        "On the other hand, wage growth in the corporate sector had risen slightly in January 2020 (possibly in part due to the increased minimum wage), while staying close to the level observed in the past two years.",
        "Certain Council members pointed out that the slight increase in the registered unemployment rate in recent months might signal worse prospects for the labour market.",
        "According to preliminary Statistics Poland (GUS) data, in January 2020 inflation exceeded the upper limit of deviations from the NBP inflation target.",
        "The majority of Council members underlined that the rise in inflation above the NBP target level had been driven by regulatory and supply-side factors that remained beyond the influence of the domestic monetary policy.",
        "These factors comprised, in particular, higher electricity and fuel prices, the increase in waste disposal charges and excise tax on alcoholic beverages and tobacco products as well as a further rise in the prices of unprocessed food, related to the spread of the African Swine Fever epidemic in many countries and to last year’s drought.",
        "It was emphasised that the upward pressure on prices was also the result of demand factors related to favourable financial situation of households, yet these alone were not the reason why the inflation target had been exceeded.",
        "It was pointed out that the growth in the prices of non-food products and market services, i.e.",
        "prices which were largely determined by demand and not by regulatory factors or supply shocks, had not exceeded 2.5% y/y.",
        "Certain Council members drew attention to the fact that some measures of business and consumer inflation expectations had risen recently.",
        "Yet the majority of the Council members shared the opinion that the increase was attributable to the adaptive nature of these expectations and the increase in current inflation.",
        "In this context, it was underlined that the medium-term inflation expectations of market analysts remained anchored at the level of the inflation target.",
        "Some Council members pointed out that higher inflation was not the result of excessive lending growth.",
        "These Council members emphasised that the total growth in lending to the non-financial sector had decreased in the past few months and remained slower than nominal GDP growth.",
        "They also drew attention to the slower consumer credit growth and the still moderate housing credit growth.",
        "In addition, they pointed out that corporate lending growth remained slow, which – in the opinion of certain Council members – might result from companies financing operations from sources other than bank credit.",
        "Certain Council members indicated that higher inflation contributed to lower real interest rates, which supported fast, in their assessment, lending and higher demand for riskier assets and real estate.",
        "On the other hand, some Council members underlined that lower real interest rates than in the past was a phenomenon typical for many of the world’s economies these days.",
        "These Council members also pointed out that the decrease in real interest rates resulted primarily from negative supply shocks, which curtailed households’ real income and their ability to service debt.",
        "Therefore, these shocks would have a hampering effect on lending in the economy.",
        "Hence, the situation was different than in a case when real interest rates decline due to price growth resulting from excessive demand in the economy.",
        "Discussing the results of the March projection, the Council members indicated that according to its central path, GDP growth in 2020 and 2021 would remain close to 3%.",
        "Economic growth was to be further supported mainly by consumption, although consumption growth would be slower than in previous years due to the expected weakening of wage growth and the decrease in total employment forecast for 2021.",
        "Simultaneously, it was pointed out that investment growth might slow down in the projection horizon due to weaker growth in the absorption of EU funds.",
        "It was also emphasised that export growth might be slower than in the previous years.",
        "The Council members were of the opinion that in these circumstances, GDP growth would probably remain below its long-term average in the subsequent quarters.",
        "Attention was drawn to the fact that risks to the forecast GDP growth in Poland were on the downside.",
        "The main source of risk was the further spread of the coronavirus, which might cause a sharper drop in economic activity growth in Poland’s immediate environment, and, as a result, a more pronounced weakening in export growth.",
        "At the same time, further expansion of the coronavirus might lead to a slump in business and consumer sentiment at home.",
        "The Council members pointed out that the central path of the March inflation projection indicated a possibility of inflation in 2020 running slightly above the upper limit of deviations from the inflation target due to the supply-side and regulatory factors.",
        "However, the majority of Council members stressed that as the influence of those factors faded, the anticipated GDP growth weakening materialised and the output gap narrowed, inflation would return close to the inflation target in 2021.",
        "Another factor with a dampening effect on inflation would be the recently observed decline in global oil prices.",
        "In this context it was noted that inflation returning close to the inflation target in 2021 was suggested not only by the central path of the March projection, but also by external forecasts.",
        "In turn, certain Council members emphasised that in line with the central path of the projection, in the coming quarters inflation would continue to exceed the inflation target, temporarily even exceeding the upper limit of deviations from the inflation target.",
        "These Council members observed that unit labour cost growth – which was high in their opinion – would exert upward pressure on inflation.",
        "It was also pointed out that the further development of energy and unprocessed food prices was subject to uncertainty.",
        "The interruptions of the global supply chains as a result of the spread of the coronavirus were also noted as possibly having an inflationary impact.",
        "The majority of Council members decided that the NBP interest rates should remain unchanged at the current meeting.",
        "In their opinion, the outlook for the domestic economy remained favourable, yet GDP growth in the coming quarters would be lower than in the previous years.",
        "At the same time, the Council assessed that recently uncertainty as to the scale and duration of the economic slowdown abroad and its impact on domestic economic activity had increased.",
        "The majority of the Council members underlined that although in the coming quarters the annual inflation rate might remain above the upper limit of deviations from the inflation target, it would be the result of the impact of supplyside and regulatory factors and would therefore remain beyond the direct influence of domestic monetary policy.",
        "In the opinion of these Council members, as the impact of those factors faded, and amid the anticipated slowdown in GDP growth, inflation would subside and return close to the inflation target over the monetary policy horizon.",
        "Such an assessment was supported by the results of the March inflation and GDP projection.",
        "The Council members pointed out that due to the increased uncertainty about the global growth outlook and the further development of the economic situation and inflation in Poland, uncertainty about the further development of the NBP interest rates had, however, increased recently.",
        "Certain Council members assessed that over the monetary policy horizon inflation might be higher than indicated by the current forecasts.",
        "They pointed out that such a risk was related to the possible persistence of some of the factors currently raising price growth.",
        "However, these Council members judged that the NBP interest rates should remain unchanged at the current meeting of the Council due to the increased uncertainty about the further economic situation around the world and its impact on the business climate and inflation in Poland.",
        "In turn, other Council members emphasised that recently the risk of a sharper and longer-lasting global economic slowdown had continued to increase, and at the same time further signs had appeared indicating the transmission of the weak global business conditions into economic growth in Poland.",
        "In this context, these Council members drew attention to the additional risks related to the spread of the coronavirus.",
        "At the same time, these Council members judged that in the medium term inflation would be in line with the NBP target.",
        "As a result, a view was maintained that it was justified to lower the NBP interest rates now and that – in the longer run – it might be justified to consider further cuts in interest rates or the introduction of unconventional monetary policy instruments.",
        "Certain Council members pointed out that the assessment regarding the possible justification of monetary policy easing going forward would be possible after more information had become available regarding the situation in the global and domestic economy.",
        "At the meeting, a motion to cut the basic NBP interest rates by 0.25 percentage points was submitted.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 1.50%, the lombard rate at 2.50%, the deposit rate at 0.50% and the rediscount rate at 1.75%.",
        "At the same time, many of the world’s central banks, of both developed and emerging economies, are cutting interest rates, are implementing or extending financial asset purchase programmes or pumping liquidity into the banking sector.",
        "The US Federal Reserve has cut interest rates, bringing them close to zero, restarted asset purchases and increased liquidity in the financial market.",
        "Due to the permanently negative interest rates, the European Central Bank has not cut interest rates, but it has eased monetary conditions by significantly increasing the scale of asset purchases and liquidity provision to banks.",
        "At the same time, many other central banks have eased monetary policy.",
        "The measures of central banks around the world – through providing liquidity to the economy and also reducing the costs of debt servicing – will reduce the negative economic effects of the pandemic.",
        "The majority of the Council members judged that the easing of monetary policy around the world would contribute to improving the financial situation and business sentiment.",
        "It was also pointed out that it would contribute to lower Treasury bonds yields, which would increase the fiscal space necessary to finance both the measures taken to combat the epidemic and stimulus packages offered.",
        "Certain Council members were of the opinion that the effectiveness of some of the measures taken by the central banks to support the economic conditions would be limited in a short period due to the supply-side character of the current shocks.",
        "In Poland, the economic conditions in the first months of 2020 had been relatively good, although data indicated a gradual slowdown in economic growth.",
        "However, the spread of the coronavirus had caused a deterioration in economic sentiment, and the restrictions on the activity of some sectors, including the service sector, will contribute to lower economic activity.",
        "The Council members pointed out that the coronavirus epidemic would constitute a drag on the demand for and supply of many services, and also – through falling incomes – it would reduce demand for a significant number of non-necessity goods.",
        "At the same time, the decline of foreign demand would also contribute to lower economic activity.",
        "The Council members also drew attention to the supply-side consequences of the spread of coronavirus, including the disruption of some of supply chains and the reduction in the number of employees due to the need for people to stay at home.",
        "The Council members also drew attention to the high level of uncertainty about the further development of economic conditions in Poland.",
        "It was underlined that the current forecasts suggested a sharp fall in GDP growth in the short term.",
        "It was judged that in the medium term an improvement in the economic conditions could be expected; however, economic activity growth would depend above all on the scale, extent and length of the pandemic.",
        "According to the Statistics Poland (GUS) data, in February 2020 inflation stood at 4.7% y/y.",
        "It was pointed out that in the coming months inflation would most likely decline significantly.",
        "This would be supported by the expected fall in the prices of many services, which would be most vulnerable to a fall in demand in the current economic conditions.",
        "At the same time it was judged that prices of durable goods could also be expected to decline.",
        "As a result, core inflation would also fall significantly.",
        "It was underlined that the sharp decline in global commodity prices, including oil prices, would be an additional significant factor causing a decline in price growth in the coming quarters.",
        "Taking this into account, the majority of Council members judged that in the recent period there was an increased likelihood of a faster decline in inflation in 2020 than assumed in the March projection and of inflation running below the NBP inflation target over the monetary policy horizon.",
        "Certain Council members pointed out that the current macroeconomic shocks were also of a supply-side nature, which could curb the decline of inflation, although these shocks can also reinforce pressure on necessity goods prices increases.",
        "The majority of the Council members judged that at the current meeting the NBP interest rates should be lowered.",
        "These Council members were of the opinion that the cut in the NBP interest rates would reduce instalments on loans with a variable interest rate taken out by enterprises and households.",
        "The reduction in debt servicing costs would therefore mitigate the losses of enterprises and households caused by production stoppages, lower incomes and lower demand for goods and services.",
        "At the same time, lower loan instalments would reduce costs for indebted households, including the selfemployed or persons working on the basis of civil law contracts, who are to a large extent exposed to the risk of loss of income.",
        "As a result, the monetary policy easing would also reduce the risk of insolvency of economic entities.",
        "These Council members pointed out that although the banks had announced the possibility of temporarily suspending loan repayments, this measure – which in itself would be desirable – would only mean the postponement of loan repayments.",
        "The majority of the Council members also underlined that the interest rate cuts would contribute to lower yields on Treasury bonds and the costs of public debt servicing, which would provide additional room for the necessary fiscal stimulus.",
        "Certain Council members judged that while at the current meeting interest rates should be cut, the scale of the NBP interest rate cuts should be small.",
        "These Council members were of the opinion that non-standard monetary policy measures could be a more effective instrument in counteracting the negative economic effects of the coronavirus epidemic at the moment.",
        "An opinion was also expressed that the possibility of using such instruments could be constrained by an excessive interest rates reduction.",
        "Certain Council members judged that the NBP interest rates should be kept unchanged at the current meeting.",
        "They argued that in the current conditions a cut in the NBP interest rates would have a limited impact on the real economy, because the sources of the economic shock are exogenous, and the barrier to lending was the currently low demand for credit and high level of uncertainty in the economy.",
        "The Council members judged that in order to limit the impact of liquidity shocks caused by the pandemic, it was also advisable to increase liquidity in the banking sector by NBP.",
        "This is why it was necessary to reduce the reserve requirement ratio (along with raising the remuneration rate for this reserve to the level of the reference rate) and to conduct repo operations to supply liquidity to the banking sector.",
        "It was also underlined that in the face of a significant reduction in liquidity in the Treasury securities market, it was necessary to launch purchases of Treasury securities in the secondary market as part of the structural open market operations.",
        "The aim of these operations will be to change the long-term liquidity structure in the banking sector and maintain liquidity in the secondary market of Treasury bonds.",
        "It was also underlined that the purchase of Treasury bonds in the secondary market would strengthen the impact of the NBP interest rate cuts on the economy, that is, it would strengthen the monetary transmission mechanism.",
        "The Council members judged that in order to reduce the risk of the impact of the current economic disruptions on the credit supply, it was justified for NBP to also offer bill discount credit, which would enable banks to refinance corporate loans, including those to small and medium-sized enterprises.",
        "However, it was also pointed out that the main tool supporting lending to small and medium-sized firms in the current conditions – namely significantly heightened uncertainty and heightened credit risk – should be, above all, the extension of the government loan guarantee scheme conducted by Bank Gospodarstwa Krajowego.",
        "The majority of the Council members judged that monetary conditions should be eased in order to mitigate the negative economic impact of the spread of the coronavirus.",
        "This will support economic recovery after the period of disruptions and will mitigate the risk of inflation running below the NBP inflation target in the medium term.",
        "At the meeting, a motion was submitted to cut the NBP reference rate by 0.5 percentage points, narrow the symmetrical corridor of standing facility rates to overall 1.0 percentage point around the reference rate, lower the rediscount rate to 1.05% and introduce the discount rate at the level of 1.1%.",
        "At the meeting a motion was submitted to lower the required reserve ratio from 3.5% to 0.5% as well as a motion to raise the remuneration of the required reserve from 0.5% to the level of the NBP reference rate.",
        "At the meeting a motion was also submitted to lower the required reserve ration from 3.5% to 0.25%.",
        "The motion did not pass.",
        "The Council set the NBP interest rates as follows: the reference rate at 1.00%, the lombard rate at 1.50%, the deposit rate at 0.50%, the rediscount rate at 1.05%, and the discount rate at 1.10%.",
        "At the same time, Council members indicated that in the recent period, as many countries were easing the containment measures, sentiment was gradually improving.",
        "Referring to the outlook for the global economy, it was pointed out that according to the current forecasts, in the second half of 2020 the global economy will rebound, although the level of activity will be lower than before the pandemic.",
        "In this context, attention was drawn, on the one hand, to the downward revision of the ECB’s forecasts for euro area GDP growth in 2020 and the subsequent years, and, on the other hand, to the initiative to set up a Recovery Fund at the EU level to help boost activity in the EU.",
        "It was pointed out that the proposed value of the fund was significant, yet there was significant uncertainty about the timing of its launch.",
        "It was pointed out that the main risk factors for the fast return of the global economy to the pre-pandemic level continued to include a renewed rise in Covid-19 cases, mounting geopolitical tensions, and primarily, the possible long-lasting impact of the pandemic on economic decisions regarding consumption and investment.",
        "All these factors contribute to considerable uncertainty about the timing and robustness of the recovery in the global economy in the coming quarters.",
        "Council members pointed out that faced with the collapse in economic activity in March and April, many countries had undertaken unprecedented fiscal measures aimed at reducing the scale of the decline in incomes of households and businesses, as well as stimulating economic activity.",
        "It was also pointed out that fiscal stimulus packages in most countries were accompanied by monetary policy easing, which involved interest rate cuts and asset purchases.",
        "Some members of the Council indicated that certain central banks, including the ECB, whose main interest rate had been negative for many years, were still announcing their readiness to lower interest rates.",
        "It was emphasised that further monetary policy easing by the ECB in the recent period was the result of extending and increasing the scale of asset purchases.",
        "The Federal Reserve Bank of the United States had also extended asset purchases and announced it would use any possible tools to support the US economy.",
        "It was noted that the measures undertaken by the major central banks of the developed countries along with the fiscal stimulus programmes launched in those economies had a positive impact on the financial market sentiment, thus contributing to strengthening of emerging economies’ currencies.",
        "Members of the Council stressed that in the recent period the decline in the prices of some commodities had come to a halt, yet they were still markedly lower than at the beginning of the year.",
        "In particular, oil prices– despite having increased in the past few weeks – remained markedly lower than before the outbreak of the pandemic.",
        "Certain members of the Council judged that in the recent period oil prices had been affected by fundamental factors connected with the decline in economic activity and the fact that it was expected to recover only gradually in the subsequent quarters, as well as by the policy of the OPEC+ countries.",
        "Council members pointed out that the prices of major commodities were pushing down inflation, including in Poland’s main trading partners.",
        "At the same time, some Council members indicated that the strong decline in price growth observed in many countries was driving up real interest rates despite monetary policy easing in those economies.",
        "In Poland, data on economic conditions in April showed a strong slump in economic activity, a decline in wages and employment in the enterprise sector and weak consumer and business sentiment.",
        "It was also pointed out that the negative impact of the pandemic on employment was relatively small as strong protective measures had been taken, aimed at protecting jobs and subsidizing the income of employees and the companies employing them.",
        "It was observed that the main adjustments in the labour market still involved the reduction of working hours, the retirement of employees and more frequent use of sickness or care allowance.",
        "The Council emphasised at the same time that the gradual lifting of pandemic-related restrictions started in May and continuing in the recent weeks had translated into a certain improvement in sentiment and would revive economic activity in the subsequent weeks.",
        "Council members expected that the rebound in economic activity – besides the likely further lifting of pandemic-related restrictions – would also be supported by economic policy measures, including NBP’s monetary policy easing, which limits the scale of decline in employment, supporting household income and the financial situation of enterprises.",
        "In the context of the expected economic recovery, some members of the Council also drew attention to the important role played by Poland’s investment in infrastructure.",
        "Certain members of the Council also observed that Poland had a chance to recover relatively quickly from the recession.",
        "At the same time it was noted that the expected economic recovery might be dragged down by the uncertainty about the consequences of the pandemic, lower incomes and weaker business sentiment than in the previous years.",
        "The majority of Council members emphasised that the pace of economic recovery might also be curbed by the lack of significant adjustment of the zloty exchange rate to the global shock caused by the pandemic and NBP’s monetary policy easing.",
        "In this context it was observed that NBP’s monetary policy should limit the risk of zloty appreciation against the main currencies, which would pro-cyclically enhance the negative impact of the sharp decline in external demand on exporters’ income, thus adversely affecting activity and employment in the Polish economy.",
        "As a result, and taking into account the expected weak activity and low price growth abroad, the appreciation of the zloty would increase the risk of deflation, which combined with a higher unemployment rate than before the pandemic would be detrimental to macroeconomic stability.",
        "Council members emphasised that annual CPI inflation had declined in May to 2.9%, falling over three months by 1.8 percentage points.",
        "Some members of the Council observed that despite the strong decline in the total expenditure on services, their annual price growth remained relatively high.",
        "This pointed to a certain bounce-back of demand after some of the restrictions imposed on the service sector had been eased and might result from the growing operating expenses of this sector under the new sanitary regime.",
        "At the same time – in the opinion of those members of the Council – amid recession, sales in the service sector would probably remain subdued in the coming quarters.",
        "It was pointed out that the decline in inflation was accompanied by further deflation of producer prices.",
        "In turn, certain members of the Council observed that the majority of core inflation measures remained at an elevated level, and inflation expectations, despite having declined in the recent period – still suggested that consumers perceived inflation as heightened.",
        "The majority of Council members were of the opinion that considering the expected subdued economic activity globally and in Poland, low forecast inflation abroad and relatively low commodity prices in the global market, inflation would be low in the subsequent years.",
        "At the same time, certain members of the Council upheld the opinion that price growth might be boosted by a rebound in consumption after the pandemic, higher food prices resulting from the likely agricultural drought and growing prices of intermediate goods driven by deglobalisation.",
        "Council members pointed out that NBP’s measures taken so far had contributed to ease financing conditions in Poland.",
        "In particular it was emphasised that interest rate cuts had translated into lower expenses of indebted enterprises and households, supporting their budgets.",
        "It was pointed out that lower loan instalments provide more room for other kinds of spending, boosting demand and helping debtors to timely meet their payment obligations, thus being conducive to higher employment in the economy.",
        "Interest rate cuts translate also into lower yields on government bonds, which reduces the costs of public debt servicing.",
        "It was also emphasised that this effect was significantly reinforced by the asset purchase programmes in place.",
        "Thanks to ensuring liquidity in the market of the purchased assets – which is a direct result of NBP’s intervention in this market – it is possible to finance anti-crisis measures without excessively increasing their costs.",
        "Moreover, NBP also launched the bill discount credit which allows the refinancing of corporate loans on very favourable conditions.",
        "The Council members argued that NBP’s measures would lead to lower unemployment, fewer bankruptcies among Polish enterprises and finally lower risk not only of inflation running below the target, but also of deflation, which would be detrimental to the entire economy, including to the financial system.",
        "Some members of the Council emphasised that the reduced credit risk and the ensuing lower credit losses for commercial banks as a result of NBP’s measures were very important factors which should be considered when assessing the effects of monetary policy on the economy.",
        "At the same time, certain members of the Council pointed out that interest rate cuts exerted a downward pressure on bank interest margins, which might prompt banks to increase their charges.",
        "They also emphasised that as households’ income on bank deposits was reduced as a result of lower interest rates, households would seek other, riskier forms of investment.",
        "Other members of the Council judged that a certain reallocation of savings – in line with households’ preferences as regards the accepted risk-to-profit ratio – might be favourable for the economy.",
        "Referring to the lending policy of commercial banks, these members emphasised that it was affected by many factors, yet NBP’s monetary policy was clearly acting against the procyclical tightening of banks’ lending policy.",
        "The Council members were of the opinion that following significant interest rate cuts in the previous months and the launch of asset purchases, the present meeting should keep the NBP interest rates unchanged and continue to pursue NBP’s remaining measures.",
        "It was pointed out that NBP’s monetary policy easing mitigated the negative effects of the pandemic, limiting the scale of the decline in economic activity and supporting the income of households and enterprises.",
        "As a result, NBP’s monetary policy contributes to mitigating the fall in employment and limiting the deterioration of the financial situation of enterprises, supporting a quicker recovery in economic activity after the pandemic ends.",
        "NBP’s measures reduce the risk of inflation falling below the NBP inflation target in the medium term and, through the positive impact on the financial situation of borrowers, they contribute to the strengthening the stability of the financial system.",
        "The Council decided to keep NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 0.10%, the lombard rate at 0.50%, the deposit rate at 0.00%, the rediscount rate at 0.11%, and the discount rate at 0.12%.",
        "At the same time, it was underscored that uncertainty persisted about the pace and robustness of the improvement in the global economic conditions.",
        "The further path of the pandemic remained the key risk factor here.",
        "In this context, the Council members observed that the number of new coronavirus infections in the world was on the rise again, exceeding in many countries the March or April 2020 figures.",
        "As a result, some countries were opting for a restoration or tightening of epidemic restrictions.",
        "The Council members pointed out that according to current forecasts economic activity in the largest economies, including in the Poland’s immediate environment, would rebound to the pre-pandemic levels only in 2022.",
        "It was assessed at this point that global economic activity in the subsequent quarters would be hampered by – besides increased uncertainty – deteriorating labour market conditions, a decline in global trade and a rise in debt, which, while helping to alleviate the impact of the economic crisis at the moment, might drag on growth in the longer term.",
        "According to current forecasts, global inflation is to remain low, which, apart from depressed economic activity, will also be supported by the previous fall in global commodity prices.",
        "In this context, it was pointed out that the annual price growth in the euro area had dropped below zero in August.",
        "The Council members observed that considering the above macroeconomic conditions, the major central banks were signalling the maintenance of interest rates at a level close to zero and continued asset purchases in the subsequent quarters.",
        "Against this background it was emphasised that the Federal Reserve had recently de facto raised its inflation target for the subsequent years, thus indicating it would not tighten its monetary policy for some time to come.",
        "In Poland, a marked decline in GDP occurred in 2020 Q2, albeit smaller than in many other EU countries.",
        "Council members emphasised that despite the fall in both domestic demand – including private consumption and investment – and exports, the decline in GDP was smaller than forecast.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that in 2020 Q2, the number of persons working in the economy had fallen and wage growth in the economy had declined.",
        "The Council members assessed that incoming data pointed to an improvement in sentiment and a revival in economic activity in the past few months, even though GDP would remain lower in 2020 Q3 than the year before.",
        "It was pointed out that the annual growth in retail sales, industrial output and exports had turned positive by July, yet the decline in construction and assembly output had deepened.",
        "It was highlighted that business and consumer sentiment indicators had decreased in August, following their prior rise.",
        "Certain Council members stressed that surveys of companies suggested that their investment activity would remain limited.",
        "On the other hand, certain Council members highlighted the fact that the expected rise in consumption and exports, coupled with the implementation of infrastructure projects from public funds, would support investment.",
        "The Council members were of the opinion that economic activity might be expected to pick up further in the subsequent months.",
        "This would be supported by continued improvement in the economic climate in the external environment of the Polish economy and economic policy measures, including monetary easing by NBP.",
        "At the same time, it was assessed that the scale of the recovery might be limited by uncertainty about the future development and effects of the pandemic, which might have an adverse effect on consumption, investment and lending.",
        "The Council members also observed that the scale of economic recovery might be dampened by the lower wage growth and weaker business sentiment than in previous years.",
        "The majority of the Council members judged in this context that the risks to economic growth in the coming quarters were mostly tilted to the downside.",
        "The majority of Council members were of the opinion that the pace of economic growth might be also limited by the lack of a visible zloty exchange rate adjustment to the global pandemic-driven shock and to the monetary easing introduced by NBP.",
        "The Council members also emphasised that a key factor determining economic conditions in the coming quarters would be the situation in the labour market.",
        "Against this background, it was pointed out that wage growth had slowed down substantially in recent months, while the decline in the number of working persons and the increase in unemployment was limited.",
        "At this point, some Council members drew attention to the fact that as the instruments of the anti-crisis shield were phased out, a greater adjustment to the depressed demand in the economy might take place, which would have a negative impact on household sentiment and consumption.",
        "In this context, it was pointed out that the concerns of the surveyed households about unemployment had risen recently.",
        "When referring to inflation, the Council members emphasised its decline to 2.9% y/y in August 2020.",
        "It was pointed out that the annual CPI index was 1.8 percentage points lower in August than in February 2020.",
        "Some Council members underlined the sustained negative producer price growth.",
        "In turn, certain Council members observed that core inflation and services price growth continued to exceed CPI inflation.",
        "The majority of the Council members judged that inflation might be expected to decline further in the subsequent quarters, which would be supported by the persistently negative output gap, higher unemployment, slower wage growth and absence of inflationary pressure from abroad.",
        "A further decline in inflation was also indicated by external forecasts.",
        "These members judged that although some regulatory factors might put upward pressure on prices, their impact on inflation would probably be smaller than in 2020.",
        "On the other hand, certain Council members were of the opinion that inflation in the coming quarters might remain close to the currently observed level, which might result from the persistence of elevated services price growth, impact of regulatory factors and a potential rise in commodity prices.",
        "The Council members pointed to out a decrease in annual lending growth in the economy.",
        "In this context, particular attention was given to the decline in corporate lending growth.",
        "It was stressed that the decline had been caused to a large extent by lower demand for working capital loans, which might be related to companies receiving funds as part of the anti-crisis shield.",
        "Certain Council members judged that the drop in corporate lending in recent months was cyclical in nature and that the surveyed enterprises did not report any deterioration in the availability of bank credit.",
        "In contrast, certain Council members drew attention to a tightening of lending criteria reported by banks.",
        "The Council members observed that the measures taken by NBP so far had contributed to an easing of financing conditions in Poland.",
        "In particular it was emphasised that interest rate cuts had translated into lower expenses of indebted enterprises and households, and as a result they supported their budgets.",
        "It was also judged that the NBP interest rate cuts were reflected in lower yields on Treasury bonds.",
        "It was underlined that this effect was boosted by the asset purchases conducted by NBP.",
        "Certain Council members emphasised that in response to the reduction in the NBP interest rates, commercial banks had also cut interest rates on deposits.",
        "In the opinion of these Council members, cutting interest rates on bank deposits led to an increase in current deposits at the expense of term deposits, and to depositors seeking higher-risk investment, including in the real estate market.",
        "Yet the majority of Council members assessed that no imbalances that might pose a threat to macroeconomic or financial stability were building up in the real estate market.",
        "The majority of Council members judged that due to their positive impact on the financial position of indebted enterprises and households, the interest rate cuts would support the stability of the banking sector.",
        "These members also judged that the banking sector was characterised by high capital ratios and high liquidity, and that lending margins remained relatively high, which created favourable conditions for banks to expand lending.",
        "It was pointed out that the increased risk in the economy had been a factor curbing lending.",
        "Certain Council members pointed out that the number of banks reporting losses had increased.",
        "The Council members were of the opinion that following the earlier significant interest rate cuts and the launch of asset purchases, the present meeting should keep interest rates unchanged and continue to pursue NBP’s remaining measures.",
        "It was pointed out that NBP’s monetary policy easing mitigated the negative economic effects of the pandemic, limiting the scale of the decline in economic activity and supporting the income of households and enterprises.",
        "As a result, NBP’s monetary policy contributes to mitigating the fall in employment and limiting the deterioration of the financial situation of enterprises, supporting a quicker economic recovery.",
        "NBP’s measures reduce the risk of inflation falling below the NBP inflation target in the medium term, and through a positive impact on the financial situation of borrowers, they contribute to the strengthening of the stability of the financial system.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 0.10%, the lombard rate at 0.50%, the deposit rate at 0.00%, the rediscount rate at 0.11%, and the discount rate at 0.12%.",
        "at levels suggesting the likely persistence of weak activity also in the coming months.",
        "Attention was drawn to the considerable uncertainty about the outlook for global economic growth.",
        "According to the current forecasts, global GDP will decline significantly in 2020.",
        "The year 2021 will see a rebound in economic activity, although the pace of the recovery will probably be slower than previously expected.",
        "It was pointed out that the renewed rise in COVID-19 cases, mounting geopolitical tensions and, primarily, the possible long-lasting impact of the pandemic on economic decisions of households and enterprises were risk factors for the fast return of global economic activity to the pre-COVID-19 levels.",
        "Council members pointed out that the uncertainty about the outlook for global growth contributes to the heightened price volatility in the financial markets In turn, the weakening current and forecast demand was a factor driving down the prices of many commodities.",
        "Prices of energy commodities, including oil, are lower than at the beginning of the year.",
        "Certain members of the Council assessed that oil prices would remain below the previous years’ levels in 2021.",
        "It was noted that the recent months had also seen declines in the prices of some food commodities.",
        "Along with declining economic activity, this contributed to a drop in inflation in many countries, including in Poland’s main trading partners.",
        "The majority of Council members judged that given the current developments, there was a significant risk of deflation or permanently subdued inflation in the global economy which – given the considerable rise in public debt driven by fiscal stimulus packages – would have a negative impact on the outlook for global economic growth and macroeconomic stability.",
        "Other members of the Council pointed out that the recovery from the pandemic crisis would be accompanied by inflation.",
        "It was pointed out that in order to limit the negative consequences of the pandemic, many economies had introduced fiscal stimulus packages on a very large scale.",
        "It was indicated that the implemented fiscal stimulus packages were aimed at mitigating the impact of COVID-19 on the financial situation of enterprises, employment and households’ income.",
        "In many economies fiscal stimulus was accompanied by strong monetary easing.",
        "Many central banks have significantly cut their interest rates.",
        "Yet it was noted that the impact of those cuts on the economy in some countries was limited by a marked decline in price growth, boosting real interest rates.",
        "It was pointed out that many central banks had introduced or extended the existing financial asset purchase programmes and had taken other measures to increase liquidity in the banking sector.",
        "It was indicated that the measures taken by the major central banks of the developed countries along with the fiscal stimulus programmes in those economies had a positive impact on the financial market sentiment, thus contributing to the appreciation of emerging economies’ currencies.",
        "In Poland the economic conditions in the first months of the year were relatively good, although annual GDP growth for 2020 Q1 had decelerated.",
        "At the same time, industrial output and retail sales data for April confirmed the slump in economic activity driven by the COVID-19 pandemic.",
        "The negative impact of the pandemic was also reflected in the deteriorating labour market situation, indicated by falling employment and declining wages in the enterprise sector.",
        "It was also pointed out that the fall in employment had been curbed by the government’s measures aimed at limiting the impact of the pandemic on the labour market.",
        "At the same time, it was emphasized that household and business sentiment had further deteriorated.",
        "It was judged that the gradual lifting of restrictions related to pandemic, which started in May, would revive economic activity.",
        "However, it was stressed that the level of activity in the coming quarters would be lower than before the pandemic due to the declining income of some households and enterprises and higher uncertainty about their future financial situation.",
        "It was observed that the negative impact of the pandemic on economic growth was mitigated by economic policy measures, including monetary easing by NBP.",
        "It was underlined that the measures taken so far by NBP translated into lower operating costs of indebted enterprises, supporting their financial performance and, as a result, limiting the scale of the decline in employment.",
        "In this way and also by reducing the credit charges, NBP’s measures contribute to the improvement of the financial situation of households.",
        "It was also pointed out that although economic policy measures were limiting the negative economic effects of the pandemic, they were not able to offset them entirely.",
        "The majority of Council members indicated that this year’s decline in GDP would be reflected in a fall in the aggregate income in the economy.",
        "It was pointed out that by lowering interest rates, NBP had limited the impact of this fall on the financial situation of indebted households and enterprises.",
        "Certain members of the Council also indicated that interest rate cuts – given, in their opinion, the limited scope for further cuts of interest rates on deposits – would also contribute to decrease in banks’ net interest margins, which might translate into their worse financial performance.",
        "They also underlined that lower interest rates would translate into lower household income on bank deposits.",
        "Those members also stressed that the NBP interest rate cuts implemented so far had been accompanied by the tightening of banks’ credit policy.",
        "The majority of Council members underline, however, that the ECB’s experience suggested that interest rate cuts had a neutral impact on the banking sector’s performance.",
        "Moreover, through the positive impact of lower interest rates on economic activity, employment and wages, and finally on debtors’ capacity to pay debts, interest rate cuts would limit the scale of credit losses, thus supporting the stability of the banking sector.",
        "At the same time, those members observed that the change in interest rates on term deposits would have an appreciable impact on income only in the case of high-value deposits, and would therefore only influence the financial situation of a small group of deposit holders.",
        "Council members stressed that in April annual CPI growth had considerably declined, with a fall in the general price level in month-on-month terms.",
        "This was accompanied by further deflation of producer prices.",
        "The majority of Council members were of the opinion that considering the expected subdued economic activity globally and in Poland and lower commodity prices in the global market, inflation would further decline in the coming months.",
        "In view of the above, the majority of Council members expressed the opinion that despite NBP’s monetary policy easing in the recent period, there was still a risk of inflation falling below the NBP inflation target in the monetary policy transmission horizon.",
        "At the same time, certain members of the Council pointed out that price growth might increase in subsequent quarters which, in their opinion, might be driven by a rebound in consumption after the pandemic, higher food prices resulting from the likely agricultural drought and growing prices of intermediate goods driven by deglobalisation.",
        "The majority of Council members judged that considering the significant scale of the economic downturn and the prospects of lower economic activity in the coming quarters than before the pandemic and, consequently, the persisting risk of inflation falling below the NPB inflation target in the medium term, NBP interest rates should be further cut at the current meeting.",
        "Those members pointed out that such a decision would directly contribute to further reductions in instalments of variable rate loans taken out by enterprises and households.",
        "Lower loan servicing costs will mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic on the financial situation of those entities.",
        "As a result, the interest rate cut will also limit the scale of insolvency of enterprises, will contribute to a lower rise in unemployment, and will limit related secondary effects of the pandemic.",
        "Thus, the interest rate cut will improve the medium-term outlook for the domestic economy and – through the positive impact on the financial situation of debtors – will strengthen the stability of the financial system.",
        "The negative impact of the pandemic on economic activity will also be mitigated by the reduced – as a result of lower interest rates – yields on Treasury bonds and costs of public debt servicing making more room for the necessary fiscal stimulus programmes.",
        "Furthermore, the interest rate reduction will limit the risk of a further appreciation of the Polish zloty against the main currencies, which would strengthen in procyclical fashion the negative impact of the sharp fall of external demand on exporters’ income and, consequently, negatively affect activity and employment in the Polish economy.",
        "As a result, and also given the expected low economic activity and price growth abroad, further appreciation of the zloty would increase the risk of deflation, which along with higher unemployment than before the pandemic would be detrimental to macroeconomic stability.",
        "The majority of Council members pointed out that the interest rate cut, while supporting economic activity through all the above mentioned channels, would limit the risk of inflation falling below the NBP inflation target in the monetary policy transmission horizon.",
        "Certain members of the Council expressed the opinion that the NBP interest rates should be kept unchanged at the current meeting.",
        "Those members expressed the opinion that such a decision was supported by the possible rise in price growth in the coming quarters.",
        "Those members also observed that given the heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook, another interest rate cut would not stimulated lending in the economy.",
        "At the same time, such monetary easing would contribute to rising consumer and asset prices, lowering interest rates on deposits and a rise in fees charged by banks.",
        "The Council members underlined that NBP would continue to purchase Treasury securities and debt securities guaranteed by the State Treasury in the secondary market as part of the structural open market operations.",
        "The aim of these operations will be to change the long-term liquidity structure in the banking sector, maintain liquidity in the secondary market of the purchased securities and strengthen the impact of the NBP interest rate cuts on the economy, that is, strengthen the monetary transmission mechanism.",
        "The timing and scale of the operations will depend on market conditions.",
        "NBP will also offer bill discount credit intended to refinance corporate loans granted by banks.",
        "The majority of Council members pointed out that all the measures taken by NBP reduced the negative economic consequences of the pandemic, by limiting the scale of slowdown in economic activity and supporting the income of households and enterprises.",
        "As a result, NBP’s monetary policy contributes to mitigating the fall in employment and limiting the deterioration of the financial situation of enterprises, supporting a rapid recovery in economic activity after the pandemic ends.",
        "NBP’s measures reduce the risk of inflation falling below the NBP inflation target in the medium term and, through the positive impact on the financial situation of borrowers, they contribute to the strengthening of the financial system stability.",
        "At the meeting a motion was submitted to lower the reference rate by 0.40 percentage points, i.e.",
        "to the level of 0.10% and set the other interest rates at the following levels: the lombard rate at 0.50%, the deposit rate at 0.00%, the rediscount rate at 0.11%, and the discount rate at 0.12%.",
        "The Council set the NBP interest rates as follows: the reference rate at 0.10%, the lombard rate at 0.50%, the deposit rate at 0.00%, the rediscount rate at 0.11%, and the discount rate at 0.12%",
        "During the meeting, the Council pointed out that activity growth in the world economy remained relatively weak, although signals concerning a possible trade agreement between the United States and China had translated into some improvement of the sentiment in the global economy at the end of 2019.",
        "Attention was also drawn to a slight increase in the global manufacturing PMI and a slower decline in the global trade.",
        "Despite this, uncertainty about the global economic outlook for the quarters to come persists.",
        "This uncertainty might be aggravated by a rise in the geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and the risk of oil prices rising further.",
        "In the euro area, amid an ongoing downturn in industry, economic activity growth remains slow.",
        "Confidence indicators for the industry and services sectors point to further weak GDP growth in 2019 Q4.",
        "Growth is supported by consumption, which continues to benefit from high consumer confidence and low unemployment.",
        "At the same time, it was observed that in December the European Central Bank had again revised down its forecasts of GDP growth for 2020.",
        "In the United States, economic conditions are still fairly robust when compared to other economies, although activity in the US industry also remains weak, and GDP growth probably slowed down in 2019 Q4.",
        "In China, economic activity growth is slower than in previous years, with data for November 2019 indicating GDP growth stabilisation in 2019 Q4.",
        "Oil prices have risen recently.",
        "The increase in oil prices was initially driven by the improvement in the sentiment concerning trade relations between the largest global economies, and subsequently by a sharp rise in geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.",
        "At the same time, some Council members indicated that the supply of oil from the United States was a factor alleviating the upward pressure on global prices of this commodity, which curbed the impact of negative supply shocks in the oil market.",
        "Furthermore, it was observed that despite higher oil prices, inflation in the external environment of the Polish economy was moderate, and in the euro area it was low.",
        "The European Central Bank is keeping the deposit rate below zero, while conducting asset purchases and signalling the maintenance of loose monetary policy in the coming quarters.",
        "The US Federal Reserve, after the interest rate cuts of 2019, is keeping the rates unchanged.",
        "Proceeding to discuss the information from the Polish economy, the Council started by assessing the economic situation in Poland in 2019.",
        "It was pointed out that GDP growth in 2019 had probably exceeded 4%, unemployment had dropped to a record-low level and confidence indicators had been high.",
        "At the same time, it was emphasised that the zloty exchange rate had been stable, the current account close to zero and lending growth slightly below the nominal GDP growth.",
        "Moreover, public debt in relation to GDP had probably decreased.",
        "Attention was also drawn to the fact that despite higher CPI at the end of the year, the average annual inflation had stood at 2.3%.",
        "Council members underlined that the above indicators confirmed that economic growth was robust and the economy remained balanced both internally and externally.",
        "When analysing recent months' data more closely, it was highlighted that economic conditions in Poland remained good despite gradually slowing economic growth.",
        "GDP growth is supported by stable consumption growth, fuelled by favourable labour market conditions, very strong consumer confidence and disbursement of social benefits.",
        "At the same time, the Council members observed that consumer confidence indicators had declined somewhat in the recent period and signs of weakening labour demand had become apparent.",
        "In this context, some Council members pointed to slower wage growth in enterprises in recent months, although they also noted that raising the minimum wage at the beginning of 2020 would support wage growth.",
        "It was also underlined that incoming information signalled further, albeit slower than in previous quarters, growth in investment and exports.",
        "In this context, certain Council members highlighted the recent strengthening of the zloty exchange rate, which, along with weaker export growth, might negatively affect the financial performance of exporters.",
        "When referring to inflation developments, it was observed that according to the GUS flash estimate, the CPI stood at 3.4% y/y in December 2019.",
        "Available information showed that the higher December inflation was driven by a rise in the prices of food and fuels.",
        "The majority of the Council members assessed that core inflation might have increased as well, which would have been related to higher prices of some services.",
        "Certain Council members indicated that inflation in December had risen more than expected.",
        "These Council members believed that apart from the likely impact of temporary factors, the increase in inflation might have been driven by a gradual weakening of structural factors which had previously constrained consumer price growth, especially that of goods.",
        "In this context, these Council members pointed to a slowdown in the expansion of the discount chains.",
        "The majority of the Council members argued that the higher-than-forecast preliminary CPI reading for December did not affect the anticipated inflation path over the monetary policy horizon.",
        "In their assessment, inflation would rise temporarily in 2020 Q1, to subsequently start declining and approximate the inflation target in 2021.",
        "It was emphasised that inflation in the next few years would be dampened by the expected slowing of economic growth in Poland.",
        "Those Council members underlined that such a scenario was also suggested by medium-term expectations of financial analysts.",
        "The majority of the Council members also highlighted the fact that the temporary rise in inflation anticipated for 2020 Q1 would result mainly from factors beyond the scope of domestic monetary policy, including regulatory factors and supply shocks.",
        "Factors boosting inflation would include higher electricity prices (related to, among others, the climate policy) and more expensive fuels (associated with higher global oil prices).",
        "Moreover, the anticipated rises in waste disposal charges and the excise taxes on alcohol and cigarettes may temporarily heighten inflation as well.",
        "The expansion of the ASF epidemic, in turn, along with other supply shocks, may translate into higher food prices.",
        "Those Council members observed that the above factors, apart from leading to a temporary rise in price growth, would also have a negative impact on real incomes and the sentiment of businesses and households, thus putting downward pressure on demand growth, which would in the medium term hamper the growth in the prices of the remaining goods and services.",
        "Certain Council members drew attention to the persistently slow producer price growth, and the recent appreciation of the zloty, as factors weakening price pressure.",
        "At the same time, certain Council members argued that the expected acceleration of consumer price growth in 2020 might prove stronger than previously estimated.",
        "They indicated that this may result in particular from possible further oil price growth and a stronger pass-through of both rising wages and demand on prices, especially amid the rise of the minimum wage.",
        "At this point, these Council members also drew attention to an increase in households’ inflation expectations.",
        "The majority of the Council members stressed that, faced with uncertainty about the global economic outlook, a considerable number of central banks were currently conducting loose monetary policies, which was a significant factor supporting economic conditions in many countries.",
        "This means that the interest rates of a number of central banks – including in particular the ECB – are negative in real terms and will most likely remain in negative territory for a long time.",
        "At the same time, these Council members pointed out that although the NBP reference rate in Poland was negative in real terms as well, the real interest rates on household and corporate loans were positive, and the total credit growth in the economy remained lower than nominal GDP growth, with corporate lending growth continuing to be weak.",
        "However, certain Council members underlined that the growth of both broad money (M3) and household lending was currently higher than or close to nominal GDP growth.",
        "Referring to corporate investment loans, these Council members judged that they were characterised by low price elasticity, which meant that any possible increase in interest rates on these loans would not have a strong impact on the investment outlays of companies.",
        "Moreover, it was pointed out that inflation increase coupled with no NBP interest rate rises, caused the NBP reference rate to decline in real terms.",
        "Taking into account the current information and forecasts, the majority of the Council members decided that interest rates should remain unchanged.",
        "In their opinion, the outlook for the domestic economy remained favourable, yet GDP growth would most likely be lower than in previous years.",
        "At the same time, the Council assessed that uncertainty as to the scale and duration of the economic slowdown abroad and its impact on domestic economic activity persisted.",
        "Moreover, the majority of the Council members judged that the factors that would most likely boost CPI inflation in the coming months were mainly of a supply-side and regulatory nature.",
        "Therefore they would have only a temporary impact on inflation, while at the same time, they would put a drag on economic activity.",
        "As a result, along with the expected slowdown in economic growth, inflation would stay close to the target over the monetary policy transmission horizon.",
        "In the opinion of the majority of the Council members, the current level of interest rates would hence be conducive to keeping the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic stability, and would at the same time allow meeting the inflation target in the medium term.",
        "The majority of the Council members also expressed an opinion that, taking into account current information, interest rates were likely to remain stable in the coming quarters.",
        "These Council members pointed out that their assessment was supported by current forecasts indicating that inflation would remain in line with the NBP inflation target over the monetary policy horizon amid the forecast gradual slowing in GDP growth.",
        "In the opinion of these Council members, considering lags in the monetary policy transmission mechanism, any interest rate increase under the current conditions would not prevent a temporary rise in inflation in 2020, while at the same time, could deepen the economic slowdown.",
        "However, certain Council members emphasised that there were factors that might keep inflation higher than indicated by the current forecasts.",
        "They noted that the risk of a further rise in inflation and inflation expectations, combined with the small – in their opinion – scale of the expected economic slowdown in Poland, could jeopardise meeting the inflation target in the medium term, which justified – in their view – increasing interest rates at the current meeting.",
        "According to these Council members, such a move would curb the rise in real estate prices, contributing to increasing their affordability.",
        "In turn, certain Council members pointed to signs indicating that global economic conditions would continue to be weak.",
        "In the opinion of these Council members, this could have a negative impact also on economic growth in Poland in the quarters to come.",
        "At the same time, the risk of inflation deviating from the NBP target over the monetary policy transmission horizon was limited.",
        "As a result, a view was expressed that it was justified to lower interest rates at the current meeting and that – in the longer run – it might be justified to consider further cuts in interest rates or the introduction of unconventional monetary policy instruments.",
        "At the meeting, a motion to increase the NBP interest rates by 0.15 percentage points was submitted.",
        "At the meeting, a motion to cut the NBP interest rates by 0.25 percentage points was submitted.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 1.50%, the lombard rate at 2.50%, the deposit rate at 0.50% and the rediscount rate at 1.75%.",
        "During the meeting, the Council noted that incoming data from the global economy indicated a stabilisation of economic growth at a relatively low level.",
        "Despite a recent improvement in sentiment, economic conditions in some economies remained weakened, while available forecasts pointed to a stabilisation in global GDP growth or its merely marginal pick-up in 2020 as compared to the previous year.",
        "At the same time, uncertainty persists about the global economic outlook, related, among others, to the spreading-out of coronavirus, whose impact on economic activity is hard to assess.",
        "In the euro area, economic growth declined in 2019 Q4, amid the ongoing downturn in industry.",
        "It was observed that the situation in the industrial sector remained unfavourable, despite some rise in the PMI indicators.",
        "This has a negative impact on the outlook for growth in the euro area, and current forecasts suggest that GDP growth in 2020 will be slightly lower in that area than in the previous year.",
        "In the United States, economic conditions are still relatively strong compared to other advanced economies.",
        "GDP in 2019 Q4 progressed at a pace close to that of the previous quarter, although it continued to be held back by flagging activity in industry.",
        "Certain Council members judged that the economic climate in this economy might deteriorate, which, in their opinion, was indicated by the negative yield differential between short- and long-term Treasury securities.",
        "In China, GDP growth stabilised in 2019 Q4 at a lower level than in previous years.",
        "In the recent period, global oil prices have fallen sharply, following their prior rise.",
        "This was assessed to have been driven by concerns about a decline in demand for this commodity in the subsequent quarters due to the potential adverse effect of the coronavirus on economic activity growth in China.",
        "These concerns also brought about a fall in the prices of natural gas and industrial metals.",
        "At the same time, the prices of many food commodities have risen in recent months, and the food commodity price index is running high at the moment.",
        "The increasingly expensive food and the previous rise in oil prices contributed to higher inflation in the external environment of the Polish economy.",
        "The European Central Bank is keeping the deposit rate below zero, while conducting asset purchases and signalling the maintenance of loose monetary policy in the coming quarters.",
        "The US Federal Reserve, after the interest rate cuts of 2019, is keeping the rates unchanged.",
        "Moreover, a number of central banks in large emerging market economies have eased their monetary policy.",
        "When analysing the situation in the Polish economy, it was observed that economic conditions remained strong, although economic growth had slowed down.",
        "According to preliminary GUS data on GDP in 2019, GDP growth in 2019 Q4 may be estimated to have fallen by more than expected.",
        "GDP growth is supported by the rising consumption, which, however, has probably slowed down notwithstanding the strong financial position of households.",
        "Some Council members assessed that this could have followed from a slight weakening of household sentiment.",
        "Certain Council members expressed the view that slower real consumption growth might also have been driven by higher price growth than at the beginning of 2019.",
        "It was observed that preliminary GDP estimates suggested a possible pick-up in investment growth in 2019 Q4.",
        "In this context, some Council members pointed to the uncertainty about the pace of investment growth in 2019 Q4 related to weaker readings of some sectoral data over the past few months.",
        "According to preliminary estimates, export growth also continued in 2019 Q4, albeit probably at a slower pace than in the preceding quarter.",
        "It was pointed out that export growth was benefiting from strongly rising exports of services.",
        "Growth in external sales of goods, on the other hand, had probably halted.",
        "It was judged that this was a sign of the increasing impact of the weakened conditions in the external environment of the Polish economy on external sales and domestic economic activity.",
        "The Council members judged that given the slower than expected implied GDP growth in 2019 Q4, economic growth in 2020 might also prove weaker than previously forecast and slower than the estimated potential output growth.",
        "In this context, some Council members drew attention to a recurring decline – following a few months of improvement – in the PMI index and the results of the NBP surveys of enterprises signalling weaker expectations of financial performance of firms and lower forecasts of their investment activity in 2020.",
        "They also pointed out that the outlook for economic activity in Poland’s immediate environment remained a significant source of risk of slower growth in the domestic economy.",
        "When referring to inflation processes, it was observed that annual CPI inflation stood at 3.4% y/y in December 2019.",
        "An increase in price growth was driven, above all, by higher food prices related to the spread of the ASF epidemic, combined with a rise in fuel prices on the back of prior increases in global oil prices.",
        "At the same time, the rises in waste disposal charges, insurance premiums and air fares were reflected in higher service price growth.",
        "High growth of administered prices was also noted.",
        "As a consequence, core inflation also rose, although it runs at moderate level.",
        "Some Council members expressed the opinion that faster than in previous years growth in service prices was a natural and expected response of the economy to several quarters of the ongoing expansion in consumer demand and income.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that the prices of non-food products were still rising slowly, rendering a still moderate total growth in goods and services prices excluding the impact of supply-side and regulatory factors.",
        "The Council members noted that according to current forecasts, inflation would rise in the coming months and might exceed the upper limit of band for deviations from the inflation target.",
        "It was observed that the rise in inflation was to be primarily the effect of supply-side and regulatory factors, which were beyond the direct influence of domestic monetary policy.",
        "These included the increase in the prices of electricity, further rises of waste disposal charges, increase in excise taxes and rising meat prices resulting from the ASF epidemic spreading out further and the related strongly rising demand from China for European pork.",
        "The majority of the Council members pointed out that the rise in inflation would be driven by supply shocks that negatively affect aggregate demand growth.",
        "In effect, these Council members judged that the rise in inflation above the upper limit for deviations from the inflation target would only be temporary, and as the impact of those factors faded, and amid the anticipated weakening of economic growth, inflation would subside and return close to the inflation target over the monetary policy horizon.",
        "In turn, certain Council members argued that considering the persistence of some of the factors increasing inflation, price growth might be higher than currently forecast.",
        "At the same time, in those Council members’ opinion, the scale of economic slowdown would be limited and thus would not weaken demand pressure substantially.",
        "Those Council members assessed that in the face of the current heightened inflation there was a risk of mounting wage pressure and the occurrence of second-round effects.",
        "As a consequence, although price growth in the second half of 2020 will probably be lower than in the first half of the year, according to these Council members it might continue above the inflation target over the monetary policy horizon.",
        "Those Council members also observed that some measures of inflation expectations of households and businesses had risen recently.",
        "They judged that the rising inflation expectations of enterprises, amid lower profitability of their operations than in previous years, might increase the propensity of firms to raise prices.",
        "Yet the majority of the Council members noted that households’ and enterprises’ inflation expectations were adaptive and their rise mainly reflected higher current inflation.",
        "It was indicated that given the expected economic slowdown, the propensity and ability of firms to raise prices would be limited.",
        "Furthermore, it was observed that financial analysts forecast inflation to decline to around 2.5% next year.",
        "The majority of the Council members pointed out that in the current global economic conditions, real interest rates were at negative levels in many countries, including in all the economies of Central and Eastern Europe, and that their level in Poland was among the highest in the region.",
        "At the same time, these Council members noted that although the NBP reference rate in Poland was negative in real terms, the real interest rate on loans to households and corporations was significantly positive.",
        "They also emphasised that the average interest rate on new loan agreements for households in Poland was currently one of the highest of all the economies of the European Union.",
        "These Council members additionally highlighted the recent marked slowdown in lending growth in the economy.",
        "They also underlined that in 2019 the loan-to-GDP ratio had further declined.",
        "However, certain Council members pointed out that – with no NBP interest rate increases – the forecast rise in inflation would cause the NBP reference rate to decline in real terms to a more negative level.",
        "Those Council members judged that the negative level of real interest rates, in their opinion, was conducive to rapid lending growth, including in particular lending growth in consumer loans to households.",
        "They also expressed the view that the low level of real interest rates was responsible for the high growth in current deposits and also increased demand for other, more risky assets, including real estate.",
        "Taking into account current information and forecasts, the majority of the Council members decided that interest rates should remain unchanged.",
        "In their opinion, the outlook for the domestic economy remained favourable, yet GDP growth would be lower than in previous years.",
        "At the same time, the Council assessed that uncertainty as to the scale and duration of the economic slowdown abroad and its impact on domestic economic activity persisted.",
        "The Council observed that according to current forecasts, in the coming months inflation might exceed the upper limit for deviations from the inflation target.",
        "At the same time, the factors that would most likely boost CPI inflation in the coming months were mainly of a supply-side and regulatory nature.",
        "Therefore they would have only a temporary impact on inflation, while at the same time they would put a drag on economic activity.",
        "As a result, along with the expected slowdown in economic growth, inflation would decline and return close to the target over the monetary policy transmission horizon.",
        "In the opinion of the majority of the Council members, the current level of interest rates would hence be conducive to keeping the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic stability, and would at the same time allow meeting the inflation target in the medium term.",
        "The majority of the Council members also expressed an opinion that, taking into account current information, interest rates were likely to remain stable in the coming quarters.",
        "These Council members pointed out that their assessment was supported by current forecasts indicating that inflation would remain in line with the NBP inflation target over the monetary policy horizon amid a more pronounced slowdown in GDP growth than previously forecast.",
        "In the opinion of these Council members, considering lags in the monetary policy transmission mechanism, any interest rate increase under the current conditions would not prevent a temporary rise in inflation in 2020, but at the same time could deepen the economic slowdown and cause inflation to fall below the target over the monetary policy horizon.",
        "However, certain Council members judged that over the monetary policy horizon inflation might be higher than indicated by the current forecasts.",
        "They pointed out that such a risk was related to the possible persistence of some of the factors currently raising price growth.",
        "In the opinion of these Council members, should incoming data and the projection indicate an increase in this risk, it might be justified to raise interest rates in the coming period.",
        "In turn, certain Council members pointed to the increased risk of a sharper and more lasting global economic slowdown, as well as to further signs indicating the transmission of the weak global economic conditions into economic growth in Poland.",
        "At the same time, the risk of inflation deviating from the NBP target over the monetary policy transmission horizon was limited.",
        "As a result, a view was maintained that it was justified to lower interest rates now and that – in the longer run – it might be justified to consider further cuts in interest rates or the introduction of unconventional monetary policy instruments.",
        "At the meeting, a motion to cut the basic NBP interest rates by 0.25 percentage points was submitted.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 1.50%, the lombard rate at 2.50%, the deposit rate at 0.50% and the rediscount rate at 1.75%.",
        "During the meeting the Council members pointed out that after a sharp fall in global GDP in 2020 Q2, economic activity rebounded in Q3.",
        "The recovery was supported by the earlier relaxation of the epidemic restrictions in many countries, the fiscal measures launched, and the accompanying loosening of monetary policy, including interest rate cuts and asset purchases by central banks.",
        "However, it was indicated that economic activity in most countries remained below the levels observed before the onset of the pandemic.",
        "The Council members observed that a sharp rise in COVID-19 infections had been recorded at the beginning of 2020 Q4, and many countries had tightened the epidemic restrictions again.",
        "As a result, the economic outlook in the external environment of the Polish economy had deteriorated and uncertainty about the future global economic climate had increased.",
        "In this context, it was observed that GDP might be expected to decline again in many economies in 2020 Q4.",
        "Yet it was assessed that the decline would be smaller than in the spring, i.e.",
        "during the first wave of the pandemic.",
        "It was indicated that the foreign trade channels remained open, and some of the firms had adapted their production processes to the sanitary requirements.",
        "As a result, production in industrial companies had not been halted so far, and industry in many economies had remained relatively resilient to the spread of the second wave of the pandemic.",
        "However, the Council members drew attention to the fact that the data as well as consumer and business confidence might lag behind developments of the second wave of the pandemic.",
        "At the same time, it was assessed that the services sector, which made the largest contribution to GDP, was the most heavily affected by the pandemic.",
        "The sentiment in this sector had already deteriorated sharply in many economies.",
        "It was emphasised at this point that the scale of new infections during the autumn wave of the pandemic was several times larger than in the spring.",
        "Against this background, current forecasts suggested that economic activity in the major economies of the world, including the United States and the euro area, would remain weak over a longer period and would not return to the pre-pandemic levels in the following year.",
        "Given the above factors, it was pointed out that the highly expansionary macroeconomic policy might be expected to continue.",
        "Some Council members emphasised that amid the weaker business conditions, central banks signalled that they would keep interest rates low for a longer time to come, and would continue asset purchases as well.",
        "It was observed that the rise in global infections had contributed to a slump in confidence in international financial markets, which was reflected, among others, in a weakening of emerging market currencies.",
        "It was emphasised that due to the flagging economic activity, commodity prices remained markedly lower than at the beginning of the year.",
        "Against this background price growth in many countries, including Poland’s main trading partners, remained slow.",
        "When referring to the Polish economy, the Council members assessed that the incoming data as of September suggested that there had been a relatively rapid rebound in economic activity.",
        "It was pointed out that in September industrial output and retail sales had risen year-on-year, although construction and assembly output had continued to fall.",
        "This was accompanied by a certain improvement in the labour market situation, including higher average wage growth in the corporate sector.",
        "However, it was emphasised that according to available estimates, in 2020 Q3 economic activity remained lower than a year ago.",
        "The Council members judged that – similarly to many other countries in the world – amid a marked deterioration in the epidemiological situation and the tightening of the epidemiological restrictions, GDP could be expected to decrease in 2020 Q4 compared to 2020 Q3.",
        "This was indicated, among others, by the mobility data.",
        "According to them, traffic in shopping and entertainment centres had dropped and road traffic had declined.",
        "Growth in payment card transactions had also fallen significantly.",
        "While discussing the growth outlook, the Council members pointed out that according to the results of the November projections, GDP would grow in 2021, although the level of economic activity would probably be limited, and output gap would remain negative.",
        "It was underlined that in these conditions a rise in unemployment was forecast as well as a fall in the number of persons employed.",
        "It was pointed out that high uncertainty persisted about the further development of the pandemic and its impact on the economy.",
        "For this reason, GDP growth was mainly subject to downside risk in the November projection.",
        "Some Council members expressed the opinion that in the coming quarters a temporary easing and tightening of the sanitary restrictions was possible in response to changes in the epidemiological situation, which would constitute an important condition for the development of the economic climate.",
        "Certain Council members argued in this context that some economic entities would limit their activity along with the development of the pandemic, regardless of restrictions introduced.",
        "Taking into account these conditions, the Council members pointed out that in the coming period domestic economic conditions would be held back by a decline in activity in the services sector, restrictions introduced in trade, increased uncertainty about the further course and effects of the pandemic and a deterioration in economic agents’ sentiment.",
        "It was pointed out that domestic economic activity may also be limited by economic downturn in the environment of the Polish economy as well as by the lack of a visible and more durable zloty exchange rate adjustment to the global pandemic-driven shock and to the monetary policy easing introduced by NBP.",
        "At the same time, it was observed that uncertainty about investment developments persisted.",
        "The Council members judged that economic activity would be supported by the economic policy measures, including the easing of NBP’s monetary policy.",
        "At the same time, it was observed that currently many enterprises were better prepared for the pandemic than they had been in the spring, both with regard to the sanitary regime and the liquidity buffer.",
        "The share of online trade had also increased.",
        "Moreover, certain Council members pointed out that in the coming months investment might be supported by the implementation of the public infrastructure projects.",
        "When referring to inflation, the Council members emphasised that it remained consistent with the NBP’s symmetrical inflation target.",
        "In the recent months annual CPI growth had remained close to 3.0% y/y.",
        "It was observed that the annual inflation rate in Poland continued to be boosted by the statistical effects of the earlier increases in administered prices, including waste disposal charges and energy prices.",
        "In this context it was pointed out that the inflation rate excluding administered prices remained close to 2% y/y.",
        "The majority of the Council members underlined that according to the NBP’s November projection, inflation would decline in 2021 and would remain consistent with the NBP inflation target over the projection horizon.",
        "The Council members pointed out that the decline in inflation in 2021 would be supported by the persistence of negative output gap as well as the higher level of unemployment, which would hold back growth in unit labour costs.",
        "The persistently low price growth in the environment of the Polish economy would also probably dampen inflation.",
        "At the same time, it was emphasised that the regulatory factors of a supply-side nature, including the introduction of the so-called capacity charge and the forecast further increase in waste disposal charges would continue to boost inflation.",
        "Certain Council members argued that in 2021 price growth would be subject to downside risks.",
        "However, certain Council members judged that inflation might be higher than foreseen in the November projection.",
        "These Council members argued that, besides growth in administered prices, price growth might also be boosted by faster growth in service prices.",
        "At the same time, they pointed out that the increase in the minimum wage, which might also translate into an adjustment of the wages of people earning more than the minimum wage, might also boost inflation.",
        "Certain Council members were also of the opinion that due to a possible faster growth in prices of capital goods than consumer goods, GDP deflator might be higher than CPI inflation.",
        "When discussing monetary policy, the Council members judged that the measures taken by NBP so far had contributed to an easing of the monetary conditions.",
        "In particular, interest on loans and Treasury bond yields had declined and currently remain low.",
        "This had a positive impact on indebted entities, limited the credit losses of banks and lowered the costs of public debt servicing, thus providing additional room for the necessary fiscal stimulus.",
        "It was observed that NBP’s monetary policy mitigated the negative economic impact of the pandemic, supported economic activity and stabilised inflation at the level consistent with the NBP’s medium-term inflation target.",
        "Due to its positive impact on the financial situation of debtors, it was also conducive to the strengthening of financial system stability.",
        "The Council members were of the opinion that the present meeting should keep interest rates unchanged and continue to pursue the NBP’s remaining measures.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 0.10%, the lombard rate at 0.50%, the deposit rate at 0.00%, the rediscount rate at 0.11%, and the discount rate at 0.12%.",
        "During the discussion the Council members pointed out that 2020 Q3 had seen a strong global economic recovery, although in most countries economic activity had not returned to its pre-pandemic levels.",
        "At the same time, it was underlined that in view of the significant increase in the number of new COVID-19 cases in October and November together with renewed tightening of the pandemic restrictions, the economic conditions in many countries had deteriorated.",
        "The weakening of economic activity was observed mainly in services, with a limited – so far – impact of intensification of the pandemic on the situation in industry.",
        "In Europe the epidemiological situation had deteriorated significantly, and available forecasts indicated that in many European economies – including in the euro area – GDP might decline in 2020 Q4.",
        "Moreover, it was underlined that in the coming quarters only a gradual rebound of economic activity could be expected in the euro area, and it might take over 2 years for GDP to return to its prepandemic level.",
        "At the same time, it was observed that – despite the development of COVID-19 vaccines – uncertainty about the global outlook remained high, mainly driven by the future course of the pandemic.",
        "Information on the results of clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines had contributed to some improvement in global financial market sentiment.",
        "At the same time, global commodity prices remained significantly lower than at the beginning of the year.",
        "In particular, oil prices were lower than before the outbreak of the pandemic.",
        "According to certain Council members, the persistently low oil prices mainly resulted from a significant fall in demand for this commodity due to the continuing economic downturn in many economies.",
        "In view of the lower commodity prices, as well as the weaker economic activity due to the pandemic inflation, in many countries was running at low levels, and in the euro area price growth had been negative for several months.",
        "The majority of the Council members judged that, taking into account the expected economic developments, i.e.",
        "only gradual improvement in the economic situation and elevated unemployment, price growth in Poland’s immediate environment would most likely remain very low in the coming years.",
        "It was pointed out that in the current conditions the central banks of the major economies were keeping interest rates low and purchasing assets.",
        "The majority of the Council members underlined that some of them, i.e.",
        "the central banks of England, Australia and Sweden, had recently further eased their monetary policy, and the ECB had indicated that it might ease monetary conditions at its December meeting.",
        "These Council members drew attention to the fact that some of the major central banks were communicating their intention to keep interest rates low in the coming years.",
        "In the opinion of these Council members, the Polish economy was therefore highly likely to be functioning in conditions of expansionary monetary policy around the world for many quarters to come.",
        "When referring to the Polish economy, it was pointed out that data on GDP in 2020 Q3 confirmed the marked recovery in activity compared to the previous quarter.",
        "However, it was observed that despite this improvement in the economic conditions, annual GDP growth remained negative.",
        "It was pointed out that the recovery in consumer demand had boosted annual GDP growth.",
        "It was underlined that in 2020 Q3 export growth had also picked up, supported by the improvement in the economic situation abroad.",
        "At the same time, investment growth was significantly below zero.",
        "The Council members judged that in 2020 Q4 – in view of the significant increase in the number of new COVID-19 cases, the tightening of the pandemic restrictions, and the deterioration in the sentiment of economic agents – GDP had most likely declined again compared to the previous quarter.",
        "It was emphasised that the deterioration in the epidemiological situation was having a negative impact mainly on the economic situation in the services sector.",
        "The weakening of activity in this sector in recent months was indicated by the fall in retail sales in October as well as the greatly reduced traffic in retail and entertainment centres and the flagging growth in payment card transactions.",
        "At the same time, it was emphasized that so far the available data did not suggest a significant weakening of activity in industry.",
        "However, some Council members judged that in view of weakened consumer demand in Poland and renewed recession in the euro area, a deterioration in the situation in this sector could not be ruled out in the coming months.",
        "While discussing the situation in the labour market, it was pointed out that employment in the enterprise sector in October had risen again in monthly terms.",
        "This was accompanied by a slight decline in wage growth in this sector.",
        "The Council members judged that 2021 would see a recovery in economic activity, although uncertainty remained about its scale and pace.",
        "It was emphasised that the economic policy measures taken so far, including the easing of NBP’s monetary policy, would have a positive impact on the economic situation.",
        "Certain Council members were of the opinion that in the coming quarters economic activity would also be supported by the implementation of public infrastructure projects.",
        "At the same time, the opinion was expressed that the rebound in economic activity in 2021 might be gradual and that GDP might remain lower than before the pandemic.",
        "The majority of the Council members underlined that according to the available forecasts the output gap would remain negative in 2021, which – along with the still heightened uncertainty and weaker sentiment of economic agents than in previous years – would hold back investment growth.",
        "In turn, in the opinion of these Council members, the forecast rise in unemployment might slow down consumer demand growth.",
        "The majority of the Council members once again drew attention to the fact that the pace of the economic recovery could be limited by the lack of a visible and more durable zloty exchange rate adjustment to the global pandemic-driven shock and to the monetary policy easing introduced by NBP.",
        "At the same time, it was observed that there was still heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook in the coming quarters, and its source continued to be the further course of the pandemic and its impact on the economic situation in Poland and abroad.",
        "When referring to inflation, the Council members pointed out that according to the GUS flash estimate consumer price growth stood at 3.0% y/y in November, i.e.",
        "in line with the NBP inflation target.",
        "Some Council members also drew attention to core inflation and service price growth persisting at elevated levels.",
        "Certain Council members observed that inflation expectations of households and enterprises were heightened.",
        "However, other Council members observed that inflation expectations were significantly lower than at the beginning of 2020.",
        "The majority of the Council members judged that in 2021 inflation would be lower than the 2020 average and would run at a level consistent with the NBP inflation target.",
        "In the opinion of these Council members, inflation would be curbed by the persistence of the negative output gap and the higher level of unemployment than in 2020.",
        "Low price growth in the environment of the Polish economy would probably also act in the same direction.",
        "At the same time, the Council members pointed out that regulatory factors, which act as negative supply shocks, including the further rise in electricity prices for households and waste disposal charges, would continue to have a positive impact on inflation in 2021.",
        "Certain Council members judged that in 2021 inflation might be higher than indicated by current forecasts.",
        "According to these Council members, apart from regulatory factors, price growth would be also boosted by base effects related to the fading impact of the fall in oil prices in 2020.",
        "These Council members expressed the opinion that inflation would also be boosted by the satisfaction of deferred consumer demand.",
        "According to these Council members, the large scale of this effect might be indicated by the significant increase in household and corporate deposits in recent months.",
        "These Council members also stressed that strong growth of money supply might potentially have a pro-inflationary effect.",
        "While discussing domestic monetary policy, the Council members judged that the measures that NBP had taken so far had contributed to an easing of the monetary conditions.",
        "In particular, interest on loans had been lowered, which translated into lower loan instalments – including some of the loans taken out before the outbreak of the pandemic – and an improvement in the financial situation of indebted enterprises and households.",
        "The measures taken by NBP also contributed to lowering Treasury bond yields, which reduced the costs of public debt servicing, thus providing additional room for the necessary fiscal stimulus.",
        "Certain Council members also observed that the easing of monetary policy had failed to contribute to a significant recovery in consumer and corporate loans.",
        "However, the majority of Council members argued that lower corporate loan growth was the result of reduced demand for bank finance in view of the significant scale of public aid obtained in recent months by many economic agents.",
        "It was observed that NBP’s monetary policy mitigated the negative economic impact of the pandemic, supported economic activity and stabilised inflation at the level consistent with NBP’s medium-term inflation target.",
        "Due to its positive impact on the financial situation of debtors, it was also conducive to the strengthening of financial system stability.",
        "The Council members were of the opinion that the present meeting should keep interest rates unchanged and continue to pursue NBP’s remaining measures.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 0.10%, the lombard rate at 0.50%, the deposit rate at 0.00%, the rediscount rate at 0.11%, and the discount rate at 0.12%.",
        "At the same time, the Council members assessed that the recently observed surge in the number of COVID-19 cases worldwide heightened the uncertainty about the pace and robustness of the global recovery.",
        "It was observed that the resurgence of the pandemic inclined some governments to restore some of the restrictions – although, so far, milder ones than those introduced in response to the first wave of the pandemic – which, together with the flagging sentiment of economic agents would have a negative impact on economic activity.",
        "It was observed that the rise in the number of COVID-19 cases also contributed to deteriorating sentiment in international financial markets, which was reflected in a weakening of emerging market currencies, a decline in equity prices and a decrease in the prices of some commodities.",
        "It was emphasised that oil prices remained significantly lower than in previous years.",
        "In the opinion of certain Council members, this resulted mainly from the reduced demand for this commodity amid weakened global economic activity.",
        "At the same time, in the opinion of those Council members, the scale of the decrease in oil prices was curbed by the reduced supply of this commodity in connection with the extension by the OPEC+ countries of their agreement to cut oil production.",
        "The Council members emphasised that in the face of weakened economic activity in many countries and amid the relatively low prices of some commodities, inflation in the global economy remained low.",
        "It was observed that price growth had recently slowed down in many countries.",
        "In the euro area, price growth had been running below zero for two months, and available forecasts suggest that it would also be negative in the subsequent months.",
        "The Council members emphasised that given the above conditions, the major central banks were pursuing highly expansionary monetary policy and signalling their willingness to ease it even further.",
        "It was assessed that considering such announcements, interest rates in many economies, including the euro area, would remain very low also in the coming years.",
        "In Poland, incoming data point to a recovery in 2020 Q3, following a marked – although shallower than in most European countries – decline in GDP in 2020 Q2.",
        "Nevertheless, despite a substantial increase in economic activity, it remains lower than before the pandemic.",
        "The Council members underlined that the initially strong rebound in economic activity resulted in part from the restored activity of some industries and the realisation of households’ deferred demand.",
        "Yet along with the weakening impact of those factors, the pace of the recovery in activity slowed down, as indicated by data on production and retail sales as well as the readings of economic climate indicators.",
        "Certain Council members drew attention to the fact that economic activity was supported by the sustained good situation in foreign trade, reflected in a large surplus in the trade in goods account of the balance of payments.",
        "It was emphasised that the situation in the labour market had not significantly changed in recent months.",
        "The stabilisation in the unemployment rate was coupled with a rise in average employment in the corporate sector in July and August compared to the previous months, yet this rise stemmed mainly from the return of employees from holidays and care leave.",
        "At the same time, wage growth remained significantly lower than in previous years.",
        "The Council members assessed that the recovery might be expected to continue in the coming months, even though uncertainty in this regard had increased due to the resurgence of the epidemic and the risk of a tightening of epidemic restrictions.",
        "The recovery will continue to be supported by the policy measures taken so far, including the easing of monetary policy by NBP.",
        "Some Council members expressed the opinion that economic growth would also be supported by publicly funded infrastructure projects, which will also stimulate the activity of private enterprises.",
        "At the same time, in the opinion of Council members, the recently observed marked rise in COVID-19 cases may contribute to a new deterioration in household sentiment and a reduction in their propensity to consume.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members, downward pressure on consumption may also come from possible more pronounced adjustment of employment occurring with expiring firms’ obligations related to the use of the assistance under anticrisis shield.",
        "The pace of economic recovery may also be curbed by the potential weakening of economic conditions in the external environment of the Polish economy resulting from the worsening epidemiological situation abroad, and – in the opinion of most Council members – due by the absence of a substantial and more permanent adjustment of the zloty exchange rate to the global shock caused by the pandemic and the easing of NBP’s monetary policy.",
        "When referring to price developments, it was pointed out that according to the Statistics Poland flash estimate inflation in Poland was running at 3.2% y/y in September.",
        "Some Council members emphasised that price growth remained consistent with the NBP inflation target.",
        "They observed that inflation readings continued to be boosted by the rises in administered prices introduced at the beginning of 2020, and inflation excluding those prices was running below 2.5% They highlighted the continued negative producer price growth.",
        "In turn, certain Council members emphasised that core inflation and services price growth probably continued to run at an elevated level.",
        "The majority of Council members judged that price growth would probably stabilise in the coming months, and would decline significantly at the beginning of 2021.",
        "These Council members argued that the persistence of the negative output gap, weakened wage pressure due to the higher level of unemployment, and the absence of inflationary pressure abroad would contribute to a decline in inflation next year.",
        "They emphasised that due to the absence of pro-inflationary macroeconomic factors, price growth in 2021 would run at a moderate level, even in the event of regulatory factors boosting it.",
        "However, certain Council members were of the opinion that in the coming quarters the price growth might remain close to the current level.",
        "These Council members judged that the persistence of such price growth would mainly be caused by factors beyond the control of monetary policy, including regulatory factors and possibly the process of deglobalisation.",
        "According to these Council members, inflation would also be boosted next year by the announced increase in the minimum wage, which may also result in an upward adjustment of the wages of higher earners.",
        "The Council members observed that the measures taken by NBP so far had contributed to an easing of the financing conditions in Poland, which translated into both a decline in costs of obtaining funding by private entities, as well as resulted in savings for indebted households and firms.",
        "It was underlined that interest on new consumer and housing loans, as well as on corporate loans, had declined by a similar or greater extent than the NBP reference rate.",
        "Some Council members pointed out that although this was accompanied by a decline in interest on deposits, it was smaller than in the case of loans.",
        "Moreover, these Council members underlined that the measures taken by NBP – both the interest rate cuts and the asset purchases – were contributing to a decline in bond yields, leading to a reduction in the costs incurred by taxpayers as a result of the implementation of the anti-crisis measures.",
        "Certain Council members expressed the opinion that the NBP interest rate cut had led to an increase in current deposits at the expense of term deposits and had prompted the banks to increase their fees.",
        "These Council members also underlined that despite the lower interest on loans, their availability might be limited by banks tightening their credit policy.",
        "In this context, they drew attention to the continued decline in growth in lending to the non-financial sector.",
        "The Council members were of the opinion that the present meeting should keep interest rates unchanged and continue to pursue NBP’s remaining measures.",
        "It was pointed out that NBP’s monetary policy easing mitigated the negative economic effects of the pandemic, supported the economic recovery and reduced the risk of a decline in inflation below the NBP inflation target in the medium term.",
        "Through a positive impact on the financial situation of borrowers, they contribute to the strengthening of the stability of the financial system.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 0.10%, the lombard rate at 0.50%, the deposit rate at 0.00%, the rediscount rate at 0.11%, and the discount rate at 0.12%.",
        "at Poland's main economic partners – had been revised sharply downwards.",
        "At the same time, in China – after probable containment of the epidemic and easing of the restrictions – the first signs of a recovery in economic activity had appeared.",
        "The deterioration in the global economic outlook has kept risk aversion elevated in the global financial markets.",
        "This was reflected in increased price volatility of many assets, as well as a tightening of financing conditions.",
        "At the same time, since the beginning of the year global oil prices have declined significantly.",
        "It was pointed out that this was driven by the fall in current and forecast demand for this commodity amid a sharp contraction of economic activity, in the absence of an agreement on reducing oil production between Saudi Arabia and Russia.",
        "Certain Council members judged that in the coming months oil prices might rise, while remaining lower than in the previous years.",
        "The expected weakening of global demand had also contributed to the fall in the prices of some food commodities.",
        "The Council members judged that the scale of the negative economic effects of the pandemic in many countries might be limited by the fiscal measures adopted.",
        "It was pointed out that the launch of fiscal programmes was mainly aimed at mitigating the impact of COVID-19 on the financial situation of enterprises and – as a result – on the level of employment and household income.",
        "It was underlined that effective measures in this area were key for the ability of economies to restore activity quickly after the resolution of the current disruptions.",
        "The fiscal measures introduced in many economies were accompanied by a significant easing of monetary conditions.",
        "Many central banks had cut interest rates, increased liquidity in the banking sector, and were conducting asset purchases.",
        "It was emphasised that monetary policy easing was being carried out quickly and on a large scale.",
        "The Council members expressed the opinion that the measures taken by the governments and central banks would contribute to an improvement in the mediumterm economic outlook.",
        "At the same time, they emphasised that it was difficult to estimate the scale of their positive impact on economic growth, which, along with the limited capacity to predict the further course of the pandemic, caused significant uncertainty about GDP growth in the coming quarters.",
        "In Poland the economic conditions in the first months of the year were relatively good.",
        "However, the Council members judged that the measures taken to limit the spread of the epidemic – although necessary from the point of view of public health protection – were contributing to a fall in economic activity, the scale of which could be very significant in the short term.",
        "It was emphasised that the fall in economic activity would be accompanied by a deterioration in the situation in the labour market and a reduction in household disposable income.",
        "It was also underlined that the health threat associated with COVID-19 along with the negative economic effects of the epidemic had led to a slump in consumer and business sentiment.",
        "It was judged that after the resolution of the disruptions associated with the pandemic, there would probably be a gradual improvement in the economic situation in the medium term.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that the pace and scale of the recovery were subject to considerable uncertainty.",
        "They would depend on the long-term impact of the disruptions on the income and sentiment of businesses.",
        "It was indicated that should the weakened sentiment persist, it could lower significantly the propensity of enterprises to invest and households to consume, adversely affecting GDP growth and inflation.",
        "It was emphasised that the negative impact of the epidemic on economic growth would be mitigated by the stimulus packages introduced in Poland and many other countries.",
        "It was judged that the strong macroeconomic fundamentals of the Polish economy, related to the low level of internal and external debt and high competitiveness, would have a positive impact on the medium-term economic outlook.",
        "It was underlined that the maintenance of price competitiveness of Polish exports, and also their geographical and sectoral diversity, would support the restoration of Polish foreign sales after the fading of the pandemic, which would take place amid intensified competition in international markets.",
        "It was pointed out that in the coming months inflation would most likely decline significantly.",
        "Slower price growth would be supported by the expected fall in global economic activity and weakening of domestic demand.",
        "Inflation would also be lowered by lower commodity prices in the global markets.",
        "Taking this into account, the majority of the Council judged that – despite the easing of NBP's monetary policy in the recent period – the risk of inflation falling below NBP's inflation target over the monetary policy transmission horizon remained.",
        "Certain Council members expressed the opinion that the fall in economic activity might be accompanied by an increase in price growth in the medium term.",
        "The majority of the Council members judged that, taking into account the significant deterioration in the economic outlook and the increased risk of a fall in inflation below the NBP target in the medium term, NBP interest rates should be cut once again at the current meeting.",
        "These Council members pointed out that the decision would directly lead to a further reduction in instalments on loans with a variable interest rate taken out by enterprises and households.",
        "The reduction in debt servicing costs would therefore mitigate the negative impact of the COVID-19 restrictions on the financial situation of enterprises and households and would reduce the risk of their insolvency.",
        "As a result, the interest rate cut would contribute to limiting the secondary effects of the COVID-19 epidemic – such as an increase in unemployment and a sharp fall in consumer demand – thus improving the country's medium-term outlook and strengthening the stability of the financial system.",
        "It was emphasised that this effect would be strengthened by the positive impact of the interest rate cut on business sentiment after the pandemic had ended.",
        "Mitigation of the negative impact of the pandemic on economic activity would also be supported by a decline – as a result of the decrease in interest rates – in yields on Treasury bonds and the costs of public debt servicing, which would provide more room for the necessary fiscal stimulus.",
        "The majority of the Council members pointed out that an interest rate cut, supporting the economic growth with all of the indicated channels, would reduce the risk of a fall in inflation below the NBP inflation target over the monetary policy transmission horizon.",
        "A view was expressed that although the monetary policy should be eased at the current meeting, it should be made more expansionary through direct influence on the longer end of yield curve, rather than by reference rate cut.",
        "The Council members underlined that in order to strengthen the easing of monetary conditions in the economy, NBP should continue to carry out the purchase of Treasury securities, while extending the range of purchased assets to include debt securities guaranteed by the State Treasury.",
        "Purchase operations will be carried out in the secondary market as part of the structural open market operations.",
        "The aim of these operations will be to change the long-term liquidity structure in the banking sector, maintain liquidity in the secondary market of the purchased securities and strengthen the impact of the NBP interest rate cuts on the economy, that is, strengthen the monetary transmission mechanism.",
        "The timing and scale of the operations will depend on the market conditions.",
        "NBP will also offer bill discount credit intended to refinance corporate loans granted by banks.",
        "It was pointed out that all the measures taken by NBP were aimed at reducing the negative economic consequences of the pandemic and creating the conditions for a rapid recovery in economic activity after the current disruptions had ceased.",
        "As a result, these measures support the maintenance of macroeconomic and financial stability, while also reducing the risk of inflation falling below the NBP inflation target in the medium term.",
        "At the meeting a motion was submitted to lower the NBP interest rates by 0.5 percentage points, i.e.",
        "the reference rate to 0.50%, the lombard rate to 1.00%, the deposit rate to 0.00%, the rediscount rate to 0.55%, and the discount rate to 0.60%.",
        "At the meeting a motion was submitted to extend the purchase of assets by including securities guaranteed by the State Treasury and Treasury securities with a maturity not exceeding 1 year.",
        "At the meeting a motion was also submitted to introduce repo operations with over two-year maturity and interest of 0.25%.",
        "The motion did not pass.",

        "These members observed that a rise in corporate high-tech investment was important for the prospective competitiveness of the Polish economy.",
        "It was also pointed out that the relatively fast growth of exports, supported by the recovery in the immediate environment of the Polish economy, including Germany, was an additional driver of GDP growth.",

        "Moreover, exports would add to economic activity growth.",
        "Some Council members emphasised that the increase in external sales might be higher than previously expected due to the improvement in the outlook for economic growth in the euro area.",
        "At the same time, some Council members expressed the opinion that the pace of export growth might be dragged down by the exchange rate of the zloty being stronger than in the previous quarters.",
        "In the opinion of other Council members, in turn, the level of the exchange rate is still higher than the average export profitability exchange rate as declared by enterprises.",
        "These members also emphasised the considerable import intensity of export production, limiting its sensitivity to exchange rate changes.",

        "In the opinion of some Council members, the coming quarters may see a further acceleration in wage growth in companies.",

        "Certain Council members were of the opinion that after the lowering of the statutory retirement age labour supply would be contained as a considerable part of the eligible employees would retire.",
        "Yet other Council members underlined that the scale of this impact would be limited due to the high proportion of non-working persons among those retiring and a probability that many retired employees would remain active in the labour market.",
        "While analysing inflationary developments in Poland, it was pointed out that the annual consumer price growth had decreased in December.",
        "It was noted that inflation was still being boosted by high food prices.",
        "At the same time, core inflation net of food and energy prices remains low due to the moderate growth in prices of services and the continued fall in prices of goods.",

        "These members judged that the stabilisation of interest rates would continue to help meet the inflation target, while supporting the maintenance of the balanced economic growth, including the expected further recovery in investment.",
        "Moreover, these Council members pointed out that the need to take into account the monetary conditions in the immediate environment of the Polish economy, including the likelihood of the maintenance of negative interest rates in the euro area, also spoke in favour of keeping the current level of interest rates in the coming quarters.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members, should data and forecasts incoming in the following quarters suggest a more marked intensification of inflationary pressure than expected, most notably associated with a possibility of a stronger acceleration in wage growth, it might be justified to consider an increase in the NBP interest rates in the quarters to come.",
        "In the opinion of these Council members, developments in inflation expectations would also be important for monetary policy.",
        "At the same time, these members emphasised that in the light of recently released data the risk of a marked increase in inflationary pressure was lower than previously assumed.",
        "A view was expressed that in the event of a significant decline in economic indicators accompanied by a marked deterioration in consumer and corporate sentiment, in the longer run it might be justified to consider a decrease in interest rates.",
        "However, it was underlined that currently, given very favourable economic conditions and very strong confidence of economic agents, there was little likelihood of a decrease in interest rates in the coming quarters.",
        "It was also pointed out that the March projection of inflation and GDP would be an important prerequisite for an assessment of the outlook for monetary policy.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 1.50%, the lombard rate at 2.50%, the deposit rate at 0.50%, the rediscount rate at 1.75%.",
        "During the meeting, the Council noted that the global economic conditions remain favourable.",
        "It was pointed out that activity in the euro area remained strong despite the forecast gradual decline in the region's GDP growth rate in 2018 and in the following years.",
        "It was noted that there was a risk of a more pronounced slowdown in this currency area, should trade tensions with the United States build up.",
        "Yet some Council members judged this risk to be limited.",
        "Certain Council members expressed the opinion that economic growth in the euro area might even be faster than forecast due to a loosening of fiscal policy in some countries of the area.",
        "At the same time, it was noted that GDP growth in the United States in 2018 would probably be higher than in 2017.",
        "It was observed that uncertainty concerning the outlook for global growth was currently elevated.",
        "Apart from the changes in international trade policy, the main risk factor to global economic conditions are developments in oil prices.",
        "It was emphasised that the heightened uncertainty about the outlook for global growth negatively affected the risk sentiment in global financial market, which was reflected in rising bond yields of many emerging market economies and in a depreciation of their currencies.",
        "When analysing changes in commodity prices, it was noted that oil prices persisted at levels markedly higher than the year before, having fluctuated significantly in the recent period.",
        "It was observed that the increased volatility of oil prices was motivated by political and economic decisions made by some of the countries exporting this commodity (i.e.",
        "the countries of the so-called OPEC+ and the United States).",
        "Certain Council members assessed that in the longer run, oil prices might stabilise close to the current level.",
        "While discussing inflation developments in the global economy it was observed that despite good economic conditions and higher oil prices than in the previous year, inflation abroad remained moderate.",
        "It was pointed out that this was driven by the persistently weak domestic inflationary pressures in many countries.",
        "It was assessed that the consistently low inflation in these economies over recent years might be supported by the following factors: the ongoing process of globalisation, including the growth of global supply chains and increased international flows of labour, and the weakened bargaining position of employees in wage negotiations.",
        "Certain Council members expressed the opinion that the impact of some of these factors might ease off in the future.",
        "Referring to monetary policy in the environment of the Polish economy, it was noted that the ECB was keeping interest rates close to zero, including the deposit rate below zero.",
        "At the same time, the ECB continued to purchase financial assets, although it announced a reduction in the scale of purchases from October 2018 and the termination of the programme at the end of the year.",
        "Some Council members judged that interest rates in the euro area would remain low for an extended period of time.",
        "Attention was also drawn to interest rate increases in the Czech Republic and Romania.",
        "Yet some Council members emphasised that economic performance of those countries was different from that in Poland: inflation in the Czech Republic and Romania was above the target, core inflation was elevated and wage growth continued at a faster rate than in Poland.",
        "It was noted that the Federal Reserve had raised interest rates in June and was continuing a gradual reduction of its balance sheet, which – as certain Council members underlined – might have a downward effect on GDP growth in the United States and on global economic conditions.",
        "Discussing the developments in Poland’s real economy, it was pointed out that GDP growth in 2018 Q2 was relatively high and probably close to that observed in the previous quarter.",
        "It was indicated that economic growth was supported by rising consumption, benefiting from the increasing employment and wages, disbursement of benefits and very high consumer sentiment.",
        "It was observed that according to available forecasts, investment growth had picked up in 2018 Q2.",
        "Apart from the continued robust growth of public investment, this had probably been due to a recovery in corporate investment outlays.",
        "Export growth was assessed to have increased somewhat in 2018 Q2, which – in the opinion of most Council members – was propped up by some weakening of the zloty in the recent period.",
        "It was noted that the depreciation of the zloty reflected the drag from heightened uncertainty in the global financial markets, as in the case of many other emerging market currencies.",
        "This uncertainty also contributed to a fall in share prices on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.",
        "With reference to the outlook for economic growth, it was pointed out that according to the July projection, GDP growth in 2018 would remain relatively high and above the level expected in March.",
        "However, in the following years economic growth would gradually slow down.",
        "Some Council members voiced the opinion that the main source of risk for the forecast GDP growth were developments in the environment of the Polish economy.",
        "Certain Council members indicated as the prevailing risk a deterioration in economic conditions abroad, which would lead to a more pronounced slowdown in economic activity in Poland.",
        "In contrast, other Council members judged that the likelihood of the unfavourable scenarios materialising might be smaller than expected, as might be their impact on the Polish economy.",
        "Moreover, economic conditions in the euro area could benefit from the expected easing of fiscal policy in some economies of the region.",
        "In effect, according to those Council members, GDP growth in Poland in the following years might be higher than envisaged in the July projection.",
        "While analysing the current developments in the labour market, a further rise in employment and a fall in the unemployment rate were highlighted.",
        "It was emphasised that these developments were accompanied by stronger wage growth than in the previous year.",
        "However, some Council members stressed that wage growth had remained stable since the beginning of 2018.",
        "These members underlined that the results of the July projection indicated a stabilisation of wage growth also in the subsequent quarters.",
        "They judged that this would be underpinned by the high – and rising – share of enterprises not planning pay rises in the nearest future.",
        "They also emphasised that the continued inflow of foreign workers was curbing the extent of wage growth.",
        "However, other Council members argued that wage growth might accelerate in the following quarters, especially should the demands of pay rises in the public sector – already observed in some occupational groups – mount.",
        "These members judged that any rises in the public sector might in turn spur an increase in wage pressure in the private sector.",
        "Discussing inflation developments in Poland, it was observed that the annual consumer price growth had increased in June as a result of rising fuel prices.",
        "At the same time, inflation net of food and energy prices was lower than at the beginning of the year, and service price growth had slowed down.",
        "In the assessment of some Council members, this suggested that domestic inflationary pressure continued to be weak, despite the relatively high economic growth and faster wage growth than in the previous year.",
        "Other Council members assessed that the recent decline in service price growth had probably been temporary.",
        "While discussing the outlook for price growth, it was indicated that in line with the July projection, inflation in 2018 would be lower than previously expected and stand at 1.8%.",
        "Some Council members emphasised that the inflation forecast had been revised downwards in 2018, despite the increase in oil prices in the global markets and the recent depreciation of the zloty.",
        "They underlined that the downward revision of price growth resulted from a marked decline in core inflation forecasts, observed despite higher GDP growth than previously expected.",
        "The Council members pointed out that according to the July forecast, in the following years inflation was expected to increase gradually.",
        "Most Council members judged that in line with the July projection, inflation would remain close to the target in the projection horizon.",
        "Yet certain Council members judged that consumer price growth might be higher than the July projection envisaged due to the stronger-thanforecast GDP growth, faster wage growth and the renewed rise in service price growth.",
        "These members expressed the opinion that inflation might be additionally enhanced by a stronger pass-through of the rise in global oil prices to fuel prices, resulting from pricing policies of Polish fuel producers.",
        "They also emphasised the forecast rise in core inflation.",
        "In turn, other Council members judged that inflation might be lower than the July projection envisaged due to core inflation rising more slowly.",
        "They expressed the opinion that the absence of a rise in core inflation so far, despite very good economic conditions, increases the probability of its limited growth in the following quarters, especially in the face of the expected slowdown in GDP growth.",
        "The Council members also noted that no clear signs of imbalances were currently observed in the economy.",
        "In particular, it was emphasised that credit to the non-financial sector was growing at a moderate pace, and the real lending rates remained at solidly positive levels.",
        "Growth of the main monetary aggregates was also moderate.",
        "However, certain Council members assessed that the persisting level of reference rate – negative in real terms – might increase the risk of imbalances emerging in the economy, especially in the credit and real estate markets.",
        "They highlighted the relatively fast, in their opinion, rise in consumer loans and the resulting high level of household debt compared to other European countries.",
        "While discussing NBP monetary policy, the Council decided that currently interest rates should remain unchanged.",
        "The Council judged that current information, as well as the results of the July projection, indicated a favourable outlook for economic activity growth in Poland, despite the expected slowdown in GDP growth in the subsequent years.",
        "At the same time, in line with the projection, in the monetary policy transmission horizon inflation will remain close to the target.",
        "As a result, the Council judged that the current level of interest rates was conducive to keeping the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic stability.",
        "The majority of the Council members expressed the opinion that, taking into account current information, the stabilisation of interest rates in the quarters to come would continue to help meet the inflation target, while supporting the maintenance of balanced economic growth, including a further recovery in investment.",
        "Moreover, these Council members pointed out that the need to take into account monetary conditions in the immediate environment of the Polish economy, as well as the heightened uncertainty about the outlook for the global economy, also spoke in favour of keeping the current level of interest rates in the coming quarters.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members, should incoming data and forecasts suggest a further increase in wage growth and a more marked intensification of inflationary pressure than currently expected, it might be justified to consider an increase in the NBP interest rates in the coming quarters.",
        "A view was also expressed that in the event of a significant decline in economic activity indicators accompanied by a marked deterioration in consumer and corporate sentiment, in the longer run it might be justified to consider a decrease in interest rates.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 1.50%, the lombard rate at 2.50%, the deposit rate at 0.50%, the rediscount rate at 1.75%.",
        "During the meeting, the Council noted that global economic conditions remained good.",
        "The weakening in the GDP growth in the euro area in 2018 Q1 was in part due to one-off factors, and the outlook for growth in this economy continues to be favourable.",
        "In line with current forecasts, in 2018 GDP growth in this region will remain close to its level in the previous year and will be gradually slowing down in the following years.",
        "It was indicated that risks around this scenario included changes in the trade policy between the euro area and the United States as well as the political situation in Italy.",
        "Yet some Council members judged that the current situation in Italy did not pose a significant risk to economic conditions in the euro area, although it might contribute to heightened volatility in the financial markets.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that the weaker than expected slowing in economic activity in the United States in 2018 Q1 had also been of a temporary nature.",
        "According to available forecasts, GDP growth in 2018 Q2 would probably pick up considerably, and in the entire 2018 it would be higher than in the previous year.",
        "It was noted that besides the changes in international trade policy, a potential sharp correction in the US equity market might present a threat to both economic growth in the United States and global economic conditions.",
        "It was indicated that developments in oil prices were another source of uncertainty for global growth.",
        "With regard to economic conditions in emerging economies, it was emphasised that GDP growth in China remained stable.",
        "When analysing changes in commodity prices, it was noted that while oil prices had decreased in the recent period, they were still markedly higher than in the previous year.",
        "It was assessed that the decline in oil prices was in part caused by a possible increase in the production of this commodity by some of its exporters (the so-called OPEC+), as signalled by Saudi Arabia and Russia.",
        "In turn, factors containing the decline in oil prices included the imposition of sanctions on oil imports from Iran announced by the United States, as well as the unfavourable economic and political situation in Venezuela.",
        "Certain Council members judged that, against this background, oil prices would probably remain relatively high in the coming months, albeit slightly below their current level.",
        "While discussing inflation developments in the global economy, it was observed that despite good global economic conditions and higher oil prices than in the previous year, inflation abroad remained moderate.",
        "It was pointed out that this was driven by the persistently weak domestic inflationary pressures in many countries.",
        "Referring to monetary policy in the external environment of the Polish economy, it was noted that the EBC was keeping interest rates close to zero, including the deposit rate below zero, and continued to purchase financial assets.",
        "At the same time, the ECB reaffirms its guidance to maintain interest rates at the present levels, even after the end of the asset purchases.",
        "The US Federal Reserve, in turn, continues to gradually reduce its balance sheet, hinting at further interest rate increases in the future.",
        "Certain Council members judged that the tightening of monetary conditions by the Fed might hamper GDP growth in the United States as well as having an adverse effect on global economic conditions.",
        "Discussing the developments in Poland’s real economy, it was pointed out that GDP growth in 2018 Q1 was probably close to that in the second half of 2017.",
        "It was pointed out that economic growth was supported by rising consumption, benefiting from the ongoing improvement in households' financial situation.",
        "It was emphasised that households' real disposable income had risen considerably in 2017, while income inequalities had narrowed down.",
        "As a result, consumers have better assessed their living standards, and their confidence remains very high.",
        "At the same time, the increasing absorption of EU funds, favourable demand outlook and high capacity utilisation support the recovery in investment.",
        "It was observed that public investment remained the main component of growth in gross fixed capital formation, while corporate investment rose at a moderate pace.",
        "Certain Council members pointed out that growth in public investment may be conducive to further recovery in corporate investment activity.",
        "These members also indicated that it could not be ruled out that as the structure of corporate investment had changed– among others, due to a rise in expenditure on intangible assets – the rate of investment conducive to robust and sustainable economic growth in the longer term might be lower at present than in the past.",
        "The Council members underlined a considerable contribution from change in inventories to GDP growth in 2018 Q1.",
        "It was noted that although changes in this category seemed ambiguous, yet they probably resulted from companies' activities aimed at stock replenishment in anticipation of high demand for their products in the quarters to come.",
        "However, it cannot be ruled out that the increase in stocks was due to the accumulation of unsold goods as a result of a weakening of foreign sales in 2018 Q1.",
        "At the same time, it was underlined that export sales growth in 2018 Q1 was significantly slower than in the previous quarters, most likely due to the slowdown in economic activity in the euro area.",
        "While assessing the outlook for economic growth in Poland, it was emphasised that according to current forecasts, GDP growth would remain relatively high in 2018.",
        "Yet, it could decline slightly in the following years.",
        "Certain Council members judged that the short term economic outlook was currently better than expected in NBP's March projection.",
        "It was underlined that the main source of risk for GDP growth in the future were developments in the external environment of the Polish economy.",
        "While analysing the current developments in the labour market, a further rise in employment and a fall in the unemployment rate in 2018 Q1 were highlighted.",
        "It was emphasised that in such conditions part of enterprises reported recruitment difficulties.",
        "However, some Council members pointed out that in the recent period the share of companies with job vacancies had stabilised, and the number of enterprises considering staff shortages as a barrier to their development had declined.",
        "In the opinion of these Council members, this could be due to companies adjusting to more difficult conditions in the labour market, among others, by employing foreigners.",
        "It was underlined that this was accompanied by higher wage growth than in the previous year.",
        "Yet some Council members emphasised that according to data from the national economy, wage growth in 2018 Q1 decreased somewhat.",
        "Certain Council members judged that wage growth would most likely pick up again in the remaining part of the year as a result of – besides the limited supply of skilled labour – the possible pay rise demands in the public sector.",
        "In turn, other Council members pointed out that average wages in this sector between 20102017 had grown on average at a rate similar to that in the corporate sector, and currently wages in both sectors were comparable.",
        "It was indicated that wage growth in the public sector might result from, among others, pay rises of the lowest earners and people employed on civil law contracts.",
        "Some Council members were of the opinion that wage growth in the following quarters should not accelerate significantly and emphasised that the available forecasts indicated it would stabilise at around 7%.",
        "Discussing inflation developments in Poland, it was observed that the annual consumer price growth had increased to 1.7% in May, which was lower than expected.",
        "Some Council members underlined that inflation remained moderate despite a significant rise in fuel prices.",
        "In the assessment of these Council members, this results from the still weak domestic inflationary pressures, as indicated by the persistence of low inflation net of food and energy prices and the slowdown in the prices of services.",
        "While discussing the outlook for price growth, it was indicated that due to the earlier increase in oil prices in the global markets and a certain depreciation of the zloty in the recent period, inflation might rise in the following months.",
        "Certain Council members judged that the transmission of higher oil prices – through increasing transport costs – to the prices of consumer goods might mean that in several months inflation could already be higher than under the current forecasts.",
        "These members also expressed the opinion that the current wage growth, which was lowering the profitability of enterprises, could lead to more marked price growth in the future.",
        "However, other Council members emphasised that according to current forecasts, core inflation would rise slower than expected earlier.",
        "These Council members also underlined that sales margins of enterprises had declined only slightly, and their possible recovery would be – according to the declarations of companies – achieved by price rises only to a limited degree.",
        "While analysing the situation in the credit market, it was underlined that loans to the non-financial sector were growing at a moderate rate.",
        "According to certain Council members, this indicated a lack of excessive demand for external financing on the part of economic entities.",
        "However, other Council members judged that credit growth might be limited by the declining propensity of banks to increase lending to the private sector.",
        "While discussing NBP monetary policy, the Council decided that currently interest rates should remain unchanged.",
        "The Council judged that current information indicated a favourable outlook for economic activity growth in Poland, despite the expected slight slowdown in GDP growth in the subsequent years.",
        "At the same time, in line with available forecasts, in the monetary policy transmission horizon inflation will remain close to the target.",
        "As a result, the Council judged that the current level of interest rates was conducive to keeping the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic stability.",
        "The majority of the Council members expressed the opinion that, taking into account current information, the stabilisation of interest rates would continue to help meet the inflation target, while supporting the maintenance of balanced economic growth, including a further recovery in investment.",
        "Moreover, these Council members pointed out that the need to take into account the monetary conditions in the immediate environment of the Polish economy, including the likelihood of the maintenance of negative interest rates in the euro area, also spoke in favour of keeping the current level of interest rates in the coming quarters.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members, should incoming data and forecasts suggest a further increase in wage growth and a more marked intensification of inflationary pressure than currently expected, it might be justified to consider an increase in the NBP interest rates in the coming quarters.",
        "A view was also expressed that in the event of a significant decline in economic indicators accompanied by a marked deterioration in consumer and corporate sentiment, in the longer run it might be justified to consider a decrease in interest rates.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 1.50%, the lombard rate at 2.50%, the deposit rate at 0.50%, the rediscount rate at 1.75%.",
        "During the meeting, the Council noted that global economic conditions remain favourable.",
        "It was pointed out that activity in the euro area continued to be strong, despite slightly slower GDP growth than in 2017.",
        "It was emphasised that economic activity growth in Germany had picked up in 2018 Q2, supported mainly by robust consumer demand.",
        "The outlook for economic conditions in this economy was assessed as good, despite uncertainty associated with the decline in industrial orders in the previous month.",
        "The consistently favourable conditions for domestic demand in Germany are accompanied by uncertainty about the country's export growth in the following quarters.",
        "However, some Council members judged that in view of a likely agreement between the United States and the European Union, the risk of tariffs being imposed on car imports from Europe to the United States had decreased.",
        "At the same time, it was noted that this year's GDP growth in the United States was higher than in 2017.",
        "GDP growth in this economy had picked up markedly in 2018 Q2, which was mainly driven by a recovery in consumption and greater export momentum.",
        "It was pointed out that the risk for global economic conditions related to the United States' trade policy had diminished somewhat in the recent period, boosting the sentiment in the international financial markets.",
        "However, it was indicated that against the background of the bad economic situation in Argentina and Turkey, investors' propensity to invest in some emerging market economies had declined.",
        "This had an adverse effect on the prices of those countries' assets and contributed to a depreciation of their currencies.",
        "When analysing changes in energy commodity prices, it was noted that oil prices persisted at levels markedly higher than the year before, having fluctuated significantly in the recent period.",
        "It was pointed out that the increased volatility of oil prices was caused by political decisions made by some of the countries exporting this commodity, as well as one-off factors.",
        "It was indicated that in the longer term the level of oil prices would be determined by global economic conditions, technological change and the scale of investment geared to raising the output of this commodity.",
        "While discussing inflation developments in the global economy, it was observed that despite good economic conditions, inflation abroad remained moderate.",
        "It was pointed out that the increase in oil prices in recent months had contributed to higher price indices in many countries.",
        "Certain Council members were of the opinion that for this reason, inflation in the following quarters might also be higher than previously forecast.",
        "At the same time, it was indicated that higher oil prices would have a dampening effect on GDP growth in the oil-importing countries.",
        "Referring to monetary policy in the external environment of the Polish economy, it was noted that the ECB was keeping interest rates close to zero, including the deposit rate below zero.",
        "At the same time, the ECB continued to purchase financial assets, although it reaffirmed its guidance to reduce the scale of purchases from October 2018 and to terminate the programme by year-end.",
        "Some Council members judged that, given the expected gradual economic slowdown and consistently moderate inflation in the euro area, interest rates in this region might remain low for an extended period of time.",
        "It was observed that in the United States, the Federal Reserve continued to gradually tighten monetary policy.",
        "Certain Council members assessed, however, that the pace of the tightening might be slower than previously expected.",
        "It was pointed out that while the monetary policy tightening in the United States could incline investors to withdraw capital from emerging market economies, the risk of a strong capital outflow from those economies which enjoyed a favourable economic conditions and lack of external imbalances was limited.",
        "Discussing the developments in Poland’s real economy, it was emphasised that the 2018 Q2 GDP data pointed to continued robust economic growth.",
        "It was indicated that economic growth was supported by rising consumption, benefiting from the increasing employment and wages, disbursement of benefits and very strong consumer sentiment.",
        "It was observed that this was accompanied by a rise in investment, both in the public sector and in the large company sector, although gross capital formation growth in 2018 Q2 had been weaker than in the previous quarter.",
        "It was assessed that the sources of the slowdown in investment growth in the economy were difficult to identify, given the sharp rise in local government investment and the acceleration in investment activity of large enterprises.",
        "Certain Council members expressed the opinion that measuring corporate investment outlays might be hindered by changes in sources of their financing and the evolving character of the investments implemented.",
        "At the same time, it was underlined that a marked rise in export growth was recorded in 2018 Q2, making a contribution of net exports to GDP growth positive.",
        "With reference to the outlook for economic growth, it was pointed out that according to available forecasts, GDP growth in 2018 would remain relatively high and would gradually slow down in the following years.",
        "Some Council members assessed that the pace of economic growth in the quarters to come would probably be slightly weaker than in 2018 Q2.",
        "Certain of these Council members voiced the opinion that GDP growth in the coming months would be hampered by rising energy prices and supply constraints in the labour market.",
        "Other Council members, in turn, argued that GDP growth in the following quarters should be stable, and in the longer term might be higher than expected.",
        "It was assessed that the main source of risk for GDP growth forecasts was developments in the external environment of the Polish economy.",
        "While analysing current developments in the labour market, it was pointed out that employment growth continued at stable rates, while unemployment levels remained low in 2018 Q2.",
        "It was underlined that these developments were accompanied by higher wage growth than in the previous year.",
        "Yet some Council members observed that the data from both the national economy and the corporate sector confirmed that wage growth had stabilised, with no signs of further acceleration.",
        "They judged that wage growth would probably also remain at its current level in the following quarters.",
        "This was indicated by a decline in the share of firms planning pay rises and those experiencing mounting wage pressure.",
        "These Council members expressed the opinion that wage growth was being contained by the good financial situation of households and the continued inflow of foreign workers.",
        "However, other Council members pointed out that the inflow of foreign workers was diminishing, which – along with the mounting pay demands in the government sector – might contribute to a pickup in wage growth in the subsequent quarters.",
        "These members judged that any possible wage rises in the public sector and the increase in the minimum wage amid stable inflation, might put upward pressure on wage growth in the private sector.",
        "Discussing inflation developments in Poland, it was observed that the annual consumer price growth remained moderate and stayed at 2.0% in August.",
        "It was pointed out that the main factor contributing to higher prices than in the previous year was the rise in fuel prices, i.e.",
        "a factor being to a large extent beyond the direct influence of monetary policy.",
        "At the same time, inflation net of food and energy prices, while having risen somewhat in the past month, remained low, and inflation expectations of households and enterprises were stable.",
        "While discussing the outlook for price growth, it was indicated that in line with available forecasts, inflation in a one-year horizon would rise somewhat, but stay close to 2.5%.",
        "Most Council members judged that in the monetary policy transmission horizon, inflation would also remain close to the target.",
        "Certain Council members emphasised that inflation could be boosted by stronger growth of energy prices due to the significant reaction – resulting from the price policy of Polish producers – of fuel prices to increase in global oil prices, as well as the rise in costs related to the need to adapt the energy infrastructure to the EU requirements.",
        "These Council members also judged that in the following months food price growth might rise due to the drought during the summer months.",
        "Certain Council members pointed out that the enacted legislative changes and the indexation of certain benefits might also contribute to price growth in the next year.",
        "However, other Council members emphasised that the likelihood of stronger growth in inflation was limited by the good financial results of enterprises which, along with strong competition in the market, decreased the propensity of firms to raise prices.",
        "They also indicated that core inflation would rise only gradually in the following months.",
        "The Council members also stressed that no clear signs of imbalances were currently observed in the economy.",
        "It was noted that the current account balance remained close to zero, and net exports had made a positive contribution to GDP growth in 2018 Q2.",
        "It was also emphasised that credit to the non-financial sector was growing at a moderate pace, while the real lending rates remained at solidly positive levels.",
        "Some Council members assessed that the accelerated growth in lending to households, including consumer loans, resulted from households' improving financial situation, translating into better credit standing.",
        "These Council members also pointed out that the growth in housing loans was only gradual.",
        "However, certain Council members assessed that the persisting level of the reference rate – negative in real terms – might increase the risk of imbalances emerging in the economy.",
        "They pointed to the relatively fast, in their opinion, rise in consumer loans and the resulting high household debt in comparison with European countries.",
        "Other Council members considered that amid strong demand for household credit, which is characterised by higher margins, banks might be less prone to finance corporate investment activity.",
        "While discussing NBP monetary policy, the Council decided that interest rates should remain unchanged.",
        "The Council judged that current information indicated a favourable outlook for economic activity growth in Poland, despite the expected slowdown in GDP growth in the subsequent years.",
        "At the same time, in the monetary policy transmission horizon inflation would remain close to the target.",
        "As a result, the Council judged that the current level of interest rates was conducive to keeping the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic stability.",
        "The majority of the Council members expressed the opinion that, taking into account current information, the stabilisation of interest rates in the quarters to come would continue to help meet the inflation target, while supporting the maintenance of balanced economic growth, including a further recovery in investment.",
        "Moreover, these Council members pointed out that the need to take into account monetary conditions in the immediate environment of the Polish economy, as well as the heightened uncertainty about the outlook for the global economy, also spoke in favour of keeping the current level of interest rates in the coming quarters.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members, should incoming data and forecasts suggest a further increase in wage growth and a more marked intensification of inflationary pressure than currently expected, it might be justified to consider an increase in the NBP interest rates in the coming quarters.",
        "A view was also expressed that in the hypothetical event of a slump in economic activity accompanied by a marked deterioration in consumer and corporate sentiment, in the longer run it might be justified to consider a decrease in interest rates or an introduction of unconventional monetary policy instruments.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 1.50%, the lombard rate at 2.50%, the deposit rate at 0.50%, the rediscount rate at 1.75%.",
        "During the meeting, the Council discussed the impact of macroeconomic developments abroad on monetary policy in Poland.",
        "In the discussion it was pointed out that global economic conditions remained favourable, even though GDP growth in major developed economies weakened somewhat at the beginning of the year.",
        "Yet, in the assessment of the Council, this most probably was due to temporary factors.",
        "In particular, it was emphasised that GDP growth in 2018 Q1 had slowed down in the euro area.",
        "It was indicated that economic conditions had deteriorated in Germany, Poland's key trading partner, which had been partly attributable to a number of one-off factors, such as strikes related to pay negotiations or unfavourable weather conditions.",
        "In April, however, business confidence indicators in the German economy stabilised.",
        "The Council members noted that the 2018 GDP growth in the euro area as a whole should be similar to that of the previous year, while in the coming years it would gradually weaken.",
        "Likewise in the United States economic conditions remain strong, notwithstanding the fact that GDP growth in this economy also lost some momentum in 2018 Q1.",
        "In the opinion of the Council members, this was probably caused by temporary factors – like in the euro area.",
        "With reference to economic conditions in emerging economies, it was emphasised that GDP growth in China had been running at a relatively stable rate for several quarters.",
        "It was noted that uncertainty related to the United States' trade policy and the impact of geopolitical tensions were the primary risk factors to global economic growth.",
        "While analysing developments in commodity prices, a further increase in oil prices was noted.",
        "It was assessed that prices of this commodity were affected by geopolitical tensions, the current relationship between supply and demand for oil, as well as changes in the US dollar exchange rate.",
        "The expected extension of the agreement on the cap on oil production by some oil-exporting countries (so called OPEC+) was pointed out as an important factor limiting the supply of oil.",
        "In turn, a further rise in shale oil production in the United States should increase the supply of this commodity.",
        "At the same time, it was noted that high demand for oil persisted, supported by favourable global economic conditions.",
        "Certain Council members also highlighted the fact that the increasing emphasis on the protection of the natural environment in many countries added to a rise in the costs of production and transportation of oil.",
        "When discussing inflation developments in the global economy, it was observed that despite favourable global economic conditions and the rise in oil prices, inflation abroad remained moderate.",
        "It was pointed out that this reflected the continuously weak domestic inflationary pressure in many countries, as well as still lower prices of agricultural commodities than the year before.",
        "In particular, attention was drawn to a renewed decline in the euro area inflation, which despite the favourable economic conditions in Europe and the highly accommodative monetary policy of the European Central Bank, still remained well below the level compatible with the ECB's definition of price stability.",
        "In the discussion it was emphasised that the EBC was keeping interest rates close to zero, including the deposit rate below zero, and continued to purchase financial assets.",
        "At the same time, the ECB also reaffirmed its guidance to maintain interest rates at the present level even after the end of the asset purchases.",
        "The US Federal Reserve, in turn, continues to gradually reduce its balance sheet, hinting at further interest rate increases in the future.",
        "At this point, certain Council members noted that some members of the Federal Open Market Committee were concerned that the slowdown in the US economy in response to the tightening of monetary policy could be too pronounced.",
        "Other Council members emphasised that the tightening of monetary policy in the United States was accompanied by a marked easing of fiscal policy in this country.",
        "Discussing the developments in Poland’s real economy, it was observed that in line with GUS flash estimate, GDP growth amounted to 5.1% in 2018 Q1.",
        "It was pointed out that currently economic growth was supported both by increasing consumption and a recovery in investment.",
        "The continued consumption growth is supported by rising employment and wages, disbursement of benefits and very strong consumer sentiment.",
        "In turn, the increasing absorption of EU funds, favourable demand outlook as well as high capacity utilisation were conducive to the recovery in investment.",
        "At the same time, the Council members stressed that the growth rate of gross fixed capital formation was increasing steadily from quarter to quarter and that data on investment in larger enterprises showed that in 2017 expenditure on buildings and structures and on machinery, technical equipment and tools, as well as on means of transport, was higher compared to the previous year.",
        "However, certain Council members noted that the investment rate was still lower than before the global financial crisis.",
        "Some Council members judged that the stabilisation of interest rates at the current level was an important factor conducing to further growth in gross fixed capital formation in the corporate sector.",
        "Other Council members indicated that currently the cost of money is not the key factor affecting investment growth.",
        "When assessing the outlook for GDP growth, it was emphasised that economic conditions in the Polish economy remain favourable, despite the slightly weaker data on industrial and construction-assembly output in March.",
        "At the same time, it was underlined that a slight weakening in GDP growth should be expected in Poland in the coming years.",
        "While analysing the current developments in the labour market, further rise in employment and historically low level of unemployment rate were pointed out.",
        "Some Council members stressed that while wage growth was higher than in previous years, it slowed down in 2018 Q1 compared to the preceding quarter.",
        "However, other Council members emphasised that wage growth continued to exceed labour productivity growth, which was conducive to an increase in unit labour costs.",
        "Moreover, certain Council members judged that wage growth, having weakened temporarily, might pick up again in the subsequent quarters.",
        "In their opinion, this could be driven by factors such as the possible pay rise demands in the government sector and the growing shortage of qualified labour.",
        "Other Council members stressed that unit labour cost growth was moderate.",
        "These Council members were also of the opinion that the likelihood of a strong wage pressure in the government sector was small, and that the planned legal changes facilitating hiring Ukrainian citizens in Poland should support a further inflow of workers from Eastern Europe.",
        "Discussing inflation developments in Poland, it was observed that the annual consumer price growth had increased to 1.6% in April, in line with expectations.",
        "Some Council members underlined that despite favourable economic conditions and faster wage growth than in previous years, the moderate consumer price inflation was still accompanied by low inflation net of food and energy prices.",
        "These Council members also highlighted the persistently very low producer price inflation, despite the rise in global oil prices and some weakening of the zloty exchange rate over the recent past.",
        "At the same time, it was indicated that currently petrol prices were rising faster than oil prices, which – to some extent – could result from the structure of the Polish fuel market.",
        "In turn, certain Council members judged that slower price growth was supported by the ongoing shift in the structure of retail sales, involving an increasing role of discount and online stores, which enhanced price competition in this market.",
        "While discussing the outlook for price growth, it was indicated that inflation in the coming months might pick up, yet it’s yearly average would probably stand below the level envisaged in the March NBP projection.",
        "However, certain Council members pointed out that the expected pick-up in consumer price growth was to result largely from a gradual rise in core inflation, which – in their opinion – might mean a more persistent growth in inflationary pressure.",
        "These Council members also observed that the current wage growth added to a decline in profit margins, which might lead to price rises in the future.",
        "Other Council members argued that core inflation was still running below expectations, and growth in service prices, its important component, had slowed down recently.",
        "With reference to risks to the future inflation path, certain Council members observed that – besides the possible, in their opinion, rise in wage pressure – these risks included the speed and scale of pass-through of the increase in oil prices to the prices of energy carriers, as well as the impact of introducing the emission charge on fuel prices.",
        "These Council members judged that should the resulting consumer price growth prove significant, this might lead to higher inflation expectations.",
        "Other Council members pointed out that the pick-up in inflation due to oil price growth might prove temporary, so it should have neither significant nor lasting impact on inflation expectations.",
        "At the same time, some Council members emphasised that the latest central inflation forecast in Poland prepared by professional forecasters showed no risk of inflation exceeding the target in the coming years.",
        "The recent slight decline in inflation expectations of households and enterprises was also highlighted.",
        "While discussing NBP monetary policy, the Council decided that currently interest rates should remain unchanged.",
        "The Council judged that current information indicated a favourable outlook for economic activity growth in Poland, despite the expected slight slowdown in GDP growth in the subsequent years.",
        "At the same time, in line with available forecasts, in the monetary policy transmission horizon inflation will remain close to the target.",
        "As a result, the Council judged that the current level of interest rates was conducive to keeping the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic stability.",
        "The majority of the Council members expressed the opinion that, taking into account current information, the stabilisation of interest rates would continue to help meet the inflation target, while supporting the maintenance of balanced economic growth, including a further recovery in investment.",
        "Moreover, these Council members pointed out that the need to take into account the monetary conditions in the immediate environment of the Polish economy, including the likelihood of the maintenance of negative interest rates in the euro area, also spoke in favour of keeping the current level of interest rates in the coming quarters.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members, should incoming data and forecasts suggest a further increase in wage growth and a more marked intensification of inflationary pressure than currently expected, it might be justified to consider an increase in the NBP interest rates in the coming quarters.",
        "A view was also expressed that in the event of a significant decline in economic indicators accompanied by a marked deterioration in consumer and corporate sentiment, in the longer run it might be justified to consider a decrease in interest rates.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 1.50%, the lombard rate at 2.50%, the deposit rate at 0.50% and the rediscount rate at 1.75%.",
        "At the same time, the ECB stood by its announcement that interest rates would remain at their current levels, even after the end of the asset purchase programme.",
        "Certain Council members assessed inflation developments in some of the EU economies, including in Southern European countries, as an uncertainty factor for future ECB decisions.",
        "It was pointed out that the Federal Reserve continued to reduce its balance sheet, while signalling further interest rate increases in the future.",
        "It was stressed that the situation in the US labour market was a significant factor impacting the decisions of the Fed.",
        "Certain Council members assessed that the gradual tightening of monetary conditions by the Fed would lower GDP growth in the United States and lead to a deterioration of the global economic conditions.",
        "Other Council members pointed out that the impact of monetary policy tightening in the United States on the economic conditions would be contained by the loosening of fiscal policy in this country.",
        "While discussing the developments in Poland’s real economy, it was underlined that GDP growth rate in 2017 Q4 had remained close to that recorded in the previous quarter, however with the structure of growth changed.",
        "It was pointed out that the continued significant growth in consumption had been accompanied by a marked recovery in investment.",
        "It was emphasised that the pick-up in investment had taken place mainly in the public sector, although gross fixed capital formation in the corporate sector had probably increased as well.",
        "At the same time, the further growth of domestic demand boosted import growth.",
        "In turn, annual export growth – despite persistently strong external demand – decreased somewhat, partly due to seasonal factors.",
        "It was stressed that although the balance of trade had deteriorated slightly, the current account balance had remained close to zero.",
        "It was also underlined that there were no signs of rising imbalances in the domestic economy.",
        "With reference to the economic growth outlook, it was pointed out that according to the March projection, GDP growth in 2018 and 2019 would be higher than expected in November.",
        "It was emphasized that economic growth in 2018 Q1 would probably remain close to 5%, with a further recovery in investment signalled by robust growth in construction and assembly output and a rise in production of machinery and equipment in January this year.",
        "It was underlined that according to the projection, in the whole of 2018 investment growth would be faster than in the previous year.",
        "This would result from a significant increase in public investment and the expected pick-up in corporate investment, amid a favourable outlook for demand.",
        "Certain Council members emphasised that private investment was of key importance for increasing productivity and improving the competitiveness of the Polish economy.",
        "The Council members underlined that despite faster investment growth in 2018, the results of the projection had indicated a gradual decline in GDP growth in the years 2018-2020.",
        "Factors that will drag on GDP growth include the slowdown in economic activity in the environment of the Polish economy and the slightly lower domestic private consumption growth than in 2017.",
        "The Council members expressed the opinion that the external conditions of the Polish economy and labour supply developments in Poland were risk factors for the GDP growth forecast.",
        "Certain Council members assessed that GDP growth this year could be slightly lower than projected.",
        "They expressed the opinion that economic growth rate could be contained by a slowdown in exports and a decline in profitability of foreign sales related to stronger zloty than in 2017.",
        "Regarding the current developments in the labour market, attention was drawn to continued – although slower than in previous quarters – growth in employment in the economy in 2017 Q4.",
        "Some Council members underlined that the slowdown in employment growth had been mainly caused by the deepening decline of employment in agriculture, accompanied by still relatively high growth of the number of people employed in the remaining sectors of the economy.",
        "These Council members also pointed out that despite the recruitment difficulties reported by companies, employment growth in the enterprise sector had been high in 2017.",
        "They emphasised that the ability of companies to increase employment and production amid reported problems with labour supply had also been confirmed by the experience of other economies of Central and Eastern Europe.",
        "It was pointed out that rising employment in Poland was accompanied by faster wage growth in the economy, although data from the enterprise sector for January might – in the opinion of some Council members – signal a stabilisation of wage growth.",
        "Moreover, certain Council members assessed that the increase in wage growth could partly result from the rising percentage of persons employed under permanent contracts.",
        "Despite higher wage growth, the majority of the Council members judged that the labour market was not, so far, generating substantial inflationary pressure.",
        "Referring to the prospects for wage growth, attention was drawn to the stabilisation of wage growth forecast in the projection.",
        "Certain Council members emphasised that despite the expected stabilisation of wage growth, unit labour cost growth would increase in the years 2018-2019.",
        "Some Council members judged that wage growth in the coming quarters could be higher than forecast, particularly in the case of demands for wage rises in the public sector.",
        "These Council members expressed the opinion that wage growth could be increased by rising demand for labour due to the expected further recovery in investment.",
        "However, other Council members underlined that in the longer term growth in investment would lead to labour productivity growth, which would limit inflationary pressure.",
        "While discussing inflation developments in Poland, it was pointed out that annual consumer price growth had decreased at the beginning of 2018, and that core inflation net of food and energy prices remained low.",
        "In the recent period, growth of producer prices also came to a halt.",
        "Some Council members underlined that recent data confirmed that the pick-up in wage growth had no impact on price developments.",
        "Certain Council members also emphasised that price growth took place amid continued moderate lending growth.",
        "While discussing the outlook for inflation, it was indicated that according to the March projection, inflation in 2018 would be lower than earlier expected and would amount to 2.1%.",
        "In the coming years it is expected to grow gradually – to 2.7% in 2019 and 3.0% in 2020.",
        "The majority of the Council members judged that the results of the March projection indicated that in the monetary policy transmission horizon inflation would remain close to the target.",
        "However, certain Council members emphasised that the expected increase in consumer price growth resulted to a large extent from the gradual rise in core inflation.",
        "Certain Council members assessed that inflation could be higher than forecast.",
        "According to these Council members, faster price growth could be driven by higher than expected wage growth and – in view of the decreasing ability of companies to absorb rising labour costs without changing the prices of their goods – its stronger transmission to inflation.",
        "In turn, other Council members expressed the opinion that the impact of wage growth on price developments could be limited and – as a result – core inflation could be lower than forecast.",
        "Moreover, these Council members emphasised that price growth in the coming years would continue to be contained by low inflation in the environment of the Polish economy and significantly weaker forecast growth of energy prices than in previous years.",
        "While discussing NBP monetary policy, the Council decided that currently interest rates should remain unchanged.",
        "The Council judged that current data and the results of the projection indicated a favourable outlook for growth in economic activity in Poland, despite an expected slight slowdown in GDP growth in the years to come.",
        "At the same time, in line with the projection, in the monetary policy transmission horizon inflation will remain close to the target.",
        "As a result, the Council judged that the current level of interest rates was conducive to keeping the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic stability.",
        "The majority of the Council members expressed the opinion that, taking into account current information, interest rates were also likely to remain stable in the coming quarters.",
        "These Council members judged that the stabilisation of interest rates would continue to help meet the inflation target, while supporting the maintenance of balanced economic growth.",
        "Moreover, they pointed out that the need to take into account the monetary conditions in the immediate environment of the Polish economy, including the likelihood of the maintenance of negative interest rates in the euro area, also spoke in favour of keeping the current level of interest rates in the coming quarters.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members, should incoming data and forecasts suggest a further increase in wage growth and a more marked intensification of inflationary pressure than currently expected, it might be justified to consider an increase in the NBP interest rates in the coming quarters.",
        "A view was expressed that in the event of a significant decline in economic indicators accompanied by a marked deterioration in consumer and corporate sentiment, in the longer run it might be justified to consider a decrease in interest rates.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 1.50%, the lombard rate at 2.50%, the deposit rate at 0.50%, the rediscount rate at 1.75%.",
        "During the meeting, the Council noted that global economic conditions remain favourable.",
        "It was pointed out that activity in the euro area continued to be strong, despite slightly slower GDP growth than in 2017.",
        "It was assessed that the conditions for further growth of consumption in the euro area remain favourable, which should support a merely gradual slowdown in GDP growth in this region in the coming quarters.",
        "However, some Council members underlined that in the recent period growth forecasts for the euro area had been lowered, which – should it continue – could indicate the risk of a stronger slowdown in Poland's main trading partner.",
        "It was emphasised that a certain slowdown in international trade, visible in particular in weaker growth of Germany's foreign sales, was having a negative impact on GDP growth in the euro area.",
        "Certain Council members pointed out that the periodically intensifying tensions related to heavily indebted Italian economy posed an additional risk for economic conditions in Poland's immediate environment.",
        "At the same time, it was indicated that in the United States economic growth continued at a high level, due to still very good labour market conditions, high asset prices, and fiscal stimulus.",
        "When analysing changes in energy commodity prices, it was noted that they were at levels markedly higher than the year before.",
        "In the recent period, increases in the prices of oil, coal and gas had been recorded.",
        "It was pointed out that geopolitical factors continued to have a significant impact on oil prices.",
        "A further increase in these prices was supported by the expected decline in oil supply resulting from the imposition of sanctions on Iran and Venezuela, along with the lack of declaration to increase production in OPEC+ countries, as well as the growing demand for fuel as a result of the continued favourable global economic conditions.",
        "In addition, in the recent period oil prices were also affected by information about oil stocks and production in the US economy and expectations about the possible sale of oil from strategic stocks of the United States.",
        "While discussing inflation developments in the global economy, it was pointed out that the significant increase in prices of energy commodities contributed to higher inflation in many countries.",
        "However, core inflation in the environment of the Polish economy, including the euro area, remained moderate, despite the persistence of good economic conditions there.",
        "Certain Council members assessed that inflation abroad in the coming quarters could be higher than indicated by the previous forecasts.",
        "Other Council members additionally emphasised that amid heightened tensions in global trade and the introduction of tariffs by the largest economies, the disinflationary impact of globalisation on prices might be weaker than it had been so far.",
        "Referring to monetary policy in the external environment of the Polish economy, it was noted that the ECB was keeping interest rates close to zero, including the deposit rate below zero.",
        "At the same time, the ECB continued to purchase financial assets, although since October at a reduced scale, and reaffirmed its guidance to terminate the purchase programme by year-end.",
        "Some Council members judged that, should the expected economic slowdown in the euro area prove stronger than indicated by current forecasts, interest rates in this region might remain low for longer than currently signalled by the ECB.",
        "It was noted that in the United States, the Federal Reserve continued to gradually tighten monetary policy and in line with expectations had raised interest rates once again in September.",
        "Some Council members pointed out that while this could incline investors to withdraw capital from emerging market economies, the risk of a strong capital outflow from countries which enjoyed favourable economic conditions and lack of external imbalances, was limited.",
        "Certain Council members judged that the process of monetary policy tightening in the United States could be terminated earlier than currently expected.",
        "Discussing the developments in Poland’s real economy, it was emphasised that incoming data suggested that GDP growth in 2018 Q3 was still high, although somewhat lower than in the first half of 2018.",
        "Certain Council members indicated that some data on activity in the enterprise sector, including the PMI index and industrial output growth, had declined in the recent period.",
        "With reference to the outlook for economic growth, it was pointed out that according to available forecasts, GDP growth in the coming quarters would gradually decline in the wake of weakening economic growth in the environment of the Polish economy.",
        "It was stressed that GDP growth was still driven by rising consumption, fuelled by increasing employment and wages, disbursement of benefits and very strong consumer sentiment.",
        "It was highlighted that this was accompanied by growth in investment which was forecast to accelerate in 2018 Q3.",
        "It was noted that apart from public investment, fixed capital formation of private enterprises was also rising, as confirmed by data from large enterprises for 2018 Q2.",
        "While analysing current developments in the labour market, it was pointed out that the annual growth of employment in the enterprise sector was still high, although it was gradually decelerating.",
        "At the same time, the unemployment rate remained at a low level.",
        "It was underlined that these developments were accompanied by higher than in the previous year – although not accelerating – wage growth.",
        "Some Council members judged that wage growth would probably remain at its current level also in the following quarters.",
        "In their opinion, this was indicated by a decline in the share of firms planning pay rises and the moderate public sector wage growth assumed in the draft budget law, as well as the continued inflow of foreign workers.",
        "However, other Council members pointed out that the inflow of foreign workers was diminishing, which – along with the likely mounting wage demands in the government sector – might contribute to a pickup in wage growth in the subsequent quarters.",
        "Discussing inflation developments in Poland, it was observed that despite the relatively fast GDP growth, the annual consumer price growth remained moderate.",
        "According to the GUS flash estimate, in September inflation stood at 1.8% compared to 2.0% in the preceding few months.",
        "At the same time, it was emphasised that core inflation was low, while growth in producer prices had declined somewhat.",
        "Certain Council members pointed out that in the recent period households' inflation expectations had remained stable, while expectations of enterprises had risen.",
        "When discussing the outlook for price growth, it was indicated that in line with available forecasts, inflation in the first half of 2019 would be higher than currently observed.",
        "The Council members stressed that inflation would rise mainly due to higher energy prices driven by higher energy commodity prices, and also more expensive allowances for carbon dioxide emissions.",
        "In the opinion of certain Council members, the introduction of emission fees next year could also contribute to fuel price growth.",
        "An additional factor contributing to higher inflation would also be the expected higher annual growth of some food prices resulting from this year's drought.",
        "It was emphasised that the sources of higher inflation would thus include supply shocks, which at the same time would adversely affect the profitability of companies and the situation of households.",
        "In turn, core inflation was expected to rise only gradually and in the first half of 2019 should remain below the NBP inflation target.",
        "Certain Council members pointed out that the growth of energy prices might increase inflation, not only in the short term, but also in the long term.",
        "In their opinion, the need to modernise the current energy infrastructure, related i.a.",
        "to efforts aimed at diversifying energy sources, might contribute to this.",
        "In the opinion of these Council members, although energy price rises for households would probably be low in the nearest future, for enterprises they might be significant and might increase their operating costs.",
        "Moreover, certain Council members assessed that energy price increases might raise inflation expectations in the economy.",
        "However, other Council members emphasised that the likelihood of a sharp increase in inflation due to an increase in energy costs was mitigated by the strong competition among enterprises, which might increase their willingness to reduce margins or other costs in order to maintain market shares, and also by the expected slowdown in GDP growth.",
        "Referring to inflation expectations, these Council members noted that no risk of their excessive growth could be seen in the long term.",
        "The majority of the Council members judged that despite supply shocks, which could increase inflation in the first half of 2019, inflation would remain close to the target in the monetary policy transmission horizon.",
        "Some Council members underlined that in the coming years the slowdown in economic growth would curb inflation.",
        "However, certain Council members argued that the expected scale of slowdown in GDP growth was relatively small, thus it might limit inflationary pressure only to a small extent.",
        "The Council members underlined that in the Polish economy there were currently no significant external or internal imbalances.",
        "It was pointed out that the current account balance remained close to zero, and lending growth to the non-financial sector remained moderate, i.e.",
        "lower than nominal GDP growth.",
        "At the same time, some Council members stressed that although the housing market was currently in an expansion phase, housing loans were not growing at an excessive rate.",
        "Moreover, in 2018 Q2 home sales were lower than in 2018 Q1, which could mean that home prices had reached the level limiting households' demand for housing.",
        "While discussing NBP monetary policy, the Council decided that interest rates should remain unchanged.",
        "The Council judged that current information indicated a favourable outlook for economic activity growth in Poland, despite the expected slowdown in GDP growth in the subsequent quarters.",
        "At the same time, in the monetary policy transmission horizon inflation would remain close to the target.",
        "As a result, the Council judged that the current level of interest rates was conducive to keeping the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic stability.",
        "The majority of the Council members expressed the opinion that, taking into account current information, the stabilisation of interest rates in the quarters to come would continue to help meet the inflation target, while supporting the maintenance of balanced economic growth, including a further recovery in investment.",
        "Moreover, these Council members pointed out that the need to take into account monetary conditions in the immediate environment of the Polish economy, as well as the heightened uncertainty about the outlook for the global economy, also spoke in favour of keeping the current level of interest rates in the coming quarters.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members, should incoming data and forecasts suggest a further increase in wage growth and a more marked intensification of inflationary pressure than currently expected, it might be justified to consider an increase in the NBP interest rates in the coming quarters.",
        "A view was also expressed that in the hypothetical event of a slump in economic activity accompanied by a marked deterioration in consumer and corporate sentiment, in the longer run it might be justified to consider a decrease in interest rates or an introduction of unconventional monetary policy instruments.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 1.50%, the lombard rate at 2.50%, the deposit rate at 0.50%, the rediscount rate at 1.75%.",
        "During the meeting, the Council noted that global economic conditions remain favourable, although incoming data suggest a weakening in some economies.",
        "It was pointed out that in 2018 Q3 GDP growth in the euro area had softened more than expected.",
        "The slowdown in activity was particularly pronounced in the German economy, which is Poland's main trading partner.",
        "It was emphasised that economic indicators and the available forecasts suggest a further gradual slowdown in Germany as well as the whole of the euro area, while uncertainty remained about the scale of the slowing.",
        "In the United States, GDP data for 2018 Q3 confirmed that economic conditions in this country were still very strong.",
        "It was highlighted that a possible further weakening of activity in the global economy could lead to a slowdown in GDP growth in this country.",
        "While analysing the situation in the international financial markets, it was observed that heightened uncertainty about the global economic outlook persisted and continued to have an adverse effect on the prices of some assets.",
        "Fears about a global economic slowdown also lowered the prices of some commodities.",
        "Attention was drawn to the sharp falls in oil prices in the recent period, which, apart from the deterioration in the global economic outlook, was also a result of geopolitical factors and increased oil production in the United States.",
        "When discussing inflation developments abroad, it was pointed out that in many countries inflation was still elevated due to the earlier increase in energy prices.",
        "Alongside that, core inflation in the external environment of the Polish economy, including the euro area, remained moderate.",
        "Referring to monetary policy in the external environment of the Polish economy, it was noted that the ECB was keeping interest rates close to zero, including the deposit rate below zero.",
        "Concurrently, the ECB continued to purchase financial assets, although it has announced the end of the purchases by the end of the year.",
        "Some Council members judged that on account of the deterioration in the current economic conditions and the growth outlook in the euro area, interest rates there would be maintained at a very low level for an extended period of time.",
        "In the United States, the Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged in November, after another interest rate increase in September.",
        "Some Council members emphasised that in this economy too – due to the risk of a slowdown in growth as a result of a deterioration in the global economic conditions – the scale of further interest rate hikes could be smaller than earlier expected.",
        "Discussing the developments in Poland’s economy, it was underlined that preliminary GDP data for 2018 Q3 are indicative of economic conditions remaining strong.",
        "It was noted that activity growth continued to be driven by rising consumption, albeit at a slightly lower rate than in previous quarters, fuelled by increasing employment and wages, together with very strong consumer sentiment.",
        "It was underlined that in 2018 Q3 this was accompanied by a marked rise in investment resulting from both the relatively high growth in public investment – particularly on the part of local governments – and faster growth in gross fixed capital formation in large enterprises than in the first half of the year.",
        "At the same time, the marked slowdown in exports due to a deterioration in the economic conditions in the immediate environment of the Polish economy was a factor curbing the GDP growth rate.",
        "Owing to lower export growth and relatively stable growth in imports supported by strong domestic demand, the contribution of net exports to GDP growth was negative in 2018 Q3.",
        "It was noted that the adverse impact of the economic situation in the euro area on economic conditions in Poland was also confirmed by data on the financial results of Polish enterprises: in 2018 Q3 foreign sales of large companies declined.",
        "This was accompanied by an increase in sales costs of enterprises, resulting from rising wages and higher prices of some commodities than a year earlier.",
        "However, some Council members underlined that despite these negative conditions total sales of large enterprises was significantly higher than a year earlier, and their financial performance remained sound.",
        "With regard to the outlook for economic growth, it was pointed out that according to available forecasts, the rate of economic growth would gradually decline.",
        "It was indicated that the main factor adversely affecting the GDP growth rate would be the expected slowdown in the immediate environment of the Polish economy.",
        "Some Council members highlighted that growth in economic activity could additionally be curbed by an increase in production costs of enterprises, in particular, a rise in energy costs.",
        "Other Council members underlined that in the case of some enterprises, the rise in energy costs would not impact their financial situation provided the compensation announced by the government was introduced.",
        "Some Council members expressed the opinion that GDP growth in 2019 could be higher than currently forecast.",
        "While analysing current developments in the labour market, it was pointed out that unemployment remained low and the number of employed further increased.",
        "Yet some Council members judged that incoming data signalled a slowdown in growth in demand for labour.",
        "It was stressed that this was accompanied by faster wage growth than in the previous year, which however have recently been stable.",
        "Some Council members judged that wage growth would probably also continue at its current pace in the coming quarters.",
        "However, other Council members were of the opinion that wage rises for successive groups of public sector workers could be a risk factor for faster wage growth and potentially also for inflation.",
        "These Council members also judged that the likely decline in the inflow of employees from abroad would also boost wage rises the following year.",
        "Discussing inflation developments in Poland, it was observed that despite the relatively fast GDP growth and higher wage growth than last year, the annual consumer price growth remained moderate, and core inflation low.",
        "It was emphasised that according to the GUS flash estimate, inflation in November decreased more sharply than forecast.",
        "It was pointed out that the stronger than expected fall in CPI inflation was the result of not only the slowdown in food price growth, but also, probably, a fall in core inflation.",
        "Turning to the near-term outlook for inflation, it was noted that significant uncertainty existed about developments in the CPI index in 2019.",
        "This uncertainty was mainly related to energy price developments for households.",
        "At the same time, it was remarked that in 2019 inflation would probably be limited by lower oil prices than earlier forecast.",
        "Consequently, it was judged that the risk of a sharp rise in inflation in 2019 declined.",
        "Yet certain Council members expressed the opinion that the fall in global oil prices might not fully translate into a fall in domestic oil prices due to the structure of the fuel market in Poland.",
        "Some Council members also judged that inflation next year might be elevated by the rise in some administered prices, including those in public transport, as well as price rises of goods with a high share of electricity in their production costs.",
        "With reference to the medium-term outlook for inflation, the majority of the Council members judged that in the monetary policy transmission horizon inflation would remain close to the target.",
        "These Council members noted that the expected slowdown in GDP growth in the coming years would have a curbing effect on price growth.",
        "Certain Council members emphasised that the factors lowering inflation in 2019 would probably not affect price growth in the longer projection horizon.",
        "Analysing the situation in the credit market, it was pointed out that loan growth in the non-financial sector remained lower than nominal GDP growth.",
        "However, certain Council members drew attention to fast growth in household debt from consumer loans.",
        "While discussing NBP monetary policy, the Council decided that interest rates should remain unchanged.",
        "In the Council's assessment, current information indicates a relatively favourable outlook for economic conditions in Poland, although a gradual slowing in GDP growth is expected in the years ahead.",
        "In 2019, inflation might be increased by rising energy prices, i.e.",
        "a factor beyond the control of monetary policy.",
        "The scale of the energy price growth in 2019 will probably be limited by the fall in oil prices seen in recent months.",
        "In the medium term, in turn, the expected slowdown in economic growth will have a dampening effect on price growth.",
        "As a result, in the monetary policy transmission horizon inflation will remain close to the target.",
        "Thus, the Council judged that the current level of interest rates was conducive to keeping the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic stability.",
        "The majority of the Council members expressed the opinion that, taking into account current information, interest rates were also likely to remain stable in the coming quarters.",
        "These Council members pointed out that this assessment was supported by the limited risk of inflation permanently exceeding the target, along with a likely weakening of economic conditions globally and in Poland.",
        "Some Council members emphasised that currently significant uncertainty existed about developments in the CPI index in 2019.",
        "However, these Council members pointed out that should incoming data indicate a significant increase in inflation in 2019, and successive projections suggest inflation remaining above the target in the monetary policy transmission horizon, it might be justified to consider an increase in the NBP interest rates in the coming quarters.",
        "A view was also expressed that in the hypothetical event of a slump in economic activity accompanied by a marked deterioration in consumer and corporate sentiment, in the longer run it might be justified to consider a decrease in interest rates or the introduction of unconventional monetary policy instruments.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 1.50%, the lombard rate at 2.50%, the deposit rate at 0.50%, the rediscount rate at 1.75%.",
        "At the same time, the ECB stood by its announcement that interest rates would remain at their current levels even after the end of the asset purchases programme.",
        "It was pointed out that – although at its recent meeting the ECB discontinued the direct signalling of a potential increase in the size of asset purchases – it did not rule out an extension of the programme.",
        "Certain Council members underlined that after keeping interest rates at low levels for a long period, the ECB may start to raise them next year.",
        "It was observed that the Federal Reserve had increased interest rates in March and continued to gradually reduce its balance sheet.",
        "Certain Council members assessed that the tightening of monetary conditions by the Fed could lower GDP growth in the United States and lead to a deterioration in global economic conditions.",
        "Other Council members pointed out that the monetary tightening in the United States was accompanied by a marked easing of fiscal policy in this country.",
        "While discussing the developments in Poland’s real economy, it was pointed out that GDP growth in 2018 Q1 had probably remained close to that recorded in the previous quarter.",
        "It was observed that output growth was supported by two main factors: consumption demand and investment.",
        "The sustained consumption growth is underpinned by rising employment and wages, disbursement of benefits and very strong consumer sentiment.",
        "At the same time, the increasing absorption of EU funds, a favourable demand outlook and a high capacity utilization are conducive to a recovery in investment.",
        "It was pointed out that while public investment, especially local government investment, continued to be the key driver of investment growth, in 2017 Q4 this was accompanied by a rise in gross fixed capital formation in the corporate sector.",
        "In some Council members’ opinion, robust rise in the construction and assembly output in recent months was indicative of a further relatively fast growth of gross fixed capital formation in the economy in 2018 Q1.",
        "It was observed that the recovery in investment coupled with the continued rise in consumption, had contributed to accelerated import growth.",
        "At the same time, export growth – despite a recent weakening – remains relatively stable.",
        "Some Council members underlined that incoming information suggest that economic growth this year might be higher than previously expected.",
        "Certain Council members assessed that economic activity in the coming years may be exposed to risk related to the decrease in corporate profit margins, driven by rising labour costs amid the limited – given strong competition in many industries – capacity of firms to raise prices.",
        "When analysing the current developments in the labour market, further employment growth and declining unemployment rate were indicated.",
        "Some Council members underlined that while employment growth was somewhat slower than at the end of 2017, the number of persons working in the corporate sector remained relatively high in the first months of 2018.",
        "Yet other Council members argued that although the number of persons working in the entire corporate sector was still rising markedly, in some industries the possibility of increasing employment were limited.",
        "It was pointed out that while wage growth was higher than in previous years, it had not accelerated further at the beginning of the year.",
        "Some Council members emphasised that the January and February rise in wages in the corporate sector was weaker than in 2017 Q4.",
        "However, other Council members indicated that wage growth continued to exceed labour productivity growth, which was conducive to unit labour cost growth.",
        "Furthermore, certain Council members believed that following a temporary levelling, wage growth might pick up again in the coming quarters.",
        "In the opinion of those Council members, factors with a potential upward impact on wage growth included the possibility of pay rise demands in the government sector and the increasing demand for labour due to the expected further investment recovery.",
        "Other Council members, in turn, considered strong wage pressure in the government sector unlikely, since the employees in this sector attached more weight to job stability than pay level.",
        "Some Council members additionally pointed out that in the longer term investment growth would probably lead to higher labour productivity, thus weakening inflationary pressure.",
        "While discussing inflation developments in Poland, it was observed that annual consumer price growth had decreased lately and had been weaker than expected.",
        "Some Council members underlined that despite persisting good economic conditions and wage growth higher than in previous years, inflation excluding food and energy prices had declined and service price growth had slowed down.",
        "They also pointed out the near-zero growth in producer prices, and emphasised that slower price growth was accompanied by slightly lower inflation expectations, both among households and enterprises.",
        "While discussing the outlook for inflation, it was indicated that according to current forecasts, inflation in 2018 might be lower than in the March NBP projection.",
        "Yet certain Council members pointed out that the expected increase in consumer price growth was still to result largely from a gradual rise in core inflation.",
        "Certain Council members assessed that inflation in 2018 could be higher than forecast due to acceleration in wage growth expected by them.",
        "In turn, other Council members expressed the opinion that the impact of wage growth on price developments could remain limited.",
        "It was emphasised that the current rate and structure of economic growth did not lead to rising imbalances in the economy.",
        "It was pointed out that the lack of strong inflationary pressure was accompanied by the sustained trade surplus and current account balance running close to zero.",
        "It was also indicated that the annual total lending growth was still lower than the nominal GDP growth.",
        "A very good performance of the general government sector in 2017, including its decreasing deficit and debt to GDP ratio, was emphasised as well.",
        "While discussing NBP monetary policy, the Council decided that currently interest rates should remain unchanged.",
        "The Council judged that current information indicated a favourable outlook for growth in economic activity in Poland, despite an expected slight slowdown in GDP growth in the years to come.",
        "At the same time, in line with the forecasts, in the monetary policy transmission horizon inflation will remain close to the target.",
        "As a result, the Council judged that the current level of interest rates was conducive to keeping the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic stability.",
        "The majority of the Council members expressed the opinion that, taking into account current information, the probability of interest rates remaining stable in the coming quarters had increased, and the period in which they would remain at the current level might be longer than previously expected.",
        "These Council members judged that the stabilization of interest rates would continue to help meet the inflation target, while supporting the maintenance of balanced economic growth.",
        "Moreover, they pointed out that the need to take into account the monetary conditions in the immediate environment of the Polish economy, including the likelihood of the maintenance of negative interest rates in the euro area, also spoke in favour of keeping the current level of interest rates in the coming quarters.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 1.50%, the lombard rate at 2.50%, the deposit rate at 0.50%, the rediscount rate at 1.75%.",
        "During the meeting, the Council noted that global economic conditions remain favourable, although signs of a weakening had appeared in some economies.",
        "It was pointed out that GDP growth in the euro area had declined in 2018 Q3, in part probably on account of a slowdown in international trade.",
        "At the same time, it was observed that conditions for further consumption growth remained favourable in the euro area, owing to strong consumer sentiment as well as rising employment and wages.",
        "Economic conditions in the euro area also continued to benefit from the accommodative monetary policy of the ECB.",
        "However, some Council members underlined that some indicators of economic conditions, particularly in Germany – Poland's main trading partner, had deteriorated recently.",
        "In turn, economic growth in the United States had picked up slightly, what confirmed that economic conditions there were still very strong, supported by further rise in employment and the fiscal stimulus.",
        "While analysing developments in energy commodity prices, it was pointed out that despite a recent decline, they stayed markedly higher than the year before.",
        "It was noted that geopolitical factors continued to have a significant impact on oil prices.",
        "In particular, it was stressed that their recent fall resulted from a temporary relaxation of US sanctions on purchases of oil from Iran by other countries.",
        "Another factor with a dampening effect on oil prices was the rise in oil output in the United States, as well as in Saudi Arabia and other OPEC+ countries.",
        "At the same time, the growth in demand for oil, despite signs of weakening global economic conditions, remained relatively strong.",
        "When discussing inflation developments abroad, it was pointed out that the earlier significant increase in global energy commodity prices contributed to higher inflation in many countries.",
        "Alongside that, core inflation in the external environment of the Polish economy, including the euro area, remained moderate.",
        "Referring to monetary policy in the external environment of the Polish economy, it was noted that the ECB was keeping the deposit rate below zero.",
        "Concurrently, the ECB continued to purchase financial assets, although on a reduced scale since October, and reaffirmed its guidance to terminate the purchase programme by year-end.",
        "Some Council members judged that interest rates in this region might remain low for longer than currently signalled by the ECB, should the expected economic slowdown in the euro area prove stronger than indicated by the current forecasts and the rise in inflation be driven mainly by increasing energy prices, with continuously moderate core inflation.",
        "It was noted that in the United States, the Federal Reserve continued to gradually tighten monetary policy.",
        "Some Council members pointed out that the further gradual monetary policy tightening by the Fed, combined with mounting concerns about the outlook for the global economy, had recently translated into some fall in asset prices in international markets.",
        "At the same time, it was emphasised that yields on Polish Treasury bonds and the exchange rate of the zloty had remained stable, despite the deteriorating sentiment in global financial markets.",
        "In the opinion of the Council, this reflects a favourable assessment of Poland's economic situation and its fundamentals, including the absence of external and internal macroeconomic imbalances.",
        "Discussing the developments in Poland’s economy, it was underlined that incoming data indicated continuously favourable economic conditions in Poland, although GDP growth in 2018 Q3 was probably lower than in the first half of 2018.",
        "It was noted that activity growth remained to be driven by rising – albeit at a slightly lower rate than in the previous quarters – consumption, still supported by increasing employment and wages, together with very strong consumer sentiment.",
        "This was accompanied by investment growth, at a pace which had probably picked up in 2018 Q3 owing to, in particular, a significant acceleration in local government investment.",
        "However, some Council members pointed out that data for recent months – including the decline in the PMI index as well as slower growth in industrial and construction-assembly output, coupled with weaker retail sales growth – were signalling a likely gradual weakening in economic activity.",
        "With reference to the outlook for economic growth, it was pointed out that according to available forecasts, GDP growth in the coming quarters would gradually decline in the wake of weakening economic growth abroad, and slower growth of both domestic consumption and investment.",
        "Some Council members emphasised that looking ahead consumption growth would be less strongly supported by rising wage bill owing to weaker employment growth and a likely stabilisation in wage growth.",
        "Also the potential increase in electricity prices for households would probably have a downward effect on households' ability to increase their other expenditures.",
        "In turn, with regard to investment, those Council members noted that given the anticipated slowdown in activity growth abroad and in Poland, coupled with a high degree of EU fund utilisation, it was difficult to expect any further acceleration.",
        "Yet certain Council members argued that despite the expected slowdown, GDP growth was forecast to remain above 3% in the years to come.",
        "The majority of the Council members highlighted the continued uncertainty around the scale of the anticipated GDP slowdown globally, and as a consequence, also in Poland.",
        "While analysing current developments in the labour market, it was pointed out that the unemployment rate remained low and the annual growth of employment in the enterprise sector was still relatively high, although the level of employment in this sector had declined for the second consecutive month.",
        "It was underlined that this was accompanied by higher wage growth than in the previous year, however, without any further acceleration.",
        "Some Council members judged that wage growth would probably continue at its current pace also in the coming quarters, as indicated by a decline in the share of firms experiencing increasing wage pressure.",
        "According to those Council members, wage growth may also be dampened by a rise in energy prices, which increases companies' operating costs.",
        "Certain Council members, in turn, indicated that the inflow of foreign workers was declining, and in 2019 some of them could even leave the Polish labour market in response to changes in the immigration policy of Germany.",
        "This, together with the likely step-up in wage demands in the public sector, might stimulate wage growth in the subsequent quarters.",
        "However, it was stressed that the impact of the new migration policy of Germany on migration flows remained uncertain.",
        "Discussing inflation developments in Poland, it was observed that despite the relatively fast GDP growth and higher wage growth than last year, the annual consumer price growth remained moderate.",
        "According to the GUS flash estimate, in October inflation even declined.",
        "At the same time, it was emphasised that core inflation continued to be low.",
        "While discussing the near-term outlook for inflation, it was noted that significant uncertainty existed at the moment about developments in the CPI index in 2019 related, in particular, to a potential rise in the energy prices for households, whose scale is currently unknown.",
        "Some Council members highlighted that in line with current forecasts, including the results of the November NBP projection, inflation in 2019 might exceed 2.5%.",
        "It was underlined that the rise in the forecast inflation for 2019 was to be mainly driven by the assumed significant increase in electricity prices for households, stemming from the relatively high global prices of energy commodities, as well as the rise in the prices of both carbon dioxide emission allowances and the so-called green certificates and other certificates of origin.",
        "Higher energy prices may also be a result of introducing the emission charge on fuels from 2019.",
        "Core inflation, in turn, is forecast to grow only gradually, and should remain below 2.5% in 2019.",
        "The majority of the Council members stressed that given the above, higher inflation in 2019 might stem predominately from potential exogenous supply shocks that may increase price growth, while simultaneously having an adverse effect on the situation of firms and households, and thus on the pace of economic growth.",
        "With reference to the medium-term outlook for inflation, certain Council members observed that energy price growth might also act as a factor rising inflation in the coming years.",
        "Moreover, certain Council members judged that the increase in energy prices might translate into higher inflation expectations.",
        "In this context, other Council members pointed to the risk of inflation running above 2.5% over the next few years.",
        "However, most Council members emphasised that in line with the November NBP forecast – based on conservative assumptions on the scale of energy price increases – inflation should remain within a band for deviations from the NBP inflation target and, following a marked rise in 2019, would embark on a downward slope in 2020.",
        "In the opinion of these Council members, the likelihood of a persistent increase in inflation due to rising energy costs is contained by the intense competition among companies and the expected slowdown in GDP growth.",
        "Referring to inflation expectations, these Council members emphasised that no risk of their excessive growth could be seen in the longer term.",
        "While discussing NBP monetary policy, the majority of the Council members decided that interest rates should remain unchanged.",
        "In the opinion of these Council members, current information and projection results indicated a relatively favourable outlook for economic conditions in Poland, although a gradual slowing in GDP growth was expected in the years ahead.",
        "In line with the projection, inflation in 2019 will probably exceed 2.5%, boosted, among others, by a rise in energy prices remaining beyond the impact of monetary policy, but will remain within a band for deviations from the target.",
        "In the medium term, however, the expected slowdown in economic growth will have a dampening effect on inflation.",
        "As a result, in the monetary policy transmission horizon inflation will remain close to the target.",
        "Hence, the majority of the Council members judged that the current level of interest rates was conducive to keeping the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic stability.",
        "The majority of the Council members expressed the opinion that, taking into account current information, interest rates were also likely to remain stable in the coming quarters.",
        "These Council members pointed out that this assessment was supported by the limited risk of inflation permanently exceeding the target, along with a likely weakening of economic conditions globally and in Poland.",
        "Moreover, certain Council members underlined that lending growth to the non-financial sector continued to be moderate and did not create excessive inflationary pressure, while measures to limit it could additionally weaken economic activity growth.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members, should incoming data indicate a significant increase in inflation in 2019, and successive projections suggest inflation remaining above the target even after the fading of supply shocks, it might be justified to consider an increase in the NBP interest rates in the coming quarters.",
        "In the opinion of these Council members, an assessment of the rationale for raising interest rates should, in particular, include the scale and persistence of the transmission of higher energy prices on the growth of other prices and inflation expectations, as well as economic situation and labour market conditions in the quarters ahead.",
        "An argument was raised that the upward revision of the inflation forecast for the coming year, increasing the risk of inflation running above 2.5% in the longer term, spoke in favour of a rise in interest rates at the current meeting.",
        "A view was also expressed that in the hypothetical event of a slump in economic activity accompanied by a marked deterioration in consumer and corporate sentiment, in the longer run it might be justified to consider a decrease in interest rates or an introduction of unconventional monetary policy instruments.",
        "Some Council members underlined that the next projection, which will have a longer time horizon and should take into account information on the actual energy price changes at the beginning of 2019, would be important for the assessment of the medium-term outlook for inflation and economic growth.",
        "At the meeting a motion to raise the NBP interest rates by 0.25 percentage points was submitted.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 1.50%, the lombard rate at 2.50%, the deposit rate at 0.50%, the rediscount rate at 1.75%.",
        "at the reduced monthly scale.",
        "The ECB had also not modified its communication regarding future decisions.",
        "It was pointed out that this could have been caused by the recent appreciation of the euro, which increased uncertainty about the pace of the return of inflation to the ECB target.",
        "As a result, the ECB was still announcing that interest rates would remain at their current levels, even after the end of the asset purchase programme.",
        "While discussing the developments in Poland’s real economy, it was assessed that the 2017 GDP data indicated that the good economic conditions continued, accompanied by an increasingly balanced structure of economic growth.",
        "It was highlighted that growth was still driven primarily by domestic demand, including consumer demand, supported by rising employment and wages, disbursement of benefits and very good consumer confidence.",
        "Available data also signal a recovery in investment, although – as emphasised at the meeting – mainly in public investment.",
        "However, it was judged that in 2017 Q4 corporate gross fixed capital formation had probably increased as well.",
        "Moreover, regarding the structure of GDP growth, it was underlined that in 2017 growth was also driven by strong external demand reflected in a positive contribution of net exports to GDP growth in the second half of 2017.",
        "With reference to the economic growth outlook, it was assessed that an upward revision of the forecast path of GDP growth in Poland could be expected.",
        "In the opinion of the Council members, favourable economic conditions will continue in the coming quarters, although GDP growth will probably slow down slightly compared to the second half of 2017.",
        "GDP growth will continue to be supported by rising consumption, yet the statistical effects of the \"Family 500 plus\" programme will gradually fade.",
        "At the same time, a further revival in investment, including private investment, is expected.",
        "Certain Council members pointed out that private investment growth was of major significance to the competitiveness of the Polish economy.",
        "These members observed that corporate investment growth may, in particular, act as a driver of labour productivity growth in the future, which will mitigate the impact of a potential further acceleration of wages on prices.",
        "In the opinion of the Council members, domestic economic activity in the coming quarters should also be supported by favourable conditions abroad.",
        "Yet some Council members observed that in line with the forecasts of international institutions, growth in the largest economies would probably start slowing down as of the beginning of 2019.",
        "Certain Council members pointed out that the global growth outlook would, in particular, be affected by the sentiment in the global financial markets, which has recently weakened somewhat.",
        "Moreover, some Council members expressed the opinion that even amid a sustained relatively high GDP growth abroad, export growth might be hampered by the stronger exchange rate of the zloty than in the previous months.",
        "In turn, in the opinion of other Council members, the zloty exchange rate is still higher – especially against the euro – than the average export profitability exchange rate as declared by enterprises, while high import intensity of export production additionally limits its sensitivity to exchange rate movements.",
        "Referring to the developments in the labour market, it was indicated that despite the recruitment difficulties reported by some firms, employment in the corporate sector continued to rise strongly.",
        "It was pointed out that rising employment was accompanied by a further decline in unemployment and a higher wage growth.",
        "At the same time, the Council members observed that the wage freeze in the public sector was a factor constraining wage growth.",
        "Also the rise in the labour participation ratio and a further inflow of workers from the East had a dampening effect on wage growth.",
        "The majority of the Council members judged that the labour market was not, so far, generating substantial inflationary pressure, and the rise in unit labour costs in the economy remained moderate.",
        "Yet certain Council members indicated the rising number of enterprises with wages growing faster than labour productivity.",
        "Furthermore, these Council members argued that in the coming quarters wage pressure might increase, as there was a risk of wage demands arising in the public sector, and – after the lowering of the statutory retirement age – further retirements of a substantial part of eligible employees.",
        "Other Council members, however, underlined that the impact of retirements on labour supply had so far been limited due to the high proportion of non-working persons among those retiring, and a probability that many retired employees would remain active in the labour market.",
        "While analysing inflationary developments in Poland, it was pointed out that the annual consumer price growth had decreased at the end of 2017 and that core inflation net of food and energy prices remained low.",
        "Some Council members emphasised that core inflation in 2017 Q4 had been running below the level envisaged in the November NBP projection, despite higher than expected GDP growth.",
        "Weaker growth of producer prices was also pointed out.",
        "The majority of the Council members were of the opinion that inflationary pressure remained limited.",
        "Referring to the outlook for inflation, it was observed that moderate price growth in the external environment of the Polish economy and the stronger zloty than in the previous year would continue to have a curbing effect on price developments.",
        "The majority of the Council members judged that in the light of current information inflation in the next two years would be running close to the inflation target.",
        "Certain Council members argued that hitherto inflation might had been dampened by the structural changes increasing price competitiveness in retail trade.",
        "These Council members believed, however, that the role of this factor might weaken in the future.",
        "At the same time, these Council members pointed to the likely upward revision of the expected inflation path in the coming years.",
        "While discussing NBP monetary policy, the Council decided that currently interest rates should remain unchanged.",
        "The Council judged that despite accelerated economic growth inflation in Poland was still running at moderate rates.",
        "As a result, the current level of interest rates is conducive to keeping the Polish economy on the sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic stability.",
        "The majority of the Council members expressed the opinion that, taking into account current information, interest rates were also likely to remain stable in the coming quarters.",
        "These Council members judged that the stabilisation of interest rates would continue to help meet the inflation target, while supporting the balanced economic growth, including the expected further recovery in investment.",
        "Moreover, these Council members pointed out that the need to take into account the monetary conditions in the immediate environment of the Polish economy, including the likelihood of the maintenance of negative interest rates in the euro area, also spoke in favour of keeping the current level of interest rates in the coming quarters.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members, should data and forecasts incoming in the following quarters suggest a more marked intensification of inflationary pressure than currently expected, it might be justified to consider an increase in the NBP interest rates in the quarters to come.",
        "It was also pointed out that the March projection of inflation and GDP would be an important prerequisite for an assessment of the outlook for monetary policy.",
        "A view was expressed that in the event of a significant decline in economic indicators accompanied by a marked deterioration in consumer and corporate sentiment, in the longer run it might be justified to consider a decrease in interest rates.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 1.50%, the lombard rate at 2.50%, the deposit rate at 0.50%, the rediscount rate at 1.75%."

    "2011": [
        "At the meeting, the Monetary Policy Council discussed the situation in the external environment of the Polish economy, the outlook for economic growth and inflation in Poland as well as the situation in the domestic labour market, including the risk of second round effects.",
        "While assessing the external environment of the Polish economy, it was pointed out that activity growth in the global economy was stable.",
        "Yet, it was emphasized that uncertainty about its outlook remained high, and in the recent period was further exacerbated by the events in Japan, North Africa and the Middle East.",
        "Some members of the Council also indicated that recovery in many developed economies continued to be sluggish, and activity growth in the United States might not be maintained at the current, relatively high, level as it was largely supported by significant monetary stimulation.",
        "At the same time, attention was paid to a rapid GDP growth in emerging economies and in Germany, and emphasis was given to the strong business cycle synchronization between the Polish and German economies.",
        "Some members of the Council also indicated that inflation remaining at a heightened level in emerging economies was accompanied by signs of growing inflationary pressures in developed economies.",
        "Those members pointed out that the central banks in many emerging economies and in some small open developed economies increased their interest rates considerably, and that the European Central Bank was likely to embark on monetary policy tightening in the coming period.",
        "Yet, other members of the Council emphasized that even after an increase the ECB's interest rates, similarly to other major central banks’ interest rates, would remain at a low level.",
        "At the same time, some members of the Council assessed that likely continuation of the accommodative monetary policy in some major developed economies would act towards sustained high global liquidity, and, consequently, increased global inflationary pressure.",
        "While discussing commodity prices in the world markets it was assessed that intensified activity of short-term investors in these markets contributed to the growth of these prices.",
        "In the opinion of some members of the Council this was indicative of a temporary character of commodity price increases and the coming months might be expected to bring a fall of these prices.",
        "According to those members of the Council, such an assessment is supported also by forecasts of improved supply conditions in the agricultural commodity markets in 2011.",
        "Other members of the Council assessed, however, that the rise in commodity prices was to a large extent driven also by growing demand from emerging economies, which indicates that despite possible temporary fluctuations in those prices due to the changing level of short-term investor activity in commodity markets the upward trend of these prices would continue.",
        "With regard to the outlook for economic growth in Poland, some members of the Council pointed out that GDP growth in 2011 and in subsequent years was most likely to be close to, or slightly higher than, that recorded in 2010.",
        "It was assessed that GDP growth would be supported by growing external demand and a rise in domestic demand would mainly be driven by rising household consumption, supported by growing employment.",
        "Other members of the Council emphasized, on the other hand, that in the absence of recovery in corporate investment and in view of the likely weakening of infrastructure investments co-financed with EU funds, as well as in the face of the anticipated fiscal policy tightening, economic growth might be expected to slow down in subsequent years.",
        "It was also pointed out that  growing commodity prices in the global markets might also be conducive to lower growth in investment and consumption.",
        "With regard to the prospects for recovery in investment, some members of the Council assessed that corporate investment growth might be faster than currently expected, as suggested by: the growth in gross fixed capital formation in large enterprises in 2010 Q4, very good financial, including liquidity, situation of enterprises and steadily growing production capacity utilization, now exceeding the longterm average.",
        "Yet, some members of the Council emphasized that the degree of production capacity utilization in Poland continued to be moderate compared to other EU countries.",
        "Members of the Council also pointed at the continuing downward trend in construction and assembly production at the beginning of 2011 and the decline in the indicator of new investment in the enterprises survey.",
        "It was pointed out that continuing uncertainty about the future economic situation was a factor behind enterprises’ lower propensity to invest.",
        "While addressing the developments in individual consumption, some members of the Council assessed that its acceleration at the end of 2010 was not only due to advance purchases of certain goods in response to the expected changes in taxation starting from January 2011.",
        "In the opinion of those members of the Council this conclusion was suggested by the data on retail sales at the beginning of 2011.",
        "Yet, some members of the Council highlighted that monthly data on retail sales were highly volatile whereas high growth in retail sales in February 2011 resulted partly from a statistical base effect.",
        "While discussing the situation in the labour market, some members of the Council assessed that the data released recently mitigate the risk of rapid build-up of wage and inflationary pressure.",
        "In particular, those members pointed at wage growth in enterprises slowing down at the beginning of 2011 and high unemployment level persisting as a result of a relatively rapid rise in the number of the economically active.",
        "At the same time, however, the uncertainty regarding the impact of the opening up of the labour market in Germany on labour supply in Poland was emphasized.",
        "Those members also pointed out that amidst the falling number of job offers, the labour market tensions indicator (number of job offers per one unemployed) was now at its lowest level in five years.",
        "Other members of the Council emphasized, however, that the decline in the number of job offers was driven mainly by the falling number of subsidized job offers which was not a good indicator of labour demand developments in the economy.",
        "Those members also pointed at the continuing relatively high employment growth in enterprises.",
        "While discussing the developments in CPI inflation and its outlook, it was emphasized that its heightened level was mainly related to the growing prices of agricultural and energy commodities in the global markets, which had not been offset by changes in the zloty exchange rate, and – to a markedly lesser degree – by a rise in VAT rates.",
        "Some members of the Council pointed at a risk of inflation continuing to run above the upper limit for deviations from the NBP inflation target in 2011.",
        "Some members of the Council, on the other hand, assessed that following its temporary rise, inflation would fall markedly in the second half of 2011.",
        "At the same time, in the opinion of the majority of members of the Council, the risk of intensifying inflationary pressure resulting from the excessive demand growth was currently limited.",
        "Yet, some members of the Council pointed at the uncertainty regarding the potential output estimates and indicated at the risk of positive output gap being higher than in the March projection of inflation and GDP.",
        "Some members of the Council emphasized that also a possible increase in wage pressure, driven by heightened inflation expectations could be conducive to a rise in inflation.",
        "In the opinion of those members of the Council, a marked rise in inflation expectations of both individuals and enterprises in the recent period was indicative of a higher risk of intensifying wage demands and their translation into wage growth, especially in view of a very good financial condition of enterprises.",
        "They pointed that the share of enterprises planning to increase wages in 2011Q2 was the highest in ten quarters.",
        "At the same time, some members of the Council emphasized that amidst heightened inflation expectations enterprises might show more propensity to shift higher costs to product prices.",
        "Other members of the Council, on the other hand, pointed out that the risk of second round effects in a situation of high unemployment was uncertain.",
        "They emphasized that this risk was also reduced by the limited role of labour unions in the Polish economy.",
        "With regard to the developments in loan aggregates, some members of the Council assessed that a rise in lending to the private sector was moderate and was not a factor behind higher demand pressure in the economy.",
        "Those members paid particular attention to the fact that the growth in housing loans weakened at the beginning of 2011 and investment loans to enterprises showed a low growth rate.",
        "A slump in consumer loans was also pointed out, yet it was emphasized that this was due to the banks’ tightening their lending policies in response to worsening credit quality and regulatory changes.",
        "Other members of the Council assessed, on the other hand, that the growth in housing loans remained strong as compared to the growth in disposable income achievable under price stability.",
        "They also stressed that the low growth of corporate lending was connected with very good liquidity situation of enterprises and low level of investment activity.",
        "While discussing the situation in the public finance sector, some members of the Council emphasized that in 2011 the expansionary fiscal policy would be continued which, in their opinion, required a tighter monetary policy.",
        "Other members of the Council assessed, however, that in the face of the anticipated tightening of fiscal policy in 2011 it was not a factor justifying interest rate hikes.",
        "At the same time, the uncertainty about the scale and structure of fiscal tightening in the coming years was emphasized.",
        "While addressing the zloty exchange rate developments, some members of the Council assessed that a rise in the interest rate differential would support the appreciation of the zloty.",
        "Other members of the Council emphasized, however, that the impact of a higher differential on the exchange rate might be limited by the risk of revision of the current account deficit estimates, the uncertainty related to parliamentary elections and the continuing fiscal risk in some euro area countries.",
        "The Council discussed the scale and pace of monetary policy tightening.",
        "Some members of the Council assessed that fast interest rate increases would constitute a more effective measure of curbing inflation expectations than gradual tightening of monetary policy.",
        "They also emphasized that a quicker ending of the cycle of interest rate increases would mitigate the uncertainty in the financial markets and could support the appreciation of the exchange rate of the zloty.",
        "Other members of the Council argued, however, that amidst persisting heightened uncertainty about the outlook for economic growth and inflation in the domestic and global economy, continuation of the gradual tightening of monetary policy was justified.",
        "While analyzing the decision about changing the interest rates at the current meeting, some members of the Council represented the view that persisting uncertainty about the prospects of activity growth in the Polish economy and its environment justified keeping the interest rates unchanged.",
        "Yet, the majority of the Council members argued that a marked rise in inflation expectations combined with a strong growth in commodity prices in the global markets created, in a situation of continuing economic recovery, a risk of persisting heightened inflation.",
        "In order to contain the risk of inflation running above the inflation target in the medium term, it is justified to continue the cycle of monetary policy tightening and increase interest rates at the present meeting of the Council.",
        "Some members of the Council also indicated that the low level of real interest rates connected with inflation and, as a result, inflation expectations running at a heightened level was another argument in favour of interest rate increases.",
        "A motion to raise the NBP interest rates by 25 basis points was put forward at the meeting.",
        "The Council decided to increase the interest rates to the following levels: reference rate to 4.00%, lombard rate to 5.50%, deposit rate to 2.50% and rediscount rate to 4.25%.",
        "At its meeting, the Monetary Policy Council discussed the impact of external developments on the situation in the Polish economy, the present and future trends in domestic economic activity, the likely shape of fiscal policy in the coming year as well as the outlook for inflation’s return to the target.",
        "In this context, the Council discussed the current and possible future monetary policy decisions.",
        "While addressing conditions in the external environment of the Polish economy, Council members highlighted the recent signs of a further weakening of economic activity in the United States, the euro area and in some emerging market economies, particularly in China.",
        "It was pointed out that the deteriorating outlook for global economic growth was reflected in the fact that international financial institutions considerably downgraded GDP growth forecasts for major advanced and developing economies.",
        "The weaker outlook for global economic activity combined with the fiscal problems of some euro area countries resulted in higher risk aversion in the international financial markets, leading, as a consequence, to a depreciation in the exchange rates of emerging market currencies, including the zloty.",
        "While discussing the longer-term outlook for the global economy, some Council members highlighted the fact that the reduction of private sector debt is a significant challenge currently facing economic policy in the United States, while in the euro area the challenge is to solve the sovereign debt crisis.",
        "These Council members maintained that given the above one may expect a protracted economic slowdown in both economies.",
        "Some Council members pointed out, however, that due to the structural differences between these economies the United States will see a recovery sooner than the euro area.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members, in the longer term weaker economic activity can also be expected in China, where the limited possibilities of further export growth mean that domestic demand’s role will have to increase, which, considering demographic factors and the absence of a social security system, will be difficult.",
        "All in all, according to those Council members, the debt crisis, and, in the longer term, the structural factors (mainly of demographic nature), may result in a prolonged period of slower growth of the global economy.",
        "Growth may also be less stable, especially given the limited options to stabilize the economy.",
        "Moreover, in this context some members of the Council highlighted the strongly expansionary monetary policy conducted by the major central banks as an additional drag on economic growth in the developed countries in the longer term.",
        "In the opinion of those members, such a policy delays the restructuring of these economies by hampering an effective re-allocation of resources.",
        "While assessing the situation in the Polish economy, some Council members underlined the fact that despite its relatively sound fundamentals, the expected deterioration of external economic conditions – mainly in the euro area, including, in particular, in Germany – increases the risk of slower growth of Polish exports, and, hence, of slower GDP growth in the coming quarters.",
        "In the opinion of these Council members, despite a larger resilience of the Polish financial system in comparison to the other countries of the region, the links between financial systems in Europe may amplify the negative impact of external developments on economic activity in Poland.",
        "However, other members of the Council argued that despite markedly slower economic growth in the euro area, Polish exports have been rising relatively fast.",
        "Therefore, it may be expected that domestic GDP growth will not slow down significantly amidst an expected deterioration in the external environment of the Polish economy.",
        "While discussing economic activity in Poland, some Council members pointed to August 2011 data showing a marked increase in corporate deposits and somewhat slower lending to this sector, which may signal that enterprises’ propensity to invest is decreasing in a situation of a deteriorated outlook for domestic growth.",
        "With regard to the impact of developments in the public finance sector on economic growth in Poland, some Council members pointed to the likely significant reduction of the sector’s deficit in 2011 and to the announcements of continued fiscal tightening in 2012.",
        "In this context, it was pointed out that although a further reduction of fiscal imbalances will hamper GDP growth in the short term, abandoning it would be viewed negatively by financial markets, which would increase both the cost of public debt servicing and the risk of macroeconomic destabilization.",
        "Some Council members emphasized that the way in which fiscal imbalances are contained is important.",
        "If it is to be achieved by limiting expenditure, it may contribute to increasing the propensity of enterprises to invest by reducing concerns about a future rise in the tax burden and by easing the wage pressure.",
        "According to other Council members, fiscal tightening in 2012 may be significantly smaller than this year and smaller than that assumed by the government in the state’s Multi-year financial plan.",
        "While discussing current data on inflationary processes in Poland, Council members pointed to the rise in both CPI and core inflation in August 2011.",
        "Some Council members also emphasized the concurrent acceleration in producer prices and faster-than-expected wage growth in the enterprise sector as factors that may signal higher-than-anticipated inflation in the future.",
        "On the other hand, the persistently elevated unemployment rate and the weaker growth of household disposable income were mentioned as factors conducive to curbing inflationary pressure.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members, the somewhat slower growth of lending to the private sector in August 2011 may also point to the absence of mounting inflationary pressure.",
        "The Council members argued that in light of the NBP’ internal short-term forecasts one may expect heightened inflation till the end of the year, followed by inflation’s return close the NBP inflation target in the first half of 2012.",
        "This will be facilitated by the subsiding effects of earlier rises in food and energy prices as well as the VAT increase at the beginning of 2011, despite the forecasted concurrent sustained fast growth in administered prices.",
        "It was emphasized that the easing of inflationary pressure in the coming quarters will be fostered by an expected decrease in GDP growth amidst monetary policy tightening implemented in the first half of 2011 and the ongoing tightening of fiscal policy, as well as the expected weakening of economic activity in the external environment of the Polish economy.",
        "In the context of the inflation outlook, it was also pointed out that the latest results of business activity surveys show that the number of enterprises intending to reduce employment is larger than that of enterprises that intend to increase it, and that the percentage of enterprises planning to increase wages has fallen, which suggests that that wage pressure in the economy remains limited.",
        "At the same time, Council members indicated that considering the persisting tensions in international financial markets the weakening of the zloty exchange rate may be an important risk factor for the fall of CPI inflation to the inflation target.",
        "Some Council members emphasised that if there was a slump in economic activity abroad, the zloty might depreciate further, which would keep inflation at an elevated level, despite a slowdown of domestic GDP growth.",
        "Some Council members also indicated that high inflation expectations of individuals may jeopardise the decline in inflation.",
        "Although in the past these expectations were strongly adaptive and they decreased in August 2011, they have remained above the inflation target most of the time since the end of 2007.",
        "While discussing the NBP interest rates, the Council members agreed that these should remain unchanged.",
        "Arguments in support of this stance included the expected decline in inflation in Poland, particularly in the context of a weakening outlook for growth in the global economy, and, as a consequence, also in Poland.",
        "It was also indicated that currently the main risk factor for price stability in Poland is the impact of the unstable situation in international financial markets on the zloty exchange rate.",
        "Some Council members emphasized that the NBP interest rates may now be maintained at a lower level than would be justified before the global financial crisis.",
        "In their opinion, this is the effect of, on the one hand, the existing financial market frictions increased by the crisis, and, on the other hand, the probable decline in factor productivity growth leading to a decline in the natural rate of interest.",
        "While discussing future monetary policy the Council was of the opinion that given the currently expected macroeconomic scenario which assumes some economic slowdown and a concurrent gradual decline in inflation, the interest rates could remain at the present level in subsequent quarters.",
        "It was indicated that the stabilisation of monetary policy parameters is conducive, particularly given increased uncertainty, to maintaining macroeconomic stability.",
        "At the same time some Council members argued, however, that in subsequent quarters the likelihood of interest rate increases is larger than that of interest rate cuts, especially if inflation – due to the depreciation of the zloty triggered by the turmoil in the international financial markets – remains above the target for a period longer than currently anticipated.",
        "Some Council members indicated that a potentially significant slowdown of GDP growth in Poland in response to significantly weaker economic activity abroad may, given the expected decline in inflation, justify a reduction of the NBP interest rates at some point in the future.",
        "The Council also discussed the long-term challenges to economic policy.",
        "The Council members pointed to the need to take measures aimed at enhancing macroprudential policy, including the development by the central bank and other institutions responsible for the financial system of new instruments mitigating systemic risk in the financial sector.",
        "The need to coordinate regulatory and macroeconomic policies in order to maintain macroeconomic stability, including the stability of the financial system, was also emphasized.",
        "The Council kept the interest rates unchanged at the following levels: reference rate at 4.50%, Lombard rate at 6.00%, deposit rate at 3.00%, rediscount rate at 4.75%.",
        "At its meeting, the Monetary Policy Council discussed the external environment of the Polish economy and the outlook for economic growth and inflation in Poland.",
        "In this context, the Council discussed the current and future monetary policy decisions.",
        "While discussing the external environment of the Polish economy, the Council pointed to weak GDP growth in the euro area in 2011 Q3 and high probability of recession affecting the euro area economy in the subsequent quarters, which might be driven by the problems connected with the sovereign debt crisis.",
        "In the United States, in turn, GDP growth in 2011 Q3 accelerated slightly.",
        "In the opinion of some members of the Council, the US economy could be gradually returning to equilibrium, albeit at higher unemployment rate and weaker potential output growth.",
        "At the same time it was emphasized that despite relatively sound economic conditions, the probable recession in the euro area could also translate into a slowdown in economic activity in the United States.",
        "With regard to the euro area sovereign debt crisis, members of the Council pointed out that mere announcements of economic reforms including, in particular, the tightening and coordination of fiscal discipline in the euro area, if not supported with rapid adjustments, might be insufficient to improve financial market sentiment.",
        "It was highlighted that worsening sentiment in the global economy, largely triggered by the euro area crisis and the accompanying tensions in the financial markets, had been translating into the zloty depreciation observed in recent months.",
        "Some members of the Council assessed that the resulting higher price competitiveness of domestic output would contain the deceleration in the growth of Polish exports stemming from the anticipated global economic slowdown, particularly in the euro area.",
        "The weaker zloty coupled with worsening price competitiveness of imports would be conducive to higher growth of domestic output and improvement in Poland’s current account balance.",
        "At the same time, members of the Council indicated that, since a large share of Polish corporate debt was foreign held, depreciation of the zloty would deteriorate the financial account of the balance of payments.",
        "Depreciation of the zloty would also result in higher value of domestic debt denominated in foreign currencies which, especially in the case of households, might exacerbate difficulties with debt repayment.",
        "This would, in consequence, lead to deteriorating banking sector conditions and curb credit supply.",
        "Some members of the Council also highlighted the risk of Poland facing elevated capital outflows, driven by the euro area crisis and unfavourable capital position of European banks, and, as a result, limited credit supply to Polish entities.",
        "Other members of the Council argued, however, that weaker economic growth would lead to lower credit demand.",
        "Some members of the Council pointed out that in the case of improving sentiment in the global financial markets gradual appreciation of the zloty was possible, given “undervaluation” of the zloty and the expected reduction of both external imbalance (i.e.",
        "improving current account balance) and domestic imbalance (i.e.",
        "narrowing public finance deficit) of the Polish economy.",
        "It was noted, however, that amid shocks abroad and growing risk aversion that would increase risk premium, volatility of the zloty might remain elevated.",
        "0 0-919\nWhile analysing current situation in Poland, it was pointed out that the GDP data for 2011 Q1 confirmed that relatively high growth had been sustained in that period.",
        "Some members of the Council also assessed that the anticipated deceleration in economic growth in Poland would be largely due to growing uncertainty triggered by external factors.",
        "In their opinion, it was supported by business condition surveys that pointed to a relatively high capacity utilization.",
        "Against this background, some members of the Council noted that concerns about the impact of the current crisis on domestic economic developments in the coming quarters affected considerably stronger business activity than consumers’ behaviour, as could be concluded from persistent high growth of retail sales.",
        "As regards the outlook for economic growth in Poland, the members of the Council assessed that despite slight slowdown in GDP growth anticipated for 2012, the growth rate would remain relatively high, especially against significant slowdown in the global economy.",
        "Some members of the Council also indicated that GDP growth in 2012 might exceed 3% in year-on-year terms, with private consumption being an important factor supporting it.",
        "In the opinion of some members of the Council, the key risk to GDP growth would be private investment growth, with the scope of public investment co-financed with the EU funds likely to diminish.",
        "While discussing inflation developments in Poland, it was pointed out that the currently observed heightened inflation was mainly driven by factors beyond the direct impact of domestic monetary policy decisions, i.e.",
        "high commodity prices in the global markets, depreciation of the zloty stemming from growing risk aversion in the global financial markets and a rise in administered prices.",
        "The first two of these factors were reflected in high PPI growth.",
        "Some members of the Council also indicated that inflation remaining markedly above the target for a longer time was not conductive to anchoring inflation expectations.",
        "This, in turn, was reflected in both the worsening perception of inflation and response structure of individuals to the surveys questions on inflation expectations.",
        "Factors behind increasing inflation, albeit to a lesser extent, also included demand pressure, stemming mostly from continued relatively high growth of private consumption, translating into rising core inflation.",
        "At the same time, some members of the Council pointed to the labour market conditions, in particular to persistently high unemployment rate, declining employment in the corporate sector and moderate wage growth, which contained cost pressure, and, consequently, inflationary pressure.",
        "Some members of the Council were of the opinion that inflation was likely to return to the target in the second half of 2012.",
        "Among other factors contributing to lower inflation some members of the Council indicated a rise in saving rate in the enterprise sector.",
        "In the opinion of the Council, the key factor containing inflationary pressure in the coming quarters would be a weaker GDP growth, stemming from slower global economic growth.",
        "The members of the Council were also of the opinion that lower domestic activity would additionally result from further fiscal tightening.",
        "Yet, as regards the impact of fiscal tightening on inflation, some members of the Council assessed that its structure might boost inflation in the short term, as it would largely consist of rises in tax burdens.",
        "At the same time, further pass-through of the zloty depreciation observed over the past few months into domestic prices, coupled with inflationary expectations unanchored at the target level, posed, in the opinion of some members of the Council, the risk of inflation persisting at a heightened level.",
        "The Council also pointed to the expected rise in administered prices, excise tax and charges imposed by local governments in 2012, as factors prolonging the return of inflation to the target.",
        "While discussing the NBP interest rates, the Council agreed they should remain unchanged.",
        "When justifying the decision, the Council pointed to the currently high uncertainty regarding economic activity and inflation developments both in global and domestic markets.",
        "This made it difficult to explicitly assess the probability of inflation remaining above or below the target over the period of the strongest impact of monetary policy on the economy.",
        "Moreover, some members of the Council argued that stabilization of monetary policy parameters is conducive, particularly given increased uncertainty, to maintaining macroeconomic stability.",
        "In the opinion of some members of the Council, current inflation persisting at a heightened level and a relatively long period of its expected return to the target might be supportive of an increase in the NBP interest rates.",
        "On the other hand, however, the likely global and domestic economic slowdown, should be easing inflationary pressure in the medium term.",
        "In these circumstances, in the opinion of some members of the Council, the tightening of monetary policy might additionally weaken domestic economic growth and increase the risk of inflation remaining below the target in the long run.",
        "While discussing future monetary policy, some members of the Council upheld their assessment that the persisting relatively balanced risks to the future inflation justify stabilization of interest rates at present level in the following quarters.",
        "The macroeconomic scenario they expected assumed smooth slowdown in economic growth along with a gradual decline in inflation.",
        "Yet, according to some members of the Council, it might be justified to tighten monetary policy in the future.",
        "In their opinion, this would be due to a high probability of inflation remaining at a heightened level in the coming quarters despite the expected slowdown in economic growth, as supported by lower responsiveness of inflation to the negative output gap, stronger exchange rate pass-through on inflation amidst large and one-directional exchange rate fluctuations and a relatively strong rise in money supply.",
        "Some members of the Council, however, highlighted macroeconomic scenarios justifying future reduction in the interest rates.",
        "In their opinion, this would be advisable amidst strong slowdown in economic growth combined with inflation declining to the target.",
        "The Council kept the NBP interest rates unchanged at the following levels: reference rate at 4.50%, lombard rate at 6.00%, deposit rate at 3.00%, rediscount rate at 4.75%.",
        "At its meeting, the Monetary Policy Council discussed the external environment of the Polish economy, present and future trends in domestic economic activity as well as the outlook for inflation returning to the target, also in the light of the NBP’s November projection.",
        "In this context, the Council discussed the current and future monetary policy decisions.",
        "While addressing the situation in the external environment of the Polish economy, the Council highlighted that although some current data for the United States and the euro area turned out to be better than expected, business conditions indicators pointed to weaker economic activity ahead.",
        "This was reflected in further downward revisions of GDP growth forecasts for major economies prepared by international institutions.",
        "At the same time some Council members emphasised that the resolution of the debt crisis in the euro area would be a long-lasting process, difficult in economic, political and institutional terms.",
        "Some Council members assessed that the euro area would probably see a considerable and prolonged decline in GDP growth, resulting, among other factors, from fiscal tightening in many countries of the region, which would tend to weaken economic activity in Poland.",
        "These members pointed out that domestic growth might be particularly strongly affected, through a decline in Poland's foreign trade, by slower growth in Germany.",
        "Other Council members argued, however, that in spite of the expected significant economic slowdown abroad, Polish exports were likely to continue rising relatively fast, taking into account, among other things, the improved price competitiveness of Polish products due to the zloty depreciation observed in the past few months.",
        "Thus, in the opinion of these members, economic growth in Poland is not likely to see any considerable slowdown.",
        "At the same time, a few members of the Council argued that the crisis in the euro area would have an impact on the Polish economy not only through a possible decline in the demand for Polish exports, but also through a possible decline in the supply of loans granted by foreign-owned domestic banks which, in line with the recommendations of the euro area summit, would strive to improve their capital situation.",
        "Some Council members argued, however, that business operations of domestic banks generated considerable profits for their foreign owners, and hence the risk of significant lending constraints was not great.",
        "While addressing the euro area sovereign debt crisis-related tensions persisting in the European financial markets, and, in particular, the situation in the European banking system, it was indicated that these were likely to result in an outflow of capital from emerging markets, including those of Central and Eastern Europe and Poland.",
        "At the same time attention was paid to Poland's relatively volatile exchange rate.",
        "Some Council members also emphasized the fact that the zloty was currently relatively weak and might be expected to return to an appreciation trend if the situation in the financial markets stabilised.",
        "While discussing the external conditions of economic activity in Poland, members of the Council pointed to the developments in global commodity prices, particularly the prices of energy commodities.",
        "It was emphasised that despite expectations of a material deterioration in business conditions abroad, there were no signs of any significant decline in these prices, which contributed to elevated inflation worldwide.",
        "Some members of the Council argued that high commodity prices were driven by long-term factors, i.e.",
        "continued significant demand, particularly from emerging economies, amidst a limited increase in supply expected over the next few years.",
        "Other members of the Council expressed the opinion that the elevated level of commodity prices was supported by considerable surplus liquidity in the financial markets related to the expansionary monetary policy continued by major central banks.",
        "With respect to the monetary policy pursued by major central banks, a few members of the Council also pointed to the fact that inflation was running high at the moment - especially in the United States and in the euro area - and the current and possible further monetary expansion could translate into a lasting increase in inflation in the external environment of the Polish economy.",
        "As regards the assessment of the economic situation in Poland, it was emphasized that data on industrial production, construction and assembly output and retail sales proved better than expected and signalled a relatively good situation in the domestic economy.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that although subsequent quarters might bring an economic slowdown, as suggested by most forecasts, including the NBP’s November projection, economic growth in the coming quarters might be faster than currently forecast owing to Polish companies’ considerable resilience to the crisis abroad.",
        "In the opinion of some members of the Council, the sound financial condition of enterprises, high competitiveness of Polish goods in the global markets and a stable banking system were additional factors supporting GDP growth in Poland.",
        "A few members of the Council also pointed to externally-driven heightened uncertainty about further developments in the domestic economy which makes it possible for Polish GDP growth in the years 2012-2013 to be stronger as well as weaker than assumed in the projection.",
        "In the opinion of a few members of the Council, the shape of the government’s post-electoral economic programme is also an uncertainty factor.",
        "Other members of the Council also pointed to certain signs which might indicate a slowdown in domestic economic activity, including, in particular, investment activity.",
        "While discussing inflationary developments it was pointed out that a further drop in food prices had translated into lower inflation in September, but until the end of the year inflation might be expected to remain markedly above the upper limit for deviations from the inflation target.",
        "Some members of the Council emphasized that – in line with most forecasts – at the beginning of 2012 the waning impact of the VAT rate increase and the considerable rises in food and energy prices in the first half of 2011 would translate into a decline in the annual inflation rate, but in line with the NBP’s November inflation projection the second half of 2012 might see inflation rise again.",
        "It was indicated that the zloty exchange rate continued to be a risk factor for inflation’s lasting return close to the target.",
        "According to Council members, apart from the depreciation of the zloty, other factors driving up prices included the recent surge in fuel prices and an acceleration of PPI which might, with a certain time lag, affect consumer goods prices.",
        "A few members of the Council also pointed to the risk of higher than currently expected rises in administered prices, including a possible further increase in energy prices driven by the implementation of the EU Climate and Energy Package in Poland, which, combined with a relatively high, i.e.",
        "above the long-term average, core inflation level anticipated in the NBP’s November projection, might contribute to extending the period of heightened inflation.",
        "Members of the Council also pointed out that given the risk of weaker economic growth in Poland in subsequent quarters the probability of growing demand-driven inflationary pressure was small.",
        "It was also argued that the current situation in the labour market, including an elevated unemployment rate, a decline in employment in the enterprise sector and a fall in the number of job offers, as well as the absence of prospects for a marked improvement in the labour market, would be a factor curbing inflation.",
        "While discussing the current level of NBP interest rates, the Council agreed that the anticipated decline in inflation in the Polish economy, related to slower domestic economic growth in subsequent quarters (as well as to base effects), justified keeping the interest rates unchanged.",
        "Such an assessment was also supported by the November projection of inflation and GDP.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that the impact of the situation in the financial market on the zloty exchange rate remained an upward risk factor for price growth.",
        "While discussing future monetary policy, members of the Council pointed to the persisting considerable uncertainty about economic activity and inflation developments both in the global economy and in Poland.",
        "The majority of Council members upheld their assessment that given the expected macroeconomic scenario which assumed an economic slowdown and a concurrent gradual decline in inflation, the NBP interest rates could stabilize at the current level in subsequent quarters.",
        "It was also argued that a stabilization of monetary policy parameters was conducive to maintaining macroeconomic stability.",
        "At the same time – similarly to the previous meeting – some members of the Council were of the opinion that in subsequent quarters the probability of interest rate increases was higher than that of interest rate cuts.",
        "Those members assessed that while inflation was considerably affected by external factors, should domestic economic activity prove resilient to the slowdown in GDP growth abroad and, hence, should the easing of inflation pressure due to worsened economic conditions turn out smaller than currently expected, an increase of NBP interest rates could be justified.",
        "A few members of the Council pointed out, however, that the NBP’s monetary policy was largely dependent upon the situation in the euro area where a considerable deterioration in the outlook for economic growth made the European Central Bank cut interest rates in November.",
        "In this context, those members claimed that at some point in the future cuts in NBP interest rates could be justified.",
        "At the November meeting, the Council kept the interest rates unchanged at the following levels: reference rate at 4.50%, lombard rate at 6.00%, deposit rate at 3.00%, rediscount rate at 4.75%.",
        "At the meeting, the Monetary Policy Council discussed issues related to the external environment of the Polish economy, including developments in commodity prices and the situation in the financial markets, as well as the outlook for economic growth and inflation in Poland.",
        "While addressing the external developments it was pointed out that although many countries reported a considerable rise in CPI inflation, global economic growth was still accompanied by low core inflation.",
        "It was emphasized that despite the persisting risk of further turmoil in the global economy, the hitherto observed recovery in major developed economies – although not very strong – seems relatively sustainable.",
        "At the same time, in the opinion of some Council members previously formulated concerns about a considerable GDP slowdown in major emerging economies are diminishing.",
        "While analysing the situation in the euro area, some members of the Council indicated that recovery in this economy was rather weak and proceeded amidst persistently high unemployment.",
        "According to those Council members, in the short term, the announced reduction of the fiscal imbalance may be conducive to lowering GDP growth in the euro area countries.",
        "Those Council members emphasized that strong dependence of the Polish economy on the economic developments in Germany might imply that an expected slight deceleration of GDP growth in Germany could be followed by a reduction of GDP growth in Poland.",
        "Other members of the Council argued that the economic developments in Great Britain, where significant fiscal tightening might be observed, confirm the limited scale of negative – in the short term – effects of fiscal consolidation on economic growth.",
        "Moreover, in the opinion of those Council members, favourable economic developments expected in Poland’s major trading partners, including Germany, where GDP is supposed to run above its long-term average, and further economic recovery in the Central and Eastern European countries, will support the growth of Polish exports, and consequently, of GDP.",
        "While discussing the outlook for inflation, attention was paid to the further rise in the prices of energy and agricultural commodities in the global markets.",
        "Members of the Council emphasized that this trend was driven, to a large extent, by long-term factors, i.e.",
        "growing demand, especially from emerging countries amidst limited supply growth over the next few years.",
        "Factors conducive to growing prices of certain commodities include also unfavourable weather conditions in some countries and growing production of biofuels.",
        "At the same time, some Council members argued that expansionary monetary policy of major central banks combined with improved sentiment in financial markets supported intensified speculation in the commodity markets.",
        "Some members of the Council pointed to the attempts undertaken by American supervisory institutions to limit the scale of this activity.",
        "While discussing the issue of appropriate response of the monetary policy to price hikes in the global commodity markets, some members of the Council made reference to the experience of the 1970s oil crises.",
        "They emphasized that countries which at that time decided to conduct a relatively restrictive macroeconomic policy managed to keep inflation at a fairly low level.",
        "In the opinion of those Council members, although commodity shocks are external in nature, they should be taken  Warszawa ul Świętokrzy ska  (22)  51 into consideration when determining domestic monetary policy in order to prevent inflation from remaining at a heightened level.",
        "In this context, those Council members pointed out that currently the increase in global commodity prices translated into a rise in inflation in majority of countries.",
        "Some Council members pointed to the unprecedented scale of fiscal expansion in major developed economies which, amidst a limited possibility of its reduction, would be another factor likely to boost inflation in the external environment of the Polish economy in the longer term.",
        "While addressing the outlook for domestic economic growth, members of the Council pointed out that data on GDP in 2010 Q3, monthly data on economic activity in 2010 Q4 and indicators of economic conditions in January 2011 confirm that economic growth in Poland was continuing at a relatively high level.",
        "It was emphasized that in the subsequent quarters GDP growth might translate into gradual intensification of the domestic inflationary pressure, though GDP growth will probably not exceed its long-term average.",
        "Some members of the Council pointed to a relatively fast growth in private consumption whose further rise might be supported by growing employment.",
        "In the opinion of those Council members, consumption growth might also be supported by fast growth in housing loans to households exceeding disposable income growth considered neutral with respect to the risk of rising inflation.",
        "Those Council members also pointed out that a relatively high and still growing production capacity utilization and very good financial results of companies, especially large ones using capitalintensive technologies, should contribute to a recovery in investment.",
        "Favourable outlook for demand of the private sector, combined with favourable economic developments abroad should – in the opinion of those Council members – support relatively fast GDP growth.",
        "Other members of the Council emphasized that persistently high unemployment, which had been growing in the last months of 2010 and which is likely to limit the growth of individual consumption, constituted an uncertainty factor with respect to the scale of further recovery.",
        "According to those Council members, the absence of a revival in lending to the corporate sector and a possible tightening of banks’ lending policies due to the deterioration of their loan portfolio might be conducive to the reduction of corporate investment, especially of small and medium-sized enterprises.",
        "Moreover, it was pointed out that the risk of a slowdown in domestic economic growth should be reckoned with in the case of strong turmoil connected particularly with the strong fiscal imbalance in certain euro area countries.",
        "Some members of the Council pointed out that the possible crowding out by household lending of other types of bank activity, including the financing of corporate investment, and the relatively weak exchange rate of the zloty, which, among other things, boosts the costs of imports of capital goods, might be conducive to the reduction of the potential output growth of the Polish economy.",
        "Those Council members argued that the reduction of the capital part of the pension system might also have a negative impact on potential output growth.",
        "Other members of the Council assessed that changes in the allocation of contributions to the pension system would not adversely affect either GDP growth or potential output growth.",
        "While addressing inflation it was pointed out that – in line with expectations – CPI inflation in December 2010 had risen to 3.1%, remaining above the NBP’s inflation target of 2.5%.",
        "Some members of the Council emphasized that although the coming months were likely to bring a further rise in CPI inflation due to factors independent of domestic monetary policy such as increases in most VAT rates, inflation might be expected to fall in the second half of 2011.",
        "Other members of the Council pointed out that a rise in inflation in December 2010 was partly connected with a rise in core inflation and that available forecasts suggested that over the horizon of monetary policy’s strongest transmission CPI inflation would remain above the inflation target.",
        "Those Council members emphasized that the rise in global commodity prices was a risk to price stability.",
        "This rise translates into increasing costs of production, which manifests itself in fast PPI growth.",
        "Continued economic recovery in Poland, combined with rising inflation abroad will, in the opinion of those members of the Council, make it easier for enterprises to shift growing costs onto consumers.",
        "Members of the Council agreed that the risk of inflation consolidating at a heightened level was enhanced by a considerable rise of inflation expectations of individuals and enterprises at the end of 2010, accompanied with upward revisions of inflation forecasts by financial sector analysts.",
        "While analyzing the impact of increases in VAT rates on inflation developments, some members of the Council assessed that it would be insignificant and temporary since in the case of certain goods increases in VAT rates would be offset by reduced markups.",
        "Other members of the Council indicated that if, in line with preliminary estimates, the increase in VAT rates had the strongest impact on the costs of road transport, its secondary inflation effect might prove stronger than earlier assessed.",
        "Some members of the Council also argued that a stronger translation of the increase in VAT rates into inflation might also be due to a psychological effect resulting in a rise in inflation expectations.",
        "While discussing the situation in the labour market, some members of the Council pointed to the persistent relatively high unemployment rate and a fall in unit labour costs in 2010 Q3 which limit the rise in wage pressure.",
        "However, other Council members argued that further recovery in the economy would boost wage demands of employees and reduce enterprises' ability to resist to those demands.",
        "The scale of wage demands may be additionally enhanced by persistently heightened inflation.",
        "On the other hand, in addition to increased staff turnover, enterprises' resistance to wage demands may be diminished by very good financial results of companies, especially commodity companies with relatively powerful trade unions.",
        "While discussing the level of interest rates in the Polish economy, members of the Council assessed that the consolidation of the economic recovery abroad and the acceleration of economic growth in Poland, combined with further strong increases in global commodity prices and heightened inflation expectations, increased the risk of inflation running above the NBP's inflation target in the medium term.",
        "In the Council opinion this warranted a tightening of the monetary policy which, considering a certain improvement in the financial markets' sentiment, should take place at the current meeting.",
        "At the same time some members of the Council emphasized that the lower than in the past zloty exchange rate sensitivity to the interest rate differential raises the costs of a possible too late a reaction of the central bank to the inflationary pressure.",
        "The majority of the Council members acknowledged that the raising of interest rates at the January meeting was the beginning of a gradual tightening of the monetary policy, the scale and pace of which would depend on incoming macroeconomic data.",
        "Yet, certain members of the Council assessed that at that moment it was difficult to decide whether a further tightening of the monetary policy would be necessary.",
        "According to those Council members, in its decisions the Council should take into account, among other things, the monetary policy of the European Central Bank which might start increasing interest rates only in the second half of 2011.",
        "A motion to raise the NBP interest rates by 25 basis points was put forward at the meeting.",
        "The Council decided to raise the interest rates to the following levels: the reference rate to 3.75%, the lombard rate to 5.25%, the deposit rate to 2.25% and the rediscount rate to 4.00%.",
        "At the meeting, the Monetary Policy Council discussed the outlook for economic growth and inflation, including the risk of inflation persisting at a heightened level, as well as the pace and possible overall scale of interest rate increases.",
        "While discussing the outlook for domestic economic growth, some members of the Council pointed out that the annual growth rate – after reaching a high level in 2011 Q1 - was likely to decline gradually in the coming quarters, which should reduce the overall scale of interest rate increases necessary to stabilize inflation at the inflation target in the medium term.",
        "It was pointed out that GDP growth would be constrained by – somewhat slower than in the first phase of the recovery – growth in external demand, adverse impact of high inflation on private consumption and corporate investment growth, as well as tightening of domestic fiscal policy.",
        "Some members of the Council pointed at the persisting risk to GDP growth stemming from the developments in the external environment of the Polish economy, including concerns over the sustainability of economic recovery in the major developed economies associated with an elevated level of unemployment and reduction of high fiscal imbalances.",
        "Other members of the Council, however, assessed that Poland's economic growth might be faster than currently forecast.",
        "Good outlook for growth in Polish exports associated with continued rapid growth in exports in Germany and signs of recovery in corporate investment were, in their opinion, indicative of such a possibility.",
        "Those members of the Council pointed out that in view of improving expectations of enterprises about demand and future economic performance, sustained growth in production capacity utilization and good liquidity position, corporate investment could be growing faster than currently anticipated, despite increases in the NBP’s interest rates.",
        "According to these members of the Council, acceleration of investments was likely to be accompanied by continued rapid growth in employment, which would support a rise in private consumption.",
        "Growing prices of commodities and materials, which the enterprises started to quote as the main barrier to their development, was seen by these members as the main threat to investment growth.",
        "At the same time - in their opinion - good liquidity situation of enterprises reduced the risk of potential interest rate increases curbing investment growth.",
        "While discussing the risk of intensifying wage pressure, including second round effects, some members of the Council assessed that this risk was limited at the moment.",
        "They pointed to the continuing moderate wage growth in enterprises, and argued that the risk of second round effects was reduced by increased level of unemployment, freezing of aggregate wages in the public finance sector in 2011 and limited role of trade unions in wage-setting in the Polish economy.",
        "Those members also pointed out that until now there were no signs that the opening of the labor market in Germany and Austria had resulted in a growing scale of migration to these countries.",
        "Other members of the Council emphasized that the continuing rapid growth of employment in enterprises was indicative of the mounting risk of intensifying wage pressure.",
        "They also pointed out that wage demands had soared recently in industries with high trade union density, pointing out that wage growth in enterprises in these industries might put an upward pressure on wages in other enterprises.",
        "Those members of the Council pointed out that the risk of accelerating wage growth was boosted by high inflation expectations of households and  Warszawa ul Świętokrzy ska  (22)  51 businesses.",
        "They also underlined that starting from 2012, wage growth in the economy would be heightened by the minimum wage increase.",
        "While addressing the situation in the credit market, some members of the Council emphasized that lending to households and businesses continued at a relatively low level.",
        "Other members of the Council, however, assessed that a certain upturn in corporate lending could be observed.",
        "In particular, they pointed to some signs of recovery in demand for corporate loans, which was an important factor limiting the growth of bank lending to this sector.",
        "They also paid attention to the announced easing of lending policy for enterprises in 2011 Q2.",
        "While discussing the NBP interest rate policy, members of the Council agreed that the current assessment of the outlook for economic growth and inflation justified the continuation of monetary policy tightening in a previously assumed scale.",
        "The discussion focused on the timing of further tightening of the policy.",
        "According to some members of the Council it was justified to continue with tightening monetary policy by raising interest rates at several month intervals.",
        "They pointed out that the recently released data had not fundamentally changed the assessment of the outlook for economic growth and inflation, and emphasized that most participants in the financial markets expected that the current pace of monetary policy tightening would continue.",
        "In the opinion of some participants of the meeting, factors speaking in favour of such pace of monetary policy tightening included: supply-side character of an inflation increase reflected in core inflation net of food and energy prices running well below the CPI, absence of signs of second-round effects, forecasts pointing to a slowdown in annual economic growth later in 2011 as well as in commodity prices growth in the world markets and the related projected decline in inflation around the inflation target in 2012.",
        "These meeting participants also assessed that the acceleration of interest rate increases might not reduce inflation expectations of households, which are highly adaptive in nature.",
        "Moreover, some members of the Council paid attention to the decision of the Ministry of Finance to exchange some of the European Union funds in the foreign exchange market.",
        "They emphasized that a more comprehensive assessment of the impact of this decision on macroeconomic conditions of monetary policy would be possible in the coming months, which – in their view – spoke in favour of keeping interest rates unchanged at the current meeting.",
        "The majority of the Council members decided that acceleration of interest rate increases would be a more effective way to reduce the risk of persisting heightened inflation than interest rate increases implemented at the current pace.",
        "According to these members of the Council, the rationale behind more rapid interest rate increases was the need of a pre-emptive response to the growing risk of higher costs of enterprises and heightened inflation expectations translating into price and wage increases.",
        "In this context, those members pointed out the data on CPI inflation in March 2011, indicating an acceleration in price growth not only in food and energy but also in most of other categories of consumer goods and services.",
        "Those members also stressed that, considering strong shocks in the agricultural and energy commodity markets, core inflation net of food and energy prices might not correctly reflect permanent changes in inflationary pressures.",
        "Those members also pointed out that the projected decline in inflation around the inflation target at the beginning of 2012 was connected with base effects and assumed that rapid increases in commodity prices in the global markets would slow down.",
        "It was pointed out that this assumption was subject to uncertainty due to persisting political risk in some oil-exporting countries and growing demand for commodities from emerging economies.",
        "Some members of the Council also argued that, in view of the likelihood of inflation and inflation expectations continuing at an elevated level in the coming months, factors speaking in favour of accelerating NBP interest rate hikes included also the risk of real interest rates running at very low levels.",
        "It was also emphasized that acceleration of interest rate increases would reduce the need for any strong interest rate adjustments in the future.",
        "While arguing in favour of accelerating interest rate hikes, some members of the Council justified it through uncertainty about the developments of the zloty exchange rate.",
        "A motion to raise the NBP interest rates by 25 basis points was put forward at the meeting.",
        "The Council decided to increase the interest rates to the following levels: reference rate to 4.25%, lombard rate to 5.75%, deposit rate to 2.75% and rediscount rate to 4.50%.",
        "At its meeting, the Monetary Policy Council addressed the situation in the external environment of the Polish economy and the outlook for domestic economic growth and inflation.",
        "It also discussed future decisions concerning the NBP interest rates.",
        "Members of the Council emphasized the recent considerable deterioration of the situation in the external environment of the Polish economy, including a stronger than expected slowdown in the United States and in the euro area, and weaker GDP growth in emerging economies, notably in China, as well as the mounting turmoil in international financial markets.",
        "It was pointed out that the flagging business sentiment was also, to a considerable extent, the effect of uncertainty about the effectiveness of political measures undertaken to resolve the fiscal crisis in the euro area.",
        "Moreover, the Council emphasised the significant downgrades of global growth forecasts by financial market participants, and the end of the cycle of interest rate increases by central banks in a number of small open developed economies and some developing ones.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members, the risk of a global recession recurring has increased in recent weeks.",
        "However, according to other Council members, the current slowdown in key developed economies does not presage a forthcoming recession; it is rather a reflection of the reduced growth potential of those economies in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.",
        "In this context, these members emphasised particularly the adverse impact of the steep rise in public expenditure following the financial crisis on the private sector's propensity to invest and to consume.",
        "They also pointed to the constrained potential for funding private spending with more debt, since the level of that debt is already high.",
        "It was stressed that although it is difficult to assess the depth of the global economic slowdown, the risk of a sudden collapse in global business activity remains limited.",
        "While discussing the impact of deteriorating external conditions on the prospects for the Polish economy, some Council members underlined the relative resilience of this economy to external shocks.",
        "They assessed that even in the face of slow economic growth in Poland's external environment, domestic GDP growth may remain steady, in particular - in the opinion of some Council members - exports growth may be sustained at a fairly high level.",
        "At the same time, the Council pointed to the risk of Polish exports weakening more markedly, should growth in China decelerate considerably, resulting in smaller exports from Germany to that country.",
        "With regard to the economic situation in Poland it was emphasised that while GDP data indicate sustained relatively robust growth in 2011 Q2, incoming information implies it might lose momentum over the subsequent quarters.",
        "However, some Council members pointed out that the scale of the slowdown may be mitigated by a rise in private investment, which could be stronger than in the July NBP projection.",
        "In support of their position, those members cited higher than anticipated growth in gross fixed capital formation and a marked acceleration in investment outlays by large enterprises in 2011 Q2, as well as very good financial performance of enterprises.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out, however, that the recently observed heightened uncertainty surrounding the outlook for demand may lower enterprises' propensity to invest, as also indicated by survey results.",
        "A year-on-year decline in the estimated costs of new investment started by large  Warszawa ul Świętokrzy ska tele (22)  51 companies in 2011 Q2 was also emphasized as a possible sign of corporate investment weakening in the coming quarters.",
        "With respect to inflationary processes in Poland, it was highlighted that in spite of a fall in recent months, partially due to seasonal factors, CPI and core inflation persist at an elevated level.",
        "Sustained fast growth in producers' prices was also pointed out.",
        "In addition, the Council paid attention to the fact that while inflation expectations of market participants have fallen, households' inflation expectations continue to run relatively high.",
        "It was emphasised, however, that given the adaptive nature of these expectations, they are bound to decrease with a decline in current inflation.",
        "The Council members argued that in light of available forecasts, it was reasonable to expect elevated inflation levels until the end of 2011, with a subsequent return to the NBP inflation target in mid-2012.",
        "It was emphasised that the monetary tightening implemented this year will be conducive to a fall in inflation.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that the return of CPI inflation to the target may be jeopardised by exchange rate developments, particularly amid the turmoil persisting in international financial markets.",
        "It was also noted that in the event of an economic collapse abroad, weak domestic GDP growth would probably coincide with a zloty depreciation, which would hinder the anticipated decline in inflation.",
        "Among the threats to lower inflation, a possible new increase in commodity prices was also pointed out, along with stronger than currently expected rises in fuel, food and administered prices.",
        "As regards the conditions in the credit market, some Council members assessed that lending growth at the current rate does not, as for now, fuel inflationary pressures in the economy.",
        "They pointed, in particular, to a decline in consumer loans and a stabilization of growth in housing loans.",
        "However, other Council members highlighted the relatively high ratio of total consumer loans to GDP in Poland in comparison to other countries, adding that a reduction of this kind of debt would be welcome since it would be conducive to greater macroeconomic stability.",
        "Moreover, they assessed that given robust growth in housing loans and a continuing expansion in lending to corporations, the conditions in the credit market were conducive to higher aggregate demand in the economy.",
        "When discussing the situation in the domestic labour market, the Council underscored weaker employment growth in the enterprise sector in the recent months, following a period of robust expansion, as well as the stabilisation of the unemployment rate at a relatively high level.",
        "Some Council members assessed that given the deteriorating outlook for demand, employment levels in enterprises may be expected to stabilise, or even fall slightly.",
        "It was also pointed out that given the circumstances, the wage pressure will probably remain limited.",
        "With regard to monetary policy pursued amid mounting adverse trends in the external environment of the Polish economy, the Council members emphasised that monetary policy should foster sustained macroeconomic equilibrium.",
        "They pointed out that a monetary policy which takes macroeconomic stability into account will be conducive to maintaining price stability.",
        "While discussing the NBP interest rates, the Council members agreed that these should remain unchanged at the current meeting.",
        "Arguments in support of this stance included the expected decline in inflation in Poland and a weaker outlook for growth in the global economy, and, in consequence, also in Poland.",
        "The Council assessed that recently the balance of risks for inflation has become more balanced, adding that the current evaluation of the inflation and growth outlook for Poland did not imply a need to cut the NBP interest rates.",
        "At the same time, some Council members emphasized that the current level of the NBP interest rates was low against the background of their historical levels and vis-a-vis estimates of Poland’s natural interest rate.",
        "Moreover, it was pointed out that the potential impact of the developments in global financial markets on the zloty exchange rate will constitute an upside risk factor to domestic inflation.",
        "In the opinion of the Council, the significant monetary policy tightening implemented since the beginning of 2011 should facilitate inflation’s return to the target in the medium term.",
        "Given the above, the Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates at the current level.",
        "The Council does not rule out the possibility of further monetary policy adjustment, should the outlook for inflation returning to the target deteriorate.",
        "The Council kept the interest rates unchanged at the following levels: reference rate at 4.5%, lombard rate at 6.00%, deposit rate at 3.00%, rediscount rate at 4.75%.",
        "At the meeting, the Monetary Policy Council analyzed the current and anticipated economic growth and inflation, including the prospects for inflation returning to the target, and discussed future decisions on the NBP interest rates.",
        "While addressing external conditions of economic growth and inflation in Poland, some members of the Council pointed out that although the global economy was recovering, there were signs of a possible weakening of economic conditions abroad in the coming quarters.",
        "In particular, attention was paid to the negative effects of the large fiscal imbalance in some euro area countries, including worsening consumer sentiment in the peripheral countries of the euro area and the risk of increasing financial market turmoil related to the fiscal problems of Greece.",
        "At the same time, some members of the Council pointed to the limited impact of the so-called quantitative easing of monetary policy on economic activity in the United States.",
        "They also emphasized that given the risk of a further weakening of economic conditions in the United States, the Fed might undertake additional measures supporting economic growth in the United States despite rising inflation.",
        "Other members of the Council argued that from the perspective of business conditions in Poland, it was particularly important to take into account the economic situation in Germany, whose prospects remained good, as indicated, among other things, by a favourable structure of GDP growth.",
        "The growing role of domestic demand, including investment and private consumption, in Germany’s economic growth means lower sensitivity of this economy to fluctuations in external demand.",
        "Moreover, some members of the Council emphasized that economic activity in Poland might increase relatively fast even in the case of moderate GDP growth abroad.",
        "While addressing the situation in the commodity markets, it was pointed out that the worsening of investor sentiment due to concerns about economic growth in the United States translated into a halt of commodity price growth in the world markets.",
        "Members of the Council emphasized, however, that considering the prospects for growing demand for commodities amidst limited supply growth, the observed slowdown in price growth might be temporary.",
        "Moreover, some members of the Council indicated that unfavourable agro-meteorological conditions in certain regions key to global food supply (i.e.",
        "protracted drought in China) might contribute to a further rise in the prices of agricultural commodities.",
        "At the same time, members of the Council argued that the anticipated good crop in Russia would limit the growth in food prices.",
        "While discussing the outlook for economic growth in Poland, some members of the Council argued that subsequent quarters might see GDP growth decline as compared to 2011 Q1, which was signalled, among other things, by a halt in the upward trend in industry and construction.",
        "In the opinion of these members of the Council the growth inhibiting factors will include weaker growth of public investment which, most likely, will not be accompanied by a proportionally strong acceleration in corporate investment growth, and a slowdown in private consumption growth.",
        "In their opinion, the slowdown in private consumption growth will be connected with a weak – amidst heightened inflation - growth of real disposable income.",
        "Those members also pointed out that the acceleration in annual retail sales growth in April was largely due to a statistical base effect.",
        "Other members of the Council assessed, however, that economic growth might continue at a relatively high level due to a favourable outlook for growth of both external and domestic demand.",
        "In the opinion of those members of the Council, export growth was supported by good conditions in the German economy, investment growth was supported by good financial results of enterprises and growing productive capacity utilization, and the rise in consumption was driven by increasing employment which might continue as a result of growing investment.",
        "While referring to the factors that may weaken consumption growth, those members pointed out that maintaining private consumption growth in 2011 Q1 at a level close to that recorded in 2010 Q4 – despite the already heightened inflation at that time, a simultaneous decline in consumer loans and the bringing forward of purchases to the end of 2010 due to changes in VAT rates scheduled to take effect in 2011 – might attest to the fact that the impact of these factors was limited, and improvement in the labour market was crucial for consumption prospects.",
        "While addressing the impact of growing economic activity on inflation, members of the Council were of the opinion that the implemented fiscal tightening combined with the more restrictive monetary policy would limit the risk of too rapid growth of aggregate demand and of intensifying inflationary pressure.",
        "Furthermore, the rebound in corporate investment should boost potential output growth, which is a factor supporting the return of inflation to the target in the medium term.",
        "At the same time, some members of the Council emphasized that, in their view, the potential growth rate was now lower than before the financial crisis, which should be taken into consideration in the analysis of the output gap and inflationary pressure.",
        "Other members of the Council assessed that the impact of the global financial crisis on potential output growth in Poland was not significant.",
        "While assessing wage growth developments, it was emphasized that the acceleration in wage growth in the enterprise sector in April could largely have resulted from the postponement of the payment of bonuses and awards in the mining and energy sectors, and therefore it was difficult to assess the sustainability of this phenomenon.",
        "At the same time, some members of the Council pointed out that factors such as rising current inflation, elevated inflation expectations, weaker than in previous years growth in the number of the economically active, good financial condition of enterprises, particularly in industries with a strong presence of labour unions where wage demands intensified in the recent period, as well as an increase in the minimum wage, could put an upward pressure on wages.",
        "Those members also stressed that although growth in unit labour costs in the economy declined in 2011 Q1, the service sector – constituting the largest share of value added in the economy – saw labour productivity growth significantly below wage growth.",
        "They also pointed to lags between wage bargaining and real wage growth.",
        "Other members of the Council argued, however, that the still high unemployment rate reduced the risk of a mounting wage pressure.",
        "This risk, according to members of the Council, is also limited by the already implemented substantial tightening of the monetary policy of the NBP.",
        "While analyzing the developments in lending to the corporate sector, some members of the Council pointed out that the already observed monetary policy tightening did not hamper growth in loans to businesses, although it translated into rising credit costs, which might be indicative of a favorable outlook for lending to this sector.",
        "Other members of the Council assessed that rising credit costs could have a dampening effect on growth in corporate lending.",
        "While addressing the outlook for inflation it was pointed out that the acceleration in price growth was observed in most categories of goods and services, and hence affected core inflation.",
        "It was also emphasized that an important change as compared to previous years was the fading of the antiinflationary effect of falling prices of goods imported from countries with low production costs.",
        "Some members of the Council assessed, at the same time, that the downward trend in prices of these goods coming to a halt might be a lasting phenomenon, resulting from changes in the labour markets of the largest emerging economies.",
        "It was also stressed that the rapid growth in prices was accompanied by heightened inflation expectations.",
        "While assessing the prospects for inflation returning to the target, some members of the Council pointed out that by the end of 2011 inflation was likely to remain above the upper limit for deviations from the inflation target, as suggested by the short-term forecasts prepared at the NBP.",
        "It was argued, at the same time, that in line with these forecasts, inflation was soon to start declining gradually and to come close to the inflation target of 2.5% in 2012.",
        "While discussing the NBP interest rates, the majority of Council members agreed that a fast growth in prices in most groups of goods and services and a high level of inflation expectations combined with the risk of rising wage demands justified raising the NBP interest rates further at the current meeting.",
        "In their opinion, the low level of the real interest rate was another factor speaking in favour of an interest rate increase.",
        "Some members of the Council assessed, however, that it was not necessary to increase the NBP interest rates at the current meeting, particularly in view of the expectations of ECB interest rates being kept unchanged in June 2011 as well as considering the external nature of the shocks driving up current inflation in Poland.",
        "At the same time, the majority of Council members indicated that the substantial tightening of monetary policy implemented since the beginning of 2011 should enable inflation to return to the target in the medium term, and further tightening of monetary policy would be justified should the prospects of inflation returning to the target deteriorate.",
        "An assessment of these prospects will be possible after data released in subsequent months have been analysed.",
        "Some members of the Council assessed that in subsequent months further tightening of monetary policy was more likely than monetary policy easing.",
        "Yet, other members of the Council argued that from the perspective of stabilizing inflation at the target, the current level of the NBP interest rates might be appropriate in the longer term.",
        "The issue of the POLONIA rate running below the NBP reference rate was also addressed at the meeting.",
        "In the opinion of some members of the Council, it would be justified to symmetrically narrow the corridor between the NBP deposit rate and the NBP lombard rate which would lead to a lowering of the deviation of the POLONIA rate from the NBP reference rate.",
        "A motion to raise the NBP interest rates by 25 basis points was put forward at the meeting.",
        "The Council decided to increase the interest rates to the following levels: reference rate to 4.50%, lombard rate to 6.00%, deposit rate to 3.00% and rediscount rate to 4.75%.",
        "At the meeting a motion to symmetrically narrow the corridor between the NBP deposit rate and the NBP lombard rate by a total of 50 basis points was put forward.",
        "The motion did not pass.",
        "At the meeting, the Monetary Policy Council discussed the outlook for growth and inflation in Poland, the situation in the domestic labour market and in the external environment of the Polish economy.",
        "With regard to the developments in Poland’s real economy, it was pointed out that GDP growth was likely to remain close to the previous year’s level.",
        "Some Council Members drew attention to the fact that there were still no signs of a visible recovery in corporate investment.",
        "They emphasised that at the current rate of economic growth there was a limited risk of deep macroeconomic imbalances building up.",
        "At the same time, those Council members pointed out that recent data increased the uncertainty about the short-term outlook for output growth.",
        "In particular, a further rise in (seasonally adjusted) unemployment rate was mentioned, along with a relatively slow growth of construction and assembly, a slowdown in retail sales growth in January 2011, a deterioration in some economic climate indicators and a markedly slower expansion in lending than in the corresponding periods of previous years.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that much of the December 2010 and January 2011 data could have been influenced, to a significant degree, by one-off factors (economic and statistical), which made their assessment more difficult.",
        "In this context, some Council members assessed that slow growth in construction and assembly was primarily due to unfavourable weather conditions and thus did not constitute a negative signal for recovery in corporate investment.",
        "Equally, in the opinion of these Council members, the weaker retail sales growth did not reflect a strong decrease in individual consumption, as it resulted mainly from the slump in car sales, affected largely by the abolition, as of 2011, of VAT rebates for cars with goods vehicle approval certificates.",
        "At the same time, they pointed out that while advance purchases of cars in 2010 increased the growth of domestic demand they simultaneously deepened the negative contribution of net exports to GDP.",
        "With regard to GDP growth in 2012 and 2013, it was pointed out that the March NBP projection expected it to slow down, and individual consumption and gross fixed capital formation growth were weaker than in the previous projection.",
        "It was emphasised that the slower rise in investment resulted from the envisaged postponement of the absorption of some EU funds from 2012 till subsequent years as well as the adverse impact of commodity price rises on enterprises’ investment activity.",
        "However, some members drew the Council’s attention to the significant uncertainty regarding the developments of investment projects co-financed from EU funds.",
        "In addition, some members were of the opinion that the developments in the labour market would act against a deceleration in individual consumption.",
        "In those members’ opinion, investment might also rise faster than in the projection.",
        "Factors pointing to such a scenario include the rising production capacity utilisation and enterprises’ good financial results, enabling them to self-finance investment projects as well as facilitating access to external financing.",
        "While discussing inflationary pressures in the economy, it was emphasised that the pronounced rise in CPI was driven mainly by the rise in agricultural and energy commodity prices in the world markets, increases in VAT rates and administered prices, i.e.",
        "primarily factors unrelated to domestic  Warszawa ul Świętokrzy ska  (22)  51 monetary policy.",
        "It was pointed out that the increase in headline inflation feeds into higher inflation expectations of households and enterprises as well as expectations implied by yields on long-term Treasury securities.",
        "At the same time, it was indicated that while the available forecasts point to a possible further rise in inflation in the coming months, the impact of the factors contributing to its elevated level will dissipate in the second half of 2011 and – according to some Council members – inflation will subside.",
        "Notwithstanding that, it was pointed out that over almost the whole horizon of the March projection – assuming no change in the NBP policy rates – inflation remains above the inflation target.",
        "According to the assessment of some Council members the risk of inflation running above the central path of the March projection was higher than the risk that it would be running below this path.",
        "While addressing wage pressures in the economy, some Council members stressed the fact that the current situation in the labour market did not indicate that these pressures should escalate.",
        "They pointed out that the marked acceleration in wage growth in Q4 2010 was probably temporary, as it had been driven by a sharp rise in government sector wages preceding a wage freeze in 2011.",
        "Those Council members stated that wage growth in enterprises remained moderate, especially against the background of labour productivity growth, and was consistent with inflation stabilising at the inflation target.",
        "However, other Council members pointed to the fact that the acceleration in wage growth at the turn of 2010 and 2011 was indicative of uncertainty as to whether that growth would continue to be moderate and thus might signal the risk of mounting wage pressures within the monetary policy transmission horizon.",
        "Those members also expected a gradual deterioration in the relationship between wage and labour productivity growth, stronger than the one signalled by the March projection of inflation and GDP.",
        "Amongst the factors pointing to a limited risk of intensifying wage pressure – including a limited risk of elevated inflation and inflation expectations feeding into wage growth – some Council members listed the rising unemployment rate and the fall in the number of jobs offered, resulting in a significant decrease in the labour market tensions index.",
        "Those members highlighted the fact that the weaker labour demand, while resulting mainly from the reduction in the number of subsidised jobs, should mitigate wage growth demands.",
        "However, other Council members assessed that while subsidised jobs had fallen, surveys suggest rising reservation wage.",
        "This reduces the likelihood that rising unemployment will significantly weaken wage pressures.",
        "These Council members also pointed to the March projection, according to which unemployment rate will gradually decrease and in the second half of 2011 will go below the steadily rising NAWRU unemployment rate.",
        "In the opinion of these Council members, good financial results of enterprises were another factor conducive to a possible fast build-up of wage pressures.",
        "While discussing the developments in the external environment of the Polish economy, the Council pointed to the continued moderate GDP growth in major advanced economies and the accompanying rise in headline inflation, driven by rising global commodity prices.",
        "Some Council members pointed out that major central banks kept interest rates low, despite some signals pointing to the possibility that some of them will tighten monetary policy.",
        "Those members added that the quickly rising government debt in the advanced economies remains an important uncertainty factor for economic growth, including the situation in the global financial markets.",
        "At the same time, continued good business climate in Germany was emphasised, along with the strong synchronisation of business cycles in Germany and Poland.",
        "Some Council members were of the opinion that the tightening of monetary policy in China may adversely affect the outlook for German, and consequently also Polish exports.",
        "According to those members, other factors with a potentially weakening effect on Polish exports include the fiscal consolidation in the EU countries and a possible tightening of monetary policy in some of these economies.",
        "While discussing the rapid growth of commodity prices, some Council members expressed the opinion that the current commodity shocks were temporary supply shocks.",
        "However, it was pointed out that the ample liquidity in the financial markets, coupled with low short-term elasticity of commodity supply may result in a stronger than expected rise in these prices.",
        "Furthermore, other Council members expressed the view that a sharp rise in demand for commodities on the part of emerging economies may also have been conducive to commodity price increases and therefore these increases may be more lasting.",
        "Those Council members believed that rising commodity prices may also reflect mounting inflation concerns amongst the financial markets participants.",
        "It was simultaneously pointed out that the elevated commodity prices could act towards a weakening of global economic activity.",
        "While analysing developments in loan aggregates, some Council members highlighted the continuing fall in consumer loans, along with a deceleration in the expansion of housing loans at the beginning of 2011.",
        "At the same time other Council members stated that growth of housing loans remained strong compared to the growth in disposable income achievable in the low inflation environment.",
        "Some Council members expressed the view that the sluggish expansion in corporate loans might have a curbing effect on investment growth.",
        "They also pointed out that a rise in the number of entities without creditworthiness in Q4 2010 did not bode well for a possible recovery in lending.",
        "However, other Council members pointed out that the rise in the number of entities without creditworthiness was accompanied by a drop in the share of liabilities of these entities in the total liabilities to the banking sector.",
        "With regard to public sector demand, some Council members assessed that a significant fiscal tightening was unlikely in the years 2011-2012 given the date of the parliamentary election.",
        "Other Council members, however, argued that the need to comply with the requirements relating to the public finance sector deficit resulting from the Excessive Deficit Procedure will translate into a more pronounced fiscal tightening in 2012.",
        "In this context, the European Commission decision was invoked, concerning the maintenance of the current approach to accounting for the costs of pension reform in the calculation of the deficit and debt of the sector.",
        "Simultaneously, these Council members held the view that a fiscal policy tightening would not curb the build-up of demand pressures in the economy.",
        "It was pointed out that a more comprehensive evaluation of the outlook for public finance sector demand would be possible only after the government had presented measures to limit the sector’s deficit in its Convergence Programme update.",
        "While discussing the level of NBP interest rates it was emphasised that their increase in January 2011 initiated the process of a gradual tightening of monetary policy, the scale and pace of which would depend on the incoming data on macroeconomic developments.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members, a further interest rate increase at the current meeting was justified, considering the sustained risk that wage and inflation pressure would intensify in the medium term.",
        "Such a decision would also limit the risk that the elevated inflation expectations persist.",
        "These Council members argued that prompt interest rate increases would reduce the overall scale of increases necessary to stabilise inflation at the inflation target in the medium term.",
        "In these members’ opinion, the reduced sensitivity of the zloty exchange rate to the interest rate differential was another argument in favour of prompt interest rate increases.",
        "The majority of Council members represented the view that recent data increased the uncertainty regarding economic growth, including a recovery in investment and sustainability of the acceleration in consumption and thereby substantiated the decision not to change interest rates at the current meeting.",
        "Further arguments in favour of this decision included the persistently high unemployment rate and modest wage pressures in the enterprise sector, both reducing the risk that heightened inflation, which up to now has resulted from factors beyond the direct influence of monetary policy, should persist.",
        "Furthermore, in the opinion of some Council members, NBP decisions on interest rates should take into account the monetary policy pursued by major central banks, in particular the European Central Bank.",
        "A motion to raise the NBP interest rates by 25 basis points was put forward at the meeting.",
        "The motion did not pass.",
        "The Council kept the interest rates unchanged: reference rate at 3.75%, the lombard rate at 5.25%, the deposit rate at 2.25%, the rediscount rate at 4.00.%",
        "At the meeting, the Monetary Policy Council analysed the situation in the external environment of the Polish economy, the outlook for economic growth and inflation in Poland, including the prospects for inflation returning to the target, and discussed the current and future decisions on the NBP interest rates.",
        "While addressing the external conditions of economic growth and inflation in Poland, the Council pointed to heightened uncertainty surrounding the outlook for the global economy, including the recent signs of a weakening economic growth in the United States and the prolonged public finance crisis in some euro area countries.",
        "In particular, attention was paid to mounting concerns about the stability of the economic situation in Greece and the related rise in risk aversion in the international financial markets.",
        "It was emphasized that the debt crisis might – by increasing uncertainty in the euro area – lead to a decline in economic growth in this region, which would translate into slower GDP growth in Poland.",
        "However, some members of the Council argued that activity growth in Poland might be relatively fast even in the case of a moderate GDP growth abroad.",
        "In turn, other Council members were of the opinion that increased risk aversion in the international financial markets related to the fiscal problems of Greece was more likely to affect Polish economy through a depreciation in the zloty exchange rate, which would support a heightened inflation in the country.",
        "While discussing the economic growth in Poland in the coming quarters, it was emphasized that GDP growth would most probably weaken gradually, which was also in line with the NBP’s July projection.",
        "In this context, a slight weakening of the upward trend in industrial output in the past few months and a decline in the PMI anticipating a slowdown in the manufacturing sector in 2011 Q3 were pointed to.",
        "The expected decline in GDP growth would be – in the opinion of members of the Council – partly connected with fiscal tightening.",
        "Some members of the Council emphasized that a rise in current inflation, through its curbing effect on the growth of households’ real disposable income, might also lead to a slowdown in economic growth.",
        "Other members of the Council, however, pointed to a drop in households’ deposits last month, which might be indicative of a lower propensity to save.",
        "At the same time, it was indicated that it was difficult to assess, on the basis of one month’s data, whether this situation would be a lasting phenomenon.",
        "Moreover, it was pointed out that interest rate increases implemented earlier this year might also act towards slower economic growth, albeit with a lag.",
        "Some members of the Council remarked, in turn, that interest rate increases had not so far hindered the growth in corporate loans and a rapid increase in housing loans.",
        "While addressing the outlook for maintaining the current rate of GDP growth in Poland in subsequent years, members of the Council emphasized the related high uncertainty, mainly with respect to investment.",
        "More specifically, it was unclear, in their opinion, to what extent the decline in public investment might be offset by rising corporate investment.",
        "Some members of the Council pointed out that the expected decline in public investment would reduce the crowding out effect on private investment by mitigating the upward pressure on cost of materials and construction works.",
        "It was also added that the rise in corporate investment would be fuelled by a relatively high capacity 0 0-919 Warszawa u l Ś wi ę to krzys ka 1 1 /2 1 tel (22 ) 653 2 8 88  (22) 653 1 3 28 utilization at present.",
        "At the same time, other members of the Council indicated that reduced public investment, resulting in lower demand growth in the economy, might stem private investment.",
        "While addressing the developments in demand in subsequent years, it was pointed out that the heightened current inflation would boost public expenditure in 2012 as a consequence of indexation of old-age and disability pensions and social benefits.",
        "While discussing inflation, it was indicated that price growth in Poland was largely affected by external factors.",
        "In this context, some members of the Council pointed to a high risk of external factors continuing to push up inflation in Poland.",
        "Some members of the Council emphasized that the recently observed halting in commodity price growth in the global markets might be temporary, considering the prospects of persistently high global demand for commodities amidst limited possibilities of increasing their supply and a considerable liquidity surplus in the financial markets.",
        "In their opinion, commodity prices might, in the longer run, continue on an upward trend.",
        "Some members of the Council pointed to the possibility of other countries, including in particular the United States, further easing their monetary and fiscal policy with a view to stimulate economic growth, despite rising inflation.",
        "Among other potential external sources of inflation, the announced tax reduction in Germany was mentioned, which would boost demand pressure in this economy, and persistently high inflation in China.",
        "While addressing current inflation in Poland, in particular the fact that it is presently running above the target, some members of the Council were of the opinion that this was due not only to the external supply shocks but also to the heightened domestic inflationary pressure.",
        "This followed, in their opinion, from the fact that both the level and the rate of growth of inflation in Poland exceeded those observed in many other countries which had also experienced external supply shocks.",
        "While discussing the outlook for inflation in Poland in 2011, it was emphasized that although May 2011 saw a marked rise in CPI inflation (partly as a result of a change in GUS quotation of seasonal goods prices), and inflation expectations of individuals remained at a heightened level, the available forecasts suggested that the coming months should see a gradual fall in inflation.",
        "Yet, some members of the Council pointed out that, notwithstanding the above, inflation would remain – according to the same forecasts – significantly above the target.",
        "It was emphasized that due to lags in the monetary policy transmission mechanism, the mediumterm outlook for inflation was of key importance.",
        "It was pointed out that, in line with the July projection based on the NECMOD model, the years 2012-2013 would see inflation lowering close to the target.",
        "This would be driven by a weaker GDP growth, a slow-down in the growth of global commodity prices and the statistical base effect.",
        "At the same time, some members of the Council indicated the risk of persistence of external sources of inflation and the possibility of a faster GDP growth in Poland than suggested by the projection, which would translate into higher price growth.",
        "Some members of the Council emphasized that the persistence of a relatively high core inflation within the projection horizon constituted a risk to CPI inflation subsiding close to the target.",
        "According to those members of the Council, a strong deceleration in the growth of food and energy prices expected within the projection horizon is very unlikely.",
        "While discussing the NBP interest rates, the majority of Council members agreed that the interest rates should be kept unchanged at the current meeting.",
        "Some members of the Council assessed that the NBP interest rate increases implemented since the beginning of 2011 should enable inflation to return to the target in the medium term as indicated by the July projection of inflation and GDP.",
        "It was emphasized that all the available inflation forecasts anticipate its decline within one year.",
        "At the same time, the majority of Council members did not rule out the possibility of further interest rate increases in the future, should the prospects of inflation returning to the target deteriorate, and the risk of the so-called second round effects rise.",
        "Some members of the Council indicated, however, that the May 2011 inflation, significantly exceeding expectations, and the fact that it is anticipated to decline only slightly by the end of 2011, coupled with the deepening of the negative real interest rate in Poland amidst a relatively fast economic growth, justified increasing the NBP interest rates at the current meeting.",
        "A motion to raise the NBP interest rates by 25 basis points was put forward at the meeting.",
        "The Council kept the interest rates unchanged: reference rate at 4.50%, lombard rate at 6.00%, deposit rate at 3.00% and rediscount rate at 4.75%."

        "At the same time, the Council members emphasized that economic conditions in emerging market economies were deteriorating.",
        "It was highlighted that GDP growth in China continued to slow down and underlined that it could decelerate further due to significant imbalances in China and limited scope to stimulate this economy.",
        "The Council members also pointed out that Brazil, Russia and Ukraine remained in a deep recession.",
        "Some Council members emphasised that deteriorating economic conditions in emerging market economies had already led to a decline in export growth of Germany, Poland's main trading partner, which could in turn result in weaker growth of Polish exports.",
        "It was underlined that deteriorating economic conditions in emerging market economies could result in lower growth in other economies.",
        "In consequence, risk aversion in international financial markets has risen and global financial asset prices have fallen markedly.",
        "In this context, it was highlighted that many emerging market currencies, including the zloty, had also depreciated.",
        "The Council members also noted that prices for crude oil and other commodities were still very low.",
        "It was assessed that low commodity prices were conducive to slower price growth worldwide.",
        "Certain Council members underlined that in some countries lower commodity prices were translating into larger purchasing power of households and higher consumer spending.",
        "At the same time, some Council members indicated that in commodity exporters, the fall in commodity prices resulted in decelerating economic growth, in some cases even in a recession.",
        "These Council members stressed that declining mining investment expenditures were one of the main reasons behind the economic slowdown in the United States in the second half of 2015.",
        "Some Council members pointed to a recent rise in uncertainty regarding the world economic outlook, including not only the emerging market economies, but also the United States.",
        "Therefore, the Federal Reserve indicated that interest rates in the US might be raised at a slower pace than previously expected.",
        "The ECB, in turn, pointed to a likely increase in monetary expansion in the coming months, as the inflation forecasts for the euro area had been revised downwards due to falling commodity prices.",
        "Some Council members judged that the more expansionary monetary policy outlook in the core economies might have contained the fall in Polish financial asset prices and the depreciation of the zloty.",
        "While analysing the economic conditions in Poland, attention was drawn to preliminary estimate of national accounts for 2015 that pointed to an acceleration in GDP growth in 2015 Q4.",
        "It was underlined that domestic demand remained the main driver of economic growth.",
        "It was highlighted that investment and consumption growth had probably accelerated slightly in 2015 Q4 on the back of improving labour market conditions, envisaged by a further fall in unemployment rate, continued high employment and stable wage growth.",
        "The rise in demand is also supported by positive consumer sentiment, good financial standing of enterprises and their high capacity utilization.",
        "However, certain Council members noted that sentiment in industry had deteriorated somewhat of late, but stressed that it was not reflected in broader data on economic activity.",
        "Some Council members indicated that despite deteriorating conditions in the emerging market economies, Polish exports continued to grow and external trade balance remained positive.",
        "Discussing the economic growth outlook, the majority of the Council members judged that it would most likely remain stable in the coming quarters.",
        "They highlighted that consumer demand growth in the near future could be supported by a likely further improvement in labour market conditions, the recent renewed fall in fuel prices and a rise in disposable income of some households resulting from family benefits (Family 500+ government programme, which is to be launched in the coming months).",
        "Moreover, certain Council members argued that the recent depreciation of the zloty could improve price competitiveness of Polish exports, leading to higher GDP growth.",
        "Some Council members also pointed to high capacity utilisation in the economy, which should support replacement investments of enterprises, particularly given ongoing high industrial production growth.",
        "Corporate investment growth will also be supported by good financial standing of enterprises.",
        "However, as highlighted by some Council members, the fall in commodity prices has an adverse effect on the profitability of the Polish energy industry.",
        "Certain Council members expressed concerns that rising risk in the environment of the Polish economy might prove a drag for economic growth in the coming quarters.",
        "During a discussion on inflation developments in Poland, it was stressed that price growth remained negative.",
        "It was highlighted that price growth most likely would stay below zero for longer than previously expected.",
        "The main reasons for that are the fall in crude oil prices in the recent months and a reduction in energy tariffs on sale and distribution of gas and electricity for households effective from the beginning of 2016.",
        "It was underlined that price growth was also contained by the lack of inflation pressure resulting from a negative output gap as well as no wage pressure despite improving labour market conditions.",
        "Moreover, certain Council members were of the opinion that a Russian embargo on Polish food exports was also contributing to lower food prices in the domestic market.",
        "Council members assessed that stable economic growth should support a gradual rise in core inflation, thus contributing to higher CPI growth.",
        "At the same time, some Council members pointed to upside risks to price growth in the coming months.",
        "Some of them pointed to a rise in probability that the output gap might close earlier than previously expected given a likely acceleration in consumption growth.",
        "In consequence, there is a risk that demand pressure might occur.",
        "These Council members also pointed to the risk that a positive output gap (which is a difference between the observed GDP and its estimate assuming no inflation pressure in the economy) and a further improvement in labour market conditions could result in an acceleration of growth in unit labour costs.",
        "Other Council members argued that following the introduction of family benefits, wage pressure could grow, since – given the improving labour market conditions and the persistent mismatches in this market – the bargaining position of lower-paid employees would increase.",
        "Certain Council members underlined that the recent depreciation of the zloty should contribute to higher import prices, which could translate into higher consumer price growth.",
        "Referring to the interest rates, the Council decided that they should remain unchanged at the current meeting.",
        "The Council members indicated that lower than previously expected price growth in the coming months would be driven mainly by factors beyond the influence of domestic monetary policy.",
        "However, in the medium term, CPI growth would be supported by steady increase in domestic economic activity.",
        "The Council members confirmed their assessment that – given the available data and forecasts – the current level of interest rates helped to keep the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and to maintain macroeconomic stability.",
        "The majority of the Council members stressed that continued uncertainty regarding the external and domestic determinants of monetary policy was another argument in favour of stabilization of interest rates at the current meeting.",
        "The Council members expressed an opinion that in these conditions, decisions on the interest rates should take into account their potential impact on the financial markets.",
        "Moreover, some Council members assessed that when deciding about the level of the interest rates, they should factor in their impact on the financial sector stability.",
        "At the same time, in the opinion of certain Council members, there might be a room for further monetary policy easing after risk aversion in the international financial markets abates.",
        "In turn, certain Council members judged that in the coming months it might be justified to consider beginning of interest rate increases, since, in their view, inflation pressure could appear due to favourable labour market conditions and the risk of a significant acceleration in consumer demand growth.",
        "The Council members also underlined that a more comprehensive assessment of the outlook for price developments and economic growth in the coming quarters would be possible after the Council gets acquainted with the March projection of inflation and GDP.",
        "Certain Council members indicated that the assessment of the impact of changes in fiscal policy on demand and prices in the economy should also be an important factor affecting monetary policy decisions.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 1.50%, the lombard rate at 2.50%, the deposit rate at 0.50%, the rediscount rate at 1.75%.",
        "During the discussion on developments in the euro area, it was emphasised that national accounts data had confirmed stable GDP growth in this economy.",
        "Certain Council members noted that investment expenditures in the euro area were lower than before the global financial crisis.",
        "It was indicated that according to available forecasts, economic growth in the euro area might ease in the following quarters, albeit only slightly.",
        "It was highlighted that European industrial and export sectors had recently shown some signs of recovery.",
        "In particular, sentiment in European industrial sector is the highest in several years due to i.a.",
        "a significant increase in export orders.",
        "It was argued that this could support growth in Polish industrial output, most notably export manufacturing.",
        "It was assessed that improving conditions in European industrial sector might be related to stabilising growth in the euro area’s external environment.",
        "In this context, it was pointed out that in the United States GDP growth had accelerated, while in China economic conditions had stabilised.",
        "It was noted that the available forecasts for the US economy were indicating that in 2017 GDP growth might be higher than in 2016, fuelled by stable consumption growth and recovery in investment activity.",
        "Against this background, some Council members pointed to uncertainty around the US economic outlook resulting from likely shifts in economic policy after the recent elections.",
        "However, their extent and spillovers were judged as vague at the time of the meeting.",
        "It was stressed that in China GDP growth – in spite of stabilisation in previous quarters – was still the lowest since the global financial crisis.",
        "Some Council members pointed to weaker lending and infrastructure investment growth in China in 2016 Q3, which might indicate subsiding fiscal and monetary stimulus in this country.",
        "In addition, certain Council members emphasised that in some emerging market economies GDP growth might decelerate again on the back of a recent decline in global oil prices.",
        "While discussing price developments abroad, it was highlighted that price growth in the external environment of the Polish economy was still very low, but it had picked up of late.",
        "It was assessed that the rise in the annual price growth rates resulted mainly from higher crude oil prices compared to a year before, which were gradually feeding through to the energy price growth rates.",
        "It was noted that oil price futures were indicating a rise of its prices in the following quarters, albeit – as certain Council members assessed – most probably to a limited extent, given lower costs of shale extraction in the United States and a likely increase in oil exports by some other producers.",
        "The outlook for oil prices was, however, judged as highly uncertain, particularly if the pre-agreement on oil production cuts had not become effective at the forthcoming summit of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).",
        "Referring to monetary policy abroad, it was noted that the European Central Bank had kept interest rates at close to zero, including the deposit rate below zero, and had continued financial asset purchases.",
        "It was observed that the ECB had not confirmed its intention to scale down the asset purchases in the coming months.",
        "It was further underlined that the Federal Reserve – after a rise in December 2015 – had kept the interest rates unchanged, pointing to their probable increase in the future.",
        "It was judged that – given the results of the US election – the uncertainty about the timing of the following increase in the fed funds rate had risen.",
        "Moreover, it was observed that the US election results could raise volatility in the international financial markets.",
        "While discussing the developments in Poland’s real economy, the Council members assessed that stable economic growth continued in Poland, even though data on production and retail sales in 2016 Q3 pointed to weaker GDP growth.",
        "Attention was also drawn to a deterioration in manufacturing confidence in October.",
        "A further fall in construction output was also observed.",
        "It was attributed to a decline in investment, related to a temporarily lower absorption of EU funds stemming from the completion of the previous financial framework.",
        "Some Council members judged that lower investment activity, especially of small and medium enterprises, could have been determined by the uncertainty about the regulatory environment of business.",
        "Alongside that, some Council members pointed to ongoing recovery in the housing market, which was supportive of residential investment growth.",
        "At the same time, it was stressed that the main driver of economic growth was still rising consumer demand, supported by the gradual improvement in the labour market, favourable household sentiment and the child benefit payments under the \"Family 500 plus\" programme.",
        "When discussing the economic outlook for Poland, the Council members underlined that according to the November projection, economic growth in 2016 Q4 might remain soft, and then pick up in the following quarters.",
        "The Council members emphasised that consumption would remain the major source of economic growth in the quarters to come.",
        "It was noted that under the projection, consumer expenditure would rise at a faster pace in 2017.",
        "Higher GDP growth in 2017 would also be supported by the expected increase in investment related to greater EU funds absorption, as indicated by a rise in the number of new financial framework contracts.",
        "Certain Council members noted, however, that some local governments might face constraints in co-financing investment projects.",
        "In the opinion of certain Council members, in the following quarters corporate investment should be reinforced by decreasing uncertainty about the regulatory environment of business, amid the good financial standing of firms and their high capacity utilisation.",
        "While analysing price developments in Poland, it was emphasised that the annual consumer price growth rate was still negative, yet deflation was subsiding.",
        "It was noted that in October the annual consumer price growth rate had been only slightly below zero.",
        "It was emphasised that the reversal of deflationary trends was also evidenced in positive annual producer price growth rate for the first time in four years.",
        "It was assessed that the increase in price growth resulted mainly from the dissipating effects of the earlier drop in global commodity prices.",
        "The other factor of higher price growth cited during the meeting was faster increase in wages compared to the previous quarters.",
        "At the same time, it was stressed that price growth was still contained by low inflation abroad and negative output gap in Poland.",
        "Against this background, it was reminded that most core inflation measures were still negative.",
        "Referring to the outlook for price developments, the Council members observed that according to the November projection, price growth would be rising steadily to turn positive in the following quarters.",
        "The projection also indicates that in the coming years inflation will be close to the lower bound for deviations from the NBP inflation target.",
        "Besides waned effects of the earlier fall in commodity prices, price growth in 2017 will be fuelled by the acceleration in GDP growth envisaged in the projection.",
        "However, certain Council members were of the opinion that price growth rate in 2017 could be somewhat lower than anticipated by the projection.",
        "According to these Council members, weaker than projected price growth might result from likely decline in global commodity prices and slower than forecasted investment growth in Poland.",
        "While discussing the level of the NBP interest rates, the Council judged that they should remain unchanged.",
        "The Council members confirmed their assessment that the stabilisation of interest rates helped to keep the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintain macroeconomic stability.",
        "The majority of Council members assessed that an argument for keeping the interest rates unchanged was in particular the gradual increase in price growth, which – in line with the November projection – should approach the lower bound for deviations from the NBP target in the coming years.",
        "According to certain Council members, the present level of the NBP interest rates may also be conducive to a rise in the household savings rate.",
        "In the opinion of the Council, an additional argument for the NBP interest rate stabilisation was uncertainty regarding domestic and external conditions for monetary policy.",
        "The Council members emphasised that in light of information available at the time of the meeting, stabilisation of the NBP interest rates in the following quarters was the most likely scenario.",
        "Certain Council members judged that in an event of prolonged economic slowdown and rising risk of inflation remaining below the target for an extended period of time, it would be justified to consider a decrease in the NBP interest rates.",
        "However, the majority of the Council members stressed that the Council's decisions should also take into account the impact of the level of the interest rates on the stability of the domestic financial sector.",
        "In turn, certain Council members assessed that given the character of the factors curbing economic activity growth, the impact of a potential reduction in the NBP interest rates on the domestic economic conditions would be limited.",
        "At the same time, some Council members pointed out that should inflationary pressure appear, creating a risk of exceeding the inflation target in the medium term, it could be appropriate to raise the NBP interest rates.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 1.50%, the lombard rate at 2.50%, the deposit rate at 0.50% and the rediscount rate at 1.75%.",
        "At the meeting, the members of the Monetary Policy Council discussed monetary policy against the background of macroeconomic developments in Poland and abroad.",
        "The Council reviewed the developments abroad, which have an impact on economic conditions in Poland.",
        "It was recognised that global economic growth remained moderate, but uncertainty about its outlook continued.",
        "It was noted that economic growth in the euro area was stable despite negative impact of weak economic conditions in the non-European emerging market economies.",
        "Attention was drawn to signs of recovery in European and German industrial sector and to a rise in export orders in Germany.",
        "It was stressed that this could support growth in Polish industrial output, particularly export manufacturing.",
        "It was assessed that GDP growth in the United States might have picked up slightly in 2016 Q3, but – like in the previous quarters – had been held back by low investment growth rate.",
        "It was also pointed out that in China GDP growth was lower than in previous years, yet data on activity indicated a stabilisation of economic conditions in the previous months.",
        "At the same time, an opinion was expressed that this stabilisation had been achieved due to significant fiscal expansion and an acceleration in lending growth, which had perpetuated long-term risks for the Chinese economy.",
        "Also in Russia, recession had been alleviated, mainly by the rise in oil prices since the beginning of the year.",
        "The Council members emphasised that prices of oil and many other commodities – despite the rise earlier in the year – were lower than in previous years.",
        "It was also indicated that at the time of the meeting the level of oil prices was close to that in previous year, which implied a near-zero annual price growth rate of oil.",
        "It was judged that low commodity prices and moderate global economic activity had a negative impact on consumer price growth in many economies, though to an increasingly lesser extent.",
        "Some Council members pointed out that a risk of a fall in oil prices stemming from still high supply of oil was a source of uncertainty for the expected price growth, both in Poland and abroad.",
        "They argued that this risk has been increased further in the recent period by a renewed rise in shale oil production in the United States.",
        "Referring to monetary policy abroad, it was highlighted that the European Central Bank was keeping interest rates close to zero, including the deposit rate below zero, and continued financial asset purchases.",
        "At the same time, it was stressed that there were signs of a possible gradual reduction of asset purchases in the future.",
        "It was also pointed out that the Federal Reserve, despite the relatively favourable data on the US economic activity, had not increased interest rates in September and had again revised down their interest rate projections for the coming years.",
        "When discussing developments in the domestic economy, the Council members underlined that stable economic growth continued in Poland.",
        "In particular, the data available at the time of the meeting indicated that GDP growth in 2016 Q3 had probably been close to that in the previous quarter.",
        "The main driver of economic growth is steadily increasing consumer demand, supported by gradual improvement in the labour market, favourable household sentiment and the child benefit payments under the ”Family 500 plus” programme.",
        "It was argued that data on economic activity in August, most notably an increase in retail sales growth, had confirmed such an assessment.",
        "It was also indicated that industrial output had risen markedly in August following a temporary decline in the previous month, and that sentiment in manufacturing had improved significantly.",
        "Attention was also drawn to the balance of payments data, which confirmed the acceleration in export growth in 2016 Q2, despite the fall in world trade volumes observed at that time.",
        "It was also highlighted that fall in construction and assembly output had deepened in August, which – like in the previous months – was most probably due to a decline in investment driven by the temporarily lower absorption of EU funds after expiration of the previous EU financial framework.",
        "Some Council members were of the opinion that the lower investment growth rate might have resulted from uncertainty about the regulatory environment of business in Poland.",
        "During the discussion about the labour market, it was noted that employment had continued to rise steadily, accompanied by a sustained decline in the unemployment rate.",
        "It was highlighted that job vacancies were at historical highs, which indicated ongoing high demand for labour.",
        "It was underlined that the recovery in the labour market was translating into growing wage pressure in the corporate sector, and, in effect, wage growth was already higher than in previous years.",
        "An opinion was expressed that a hike in the minimum wage in early 2017 could be also conducive to faster wage growth in the coming quarters.",
        "While discussing the economic outlook for Poland, the majority of the Council members judged that stable economic growth would most likely continue in the following quarters.",
        "In the opinion of certain Council members, GDP growth could even accelerate slightly.",
        "Growing consumption will remain the major driver of economic growth.",
        "In the further quarters, the economic activity should also be propped up by the expected recovery of investment outlays, including those financed with the EU funds.",
        "To reinforce this view, some Council members cited a significant increase in the number of new EU financial framework contracts signed in the recent quarters.",
        "Certain Council members noted that the favourable outlook for consumer demand and the recent improvement in sentiment in the industrial sector would also support the recovery in corporate investment .",
        "At the same time, in the opinion of certain Council members, over the longer run investment growth might be additionally backed by the \"Housing Plus\" programme.",
        "However, as certain Council members pointed out, due to a deterioration of some sentiment indicators in the previous months and the uncertainty about the regulatory environment of business, it could not be excluded that low investment growth would continue in the coming quarters.",
        "When analysing price developments in Poland, it was underlined that annual consumer price growth remained negative, yet deflation was gradually subsiding.",
        "It was judged that the increase in price growth resulted mainly from dissipating effects of the earlier sharp fall in global commodity prices.",
        "Another factor conducive to higher price growth cited during the meeting was the gradual acceleration in wage growth in Poland, translating into faster growth in unit labour costs.",
        "It was pointed out that the reversal of deflationary trends was also confirmed by the producer price index, in particular net of energy prices, which had been growing since early 2016.",
        "It was also pointed out that the growth rate of consumer prices sensitive to domestic economic conditions had been significantly positive for several months.",
        "The majority of the Council members judged that there were still no visible signs that deflation had affected the activity of most economic agents.",
        "Certain Council members underlined that it was still necessary to analyse the business conditions of enterprises and consumer behaviour for possible adverse effects of the negative price growth.",
        "Referring to the outlook for price growth, the majority of the Council members judged that the scale of deflation would continue to gradually decrease in the coming months.",
        "It was stressed that, according to both NBP’s and external forecasts, the annual price growth rate should be close to 1% in 2017.",
        "It was pointed out that higher price growth would be supported by stable GDP growth, amid accelerating wage growth and higher child benefits.",
        "However, certain Council members were of the opinion that, due to downside risks to oil prices in the global markets, it could not be ruled out that the period of deflation in Poland might extend.",
        "In turn, certain Council members expressed a view that the price growth rate could be higher than indicated by the forecasts available at the time of the meeting.",
        "Stronger acceleration in price growth could, in their opinion, be backed by faster closure of the output gap and higher growth in unit labour costs.",
        "At the same time, these Council members underlined that the impact of unit labour cost growth on price developments could be mitigated for some time if companies reduced their profit margins.",
        "While discussing the level of NBP interest rates, the Council members judged that they should remain unchanged.",
        "The Council members confirmed their assessment that the stabilisation of interest rates helped to keep the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintain macroeconomic stability.",
        "The majority of the Council members pointed out that in 2017 price growth should already be clearly positive.",
        "The majority of the Council members also assessed that GDP growth – though somewhat lower than in 2015 – remained close to potential output growth.",
        "An additional argument for interest rate stabilisation was elevated uncertainty regarding domestic and external conditions for monetary policy.",
        "Some Council members noted that the Council's decisions should also take into account the impact of the interest rates level on the stability of the domestic financial sector.",
        "At the same time, some Council members pointed out that should economic growth accelerate markedly and inflationary pressure appear, creating a risk of exceeding the inflation target in the medium term, it could be appropriate to raise the interest rates.",
        "However, these Council members indicated that, in light of the data available at the time of the meeting, stabilisation of the interest rates in the following quarters was the most likely scenario.",
        "In turn, some Council members assessed that a further slowdown in economic growth, prolonged period of deflation and adverse effects of deflation might justify a decrease in the interest rates in the future.",
        "They emphasised that the reduction in the NBP interest rates would be conducive to higher GDP growth, most notably by boosting investment activity.",
        "Certain Council members underlined in addition that the level of real interest rates in Poland was relatively high compared to other countries in Central and Eastern Europe.",
        "Other Council members judged that the level of NBP interest rates was currently not a factor curbing investment growth in the economy, particularly taking into account high corporate savings allowing firms to finance business activity from their own funds.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 1.50%, the lombard rate at 2.50%, the deposit rate at 0.50%, the rediscount rate at 1.75%.",
        "at a weaker pace than in the previous quarter.",
        "Slower increase in Polish exports was probably attributable to muted economic growth in Poland’s major trading partners, and, as underlined by certain Council members, sluggish growth of global trade.",
        "It was estimated that the annual GDP growth rate would probably remain subdued also in 2016 Q4.",
        "Apart from weak investment activity signalled by the recent data, the lower GDP growth rate would also result from a statistical base effect associated with strong economic growth a year before.",
        "It was emphasised that domestic economic growth was still supported by an increasing pace of consumer demand growth, which in 2016 Q3 had been the fastest in eight years.",
        "Some Council members pointed to a steady increase in housing investment expenditures associated with rising demand for residential real estate.",
        "It was assessed that the acceleration in household expenditures resulted mainly from ongoing improvement in the labour market.",
        "It was indicated that the unemployment rate was the lowest in decades, while employment continued to rise and wages were growing faster than in previous years.",
        "Certain Council members noted that, despite improving labour market conditions, the unemployment rate was still strongly diversified across regions.",
        "It was highlighted that growth in household expenditures was also supported by child benefit payments.",
        "Certain Council members remarked, however, that some of the additional income gained by households from child benefits could be spent on imported goods, leading to acceleration in imports and thereby to lower contribution of net exports to GDP growth.",
        "These Council members emphasised, however, that this effect could be alleviated by higher demand for services, which are characterised with lower import intensity.",
        "The majority of the Council members assessed that the currently observed slowdown in GDP growth was temporary, and that in 2017 economic growth should accelerate.",
        "In the opinion of the Council members, the acceleration in GDP growth should be driven by a further increase in consumption growth and a rebound in investment activity amid gradually strengthening absorption of EU funds.",
        "In this context, surveys were cited that suggested an increase in corporate investment plans.",
        "Certain Council members indicated that economic growth in the coming quarters should also be supported by a faster increase in exports, driven by stronger growth in the environment of the Polish economy and the depreciation of the zloty.",
        "Certain Council members also expressed an opinion that a shortage of qualified staff might prove a barrier to growth for Polish companies in some regions.",
        "According to certain Council members, it could not be ruled out that subdued economic growth would continue until mid-2017.",
        "According to these Council members, GDP growth might still be contained by waning impact of child benefits starting from as soon as 2017 Q2 and the fact that investment cycle for infrastructure projects might be a few quarters long.",
        "These Council members also pointed to a risk of prolonged low export growth stemming from unfavourable developments in global trade, connected i.a.",
        "with a possible increase in protectionism.",
        "Referring to the outlook for economic growth over the longer run, certain Council members highlighted government infrastructure projects, which would prop up the production capacity of the Polish economy.",
        "These members also pointed to a recent decline in migration preference among Polish citizens.",
        "Other Council members indicated a need to boost the labour force participation rate and promote the inflow of foreign workers, which should mitigate the adverse developments associated with population ageing.",
        "When analysing price developments in Poland, it was stressed that annual growth in prices of consumer goods and services had been rising steadily and that deflation had ended in November.",
        "It was pointed out that producer price growth had also been accelerating.",
        "It was assessed that the increase in price growth had resulted mainly from dissipating effects of the earlier sharp fall in global commodity prices.",
        "Additional factor behind the rise in price growth cited during the meeting was the ongoing wage growth, whose pace was faster than in the previous quarters.",
        "However, it was noted that price growth in Poland was contained by low inflation abroad, negative output gap in the domestic economy and low inflation expectations.",
        "The Council members assessed that in the coming quarters price growth would continue to gradually increase, propped up by waned effects of the earlier fall in commodity prices and the expected gradual acceleration in economic growth.",
        "Some Council members also drew attention to intensifying wage pressure indicated by companies, which, along with an increase in the minimum wage in 2017, might boost nominal wage growth.",
        "The Council members were of the opinion that price growth, in spite of the acceleration, would most likely remain low in 2017.",
        "Attention was drawn to the likely stabilization of commodity prices in the coming quarters and limited inflationary pressure at home resulting from significant import intensity of the currently observed growth in consumer demand.",
        "While discussing the level of the NBP interest rates, the Council members judged that they should remain unchanged.",
        "The Council members confirmed their assessment that the stabilisation of the interest rates helped to keep the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintain macroeconomic stability.",
        "The majority of the Council members assessed that an argument for keeping the interest rates unchanged was in particular the gradual increase in price growth.",
        "As a result, despite the nominal interest rates being kept unchanged, their level will decline markedly in real terms.",
        "In the opinion of the Council, an additional argument for the stabilisation of the NBP interest rates was uncertainty regarding domestic and external conditions for monetary policy.",
        "The Council members pointed out that in light of information available at the time of the meeting, stabilisation of the NBP interest rates in the following quarters was the most likely scenario.",
        "This notwithstanding, they indicated that should inflationary pressure appear, creating a risk of exceeding the inflation target in the medium term, it could be appropriate to raise the interest rates.",
        "Certain Council members did not rule out a possibility of a decrease in the interest rates in the event of deepening and protracted economic slowdown.",
        "Other Council members, however, assessed that the level of the NBP interest rates was currently not a factor curbing economic growth in Poland.",
        "For this reason, in the opinion of these Council members, a reduction in the NBP interest rates would have no significant impact on economic activity, however, it could lead to imbalances in the financial and real estate markets as well as to lower household saving rate.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 1.50%, the lombard rate at 2.50%, the deposit rate at 0.50% and the rediscount rate at 1.75%.",
        "At the meeting, the Council members discussed monetary policy against the background of macroeconomic developments in Poland and abroad.",
        "While discussing economic situation abroad, Council members recognised that global economic activity remained moderate.",
        "At the same time, it was stressed that uncertainty regarding the global economic outlook was still elevated.",
        "Council members pointed to continued economic recovery in the euro area.",
        "It was judged that growth in employment and wages in the euro area, as well as rising industrial output and some improvement in economic indicators, signalled further moderate growth in the coming quarters.",
        "It was pointed out that in the United States economic situation remained relatively favourable.",
        "However, it was underlined that recent incoming data made an accurate assessment of the economic prospects of the US economy difficult.",
        "It was emphasised that a source of uncertainty for the economic outlook in developed countries – both in the United States and in the euro area – was the scale of economic slowdown in the emerging economies and its impact on the developed economies.",
        "In this context, attention was drawn to the further deceleration in economic activity in China, indicated by slower growth in industrial output and retail sales as well as a sharp fall in exports.",
        "This notwithstanding, certain Council members drew attention to a slight recovery in investment in the Chinese economy in the recent period, which may be connected with an easing of economic policy and might signal lower risk of a significant economic slowdown in China in the coming quarters.",
        "Referring to the economic situation in other emerging economies, Council members underlined that Russia and Brazil remained in recession.",
        "The possibility of a further fall in energy commodity prices and the cessation of imports of these commodities by some countries was cited by certain members of the Council as a possible risk factor for the improvement in the economic situation in Russia and for the stability of Russia's public finances.",
        "In Brazil the economic outlook could be negatively affected by the deepening political crisis.",
        "When discussing global commodity prices, Council members pointed out that despite a slight increase in the last two months, they remained at a low level.",
        "It was judged that low commodity prices were the key factor behind very low price growth worldwide.",
        "At the same time, attention was drawn to the significant volatility of commodity prices in the recent period and uncertainty regarding their future developments.",
        "Certain Council members expressed the opinion that in the coming months energy commodity prices, including oil, could once again decline.",
        "The factors conducive to possible decrease in prices of these commodities include increased supply of oil associated with the lifting of sanctions on Iranian oil exports in the absence of a significant reduction in oil production in the United States and the possible increase in energy commodity exports from Russia.",
        "However, other Council members were of the opinion that oil prices might increase in the near future, should the OPEC countries and Russia reach an agreement on oil production limits.",
        "It was noted that the increase in commodity prices and some weakening of concerns about global economic situation had improved the sentiment in the global financial markets in the recent period.",
        "As a result, the prices of many financial assets had risen, including share prices and exchange rates of emerging markets currencies.",
        "However, certain Council members judged that the improvement in market sentiment was temporary and that renewed decline in share prices in the global stock markets could not be ruled out in the coming quarters.",
        "When discussing monetary policy abroad, it was pointed out that some central banks in Europe had lowered their interest rates in the recent period.",
        "Certain Council members underlined that currently it was difficult to assess the effectiveness of a further easing of monetary policy, especially considering the external nature of the shocks causing deflation.",
        "At the same time, it was judged that in the United States there was continued uncertainty regarding the future decisions of the Federal Reserve, although in the opinion of the Fed and the financial markets, interest rate hikes were likely in the coming quarters.",
        "In this context, attention was drawn to the risks associated with the withdrawal of the strong monetary expansion.",
        "When discussing the economic situation in Poland, attention was drawn to the continuing stable economic growth in last several quarters.",
        "Some Council members judged that incoming data on industrial production and construction output signalled that GDP growth in 2016 Q1 might have been slightly lower than in the previous quarter, but still remained relatively high.",
        "It was pointed out that economic growth continued to be supported mainly by domestic demand.",
        "The growth of consumer demand was fuelled by rising employment and improving household sentiment.",
        "In turn, investment demand was supported by the sound financial standing of enterprises, their high capacity utilization and the relatively favourable prospects for demand.",
        "Certain Council members emphasized that despite the weakening of foreign demand, Poland had a surplus in trade of goods, which was supported by the high – despite a certain appreciation of the zloty in the recent period – price competitiveness of Polish exports.",
        "However, other Council members stressed that the trade surplus was partly the result of the falling commodity prices in the global markets.",
        "It was noted that the continuing good situation in the real economy was accompanied by a stable growth in lending, including a certain pick-up in growth in corporate credit.",
        "While discussing the situation in the labour market, Council members pointed to the steady growth in employment and the falling unemployment rate, which was close to the pre-crisis level.",
        "It was underlined that despite this, the growth of average nominal wages in the economy was moderate.",
        "This led to continued low growth of unit labour costs.",
        "In addition, certain Council members pointed out that the level of wages most commonly earned by employees was significantly below the average and in the last several years its growth had been slower than that of average wages.",
        "However, other Council members pointed out that the good situation in the labour market was reflected in the relatively high growth of the total wage bill, which was essential for growth of aggregate demand.",
        "While discussing the economic outlook in Poland, Council members judged that the coming quarters were likely to see further stable and relatively fast economic growth.",
        "Certain Council members were of the opinion that GDP growth could even accelerate.",
        "It was pointed out that a factor supporting consumer demand growth would be the further increase in household disposable income resulting from both growing employment and nominal wages and the launch of the “Family 500+” programme.",
        "In turn, growing consumption, which improves the sales outlook of firms, could – according to certain Council members – lead to an acceleration in corporate investment growth.",
        "However, certain Council members pointed out that the propensity of firms to invest could be limited by the continued uncertainty regarding the economic outlook and business conditions.",
        "Certain Council members judged that the stable economic growth and improving labour market situation would lead to a gradual closure of the output gap and the approach of the unemployment rate to the equilibrium rate (NAWRU), which could lead to an increase in domestic demand pressure.",
        "While analysing price developments in Poland, Council members discussed the methods of calculation and properties of particular measures of inflation, analysing, in particular, the influence of changes in the structure of the CPI basket on consumer price growth.",
        "Council members also analysed price developments in particular categories of goods and services and discussed the possible causes of the long-term fall in prices of some of those categories.",
        "Referring to the current data, Council members pointed out that price growth remained negative.",
        "However, Council members emphasised that the continued deflation was still mainly driven by external factors – including the earlier fall in global commodity prices – which were beyond the direct impact of Poland's monetary policy.",
        "It was pointed out that the negative impact of external factors on domestic prices was so strong that it caused the core inflation indicators to fall below zero.",
        "However, it was underlined that these factors mainly reduced the prices of goods, while price growth of services remained positive.",
        "At the same time, it was stressed that there was still no wage pressure in the economy.",
        "Some Council members pointed out that the continued deflation had not so far adversely affected the decisions of economic agents.",
        "In particular, it was underlined that it did not lead to the postponement of purchases by households or deferral of corporate investment.",
        "Certain Council members also pointed out that although inflation expectations of economic agents were running at a very low level, households failed to notice the fall in the general level of consumer prices.",
        "However, other Council members judged that the prolonged period of deflation might increase the risk of a permanent deanchoring of inflation expectations, which might in turn have an adverse impact on the effectiveness of monetary policy in the future.",
        "Council members underlined that at the end of 2016 price growth was expected to become positive.",
        "It was pointed out that growing consumer demand, supported by the \"Family 500+\" programme, as well as the expected increase in growth of unit labour costs resulting from the improvement in the labour market situation would contribute to increase in price growth.",
        "However, other Council members pointed out that the further fall in global energy commodity prices expected by these Council members and a reduction in the price of imported goods caused by appreciation of the zloty might have a negative effect on price growth in the coming quarters.",
        "In this context, attention was drawn to a certain strengthening of the zloty in recent months caused, among others, by the ECB's easing of monetary policy.",
        "Certain Council members stressed that in the medium term the increase in price growth might also be curtailed by growth in production capacity in the economy resulting from rising investment.",
        "Referring to the level of interest rates in the economy, some Council members judged that the interest rate on corporate loans was currently relatively low.",
        "Certain Council members expressed the opinion that the cost of credit was not a factor curbing lending growth.",
        "In turn, other Council members pointed out that the low level of interest rates might reduce household demand for long-term savings instruments and thus limit the development of the domestic financial market.",
        "While discussing the level of NBP interest rates, Council members decided that they should remain unchanged at the current meeting.",
        "Council members stressed that the continued negative price growth was mainly caused by external factors and deflation had no adverse effects on the decisions of economic agents.",
        "As a result, low price growth was accompanied by stable and relatively fast economic growth and steady tightening of the labour market.",
        "Certain Council members also underlined that the stabilisation of nominal interest rates amidst expected increase in price growth over the coming year would lead to a decline in real interest rates.",
        "Council members judged that in these conditions a stabilisation of interest rates helped to keep the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path.",
        "In addition, some Council members drew attention to the need to take into account the impact of the level of interest rates on the risk to financial stability.",
        "Council members judged that the increased uncertainty regarding the domestic and external developments also spoke in favour of a stabilisation of interest rates.",
        "In this context, attention was drawn to the uncertainty regarding the outlook for fiscal policy in 2017, fears about a global economic slowdown and the risk of financial turmoil caused, among others, by the possible decision of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union.",
        "In the opinion of certain Council members, stabilisation of interest rates, which – in the face of monetary policy easing by central banks in the environment of the Polish economy – causes an increased differential between domestic and foreign rates, might reduce the vulnerability of both Polish assets and the exchange rate to a possible increase in risk aversion in the financial markets and a deterioration of investor sentiment.",
        "Council members also argued that the stabilisation of interest rates ensured the room for their adjustment in the case of shocks adversely affecting the domestic economic situation and price developments.",
        "The majority of Council members did not rule out the possibility of interest rate cuts in the case of an economic slowdown in Poland and deepening deflation.",
        "Certain Council members argued that given the current level of interest rates – should interest rate cuts turned out to be necessary – a sharper interest rate adjustment would be possible.",
        "In turn, certain Council members expressed the opinion that taking into account the relatively high GDP growth and the favourable outlook for economic growth, additionally supported by the reduced restrictiveness of fiscal policy, it would be justified to keep interest rates unchanged in the coming quarters.",
        "This assessment might even require considering the circumstances for a change in the monetary policy stance.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 1.50%, the lombard rate at 2.50%, the deposit rate at 0.50%, the rediscount rate at 1.75%.",
        "At the meeting, the Council members discussed monetary policy against the background of macroeconomic developments in Poland and abroad as well as the results of the March projection of inflation and GDP.",
        "When discussing economic activity abroad, the Council members recognized that global economic activity remained moderate and that the uncertainty about its outlook had recently increased.",
        "It was noted that in the major advanced economies, i.e.",
        "in the United States and the euro area, consumer expenditure growth remained stable, as labour market conditions continued to improve.",
        "It was pointed out, however, that GDP growth in both economies was constrained by low investment growth and a slowdown in exports.",
        "It was underlined that slower export growth, particularly in the case of the euro area, resulted from weaker conditions in the major emerging market economies, particularly China.",
        "It was added that conditions in global industry were very volatile and deteriorating.",
        "Exports had weakened also in Germany, and – in association with this – conditions in German industry had ebbed.",
        "This might be conducive to lower growth in Polish exports and industrial production, as Polish and German industries cooperate closely within global supply chains.",
        "At the same time, it was stressed that in spite of weaker exports, German economy continued to recover, supported by ongoing domestic demand growth, partly stimulated by increased public expenditures.",
        "The Council members judged that the uncertainty about the global economic outlook had particularly increased in recent months.",
        "This uncertainty results from the risk of a stronger deterioration in economic conditions in China and other emerging market economies, as well as the extent to which this weakening would translate into activity in the advanced economies.",
        "In this context, it was pointed out that many international institutions had revised their forecasts for global economic growth downwards.",
        "Certain Council members expressed the opinion that these revisions could be associated with the downtrend in financial asset prices in the advanced and emerging market economies which had been observed for several months.",
        "The Council members stressed that energy and agricultural commodity prices – in spite of their recent rebound – were still low, which is the main reason for low consumer and producer price growth worldwide.",
        "Certain Council members pointed to factors which could contribute to lower commodity prices over the longer run.",
        "that gas prices might decline further, as several producers of this commodity suggested an increase in its exports.",
        "Some Council members, in turn, drew attention to geopolitical tensions, arguing that their increase could lead to higher prices of commodities, particularly of crude oil.",
        "It was highlighted that the uncertainty about the global economy was affecting financial market sentiment, which in recent months had been reflected by capital outflows from many emerging market economies and the resultant fall in financial asset prices in these countries as well as the depreciation of their currencies.",
        "Attention was drawn to the significant depreciation of the zloty, the fall in share prices on the Polish stock exchange and the outflow of capital from the government bond market.",
        "This notwithstanding, the Council members underlined that investor sentiment had improved in recent weeks, which resulted i.a.",
        "in an appreciation of the zloty.",
        "It was pointed out that the likelihood of the major central banks maintaining their expansionary monetary policy for longer than previously expected had increased over recent months.",
        "It was noted that the ECB had again expanded its monetary policy, in particular by lowering the deposit rate to a more negative level and significantly increasing the scale of its monthly asset purchases.",
        "It was also outlined that in the United States, in spite of an increase in interest rates in December 2015, the uncertainty about the direction of the Fed’s monetary policy had risen of late.",
        "The Council members pointed to likely consequences of further monetary easing by the ECB on the Polish economy.",
        "It was highlighted that it might be conducive to a decline in Polish government bond yields and an appreciation of the zloty.",
        "However, as certain members pointed out, the zloty was broadly stable over the course of the ECB’s asset purchase programme.",
        "Some Council members expressed the opinion that the reduction in the ECB deposit rate to a more negative level might create a risk of higher foreign capital inflow to the Polish banking sector, although the extent of the risks associated with this is hard to assess for the time being.",
        "While analysing the current domestic economic conditions, it was highlighted that – in spite of the rise in external risks – stable economic growth in Poland continued and in 2015 Q4 GDP growth had even accelerated slightly.",
        "It was also stressed that domestic demand continued to be the key driver of GDP growth.",
        "It was highlighted that investment expenditure had accelerated in 2015 Q4, which had been accompanied by stable growth in consumption.",
        "Consumer expenditures are supported by improving labour market conditions, reflected particularly in rising employment and a fall in the unemployment rate, which had reached the lowest level since 2008.",
        "Moreover, as certain Council members underlined, consumer demand growth was also supported by an improvement in consumer sentiment.",
        "Investment demand, in turn, is propped up by sound financial standing of enterprises and the capacity utilization above the long-run average.",
        "It was also outlined that Polish exports continued to grow and sentiment in Polish industry remained positive, even though German exports and industrial conditions had weakened of late.",
        "It was also pointed out that moderate loan growth also contributed to stable domestic demand growth.",
        "Certain Council members noted in addition that surveys of the Polish enterprise sector did not point to limited access to external financing as a major hurdle for corporate investment.",
        "Discussing the economic outlook for Poland, it was highlighted that in line with the March GDP projection, GDP growth should remain stable in the coming years.",
        "It was noted that consumer demand growth was forecasted to accelerate, propped up by rising employment and an increase in wage growth, as well as a boost to government transfers to households resulting from the introduction of the “Family 500+” programme.",
        "Certain Council members expressed the opinion that higher consumer demand growth could translate also into an acceleration in investment.",
        "Rising investment, in turn, should increase the productive capacity of the Polish economy, which could alleviate inflationary pressure that might appear in the medium term due to an increase in consumer demand growth.",
        "These members also outlined that an acceleration in domestic demand might lead to wider current account deficit and greater external imbalances, particularly given moderate growth in economic activity abroad.",
        "Reviewing price developments in Poland, attention was drawn to still negative price growth, which – similarly to other countries – was mainly due to the fall in commodity prices in recent quarters.",
        "Low inflation in Poland’s major trading partners is another factor behind lower consumer price growth.",
        "It was highlighted that consumer price growth in the Polish economy was also lowered by a lack of wage pressure, which persists in spite of a notable improvement in the labour market.",
        "In this context, some Council members noted that unit labour cost growth had been slow for some time.",
        "In addition, certain Council members expressed the opinion that embargo imposed by Russia on Polish food products had been conducive to lower food prices in Poland.",
        "These members also pointed to an ongoing fall in apparel prices, which – in their opinion – might be further exacerbated by softer demand of foreign consumers caused by i.a.",
        "recession in Russia and Ukraine as well as a sharp depreciation of their currencies.",
        "During the discussion on the results of the March inflation projection, it was highlighted that, according to this projection, price growth should turn positive in 2016 Q4 and return to the tolerance band within two years.",
        "At the same time, it was noted that core inflation was projected to gradually increase, supported by an acceleration in domestic demand, an expected rise in wage growth as well as higher consumer expenditure of households resulting from the introduction of the “Family 500+” programme.",
        "Certain Council members underlined in addition that the negative impact of the fall in commodity prices should be fading out, which would be conducive to higher CPI inflation later in the projection horizon.",
        "According to some Council members, an acceleration in price growth, stemming from faster growth in consumer demand and good labour market conditions, might prove faster than forecasted in the projection.",
        "Discussing the effects of negative price growth in Poland, some Council members emphasized that no negative developments associated with deflation had been observed so far.",
        "In particular, households and enterprises do not hold off their consumption and investment expenditures.",
        "Certain members outlined that the risk of a prolonged period of deflation in Poland was low due to very good labour market conditions, which result in stable nominal price growth.",
        "Other Council members assessed in turn that the risk that economic agents will start to postpone their expenditures increases as the period of negative price growth extends.",
        "Therefore, the Council members decided that the impact of low price growth on the behaviour of economic agents in Poland should be monitored further.",
        "Referring to the interest rates in the context of direct inflation targeting, the Council decided that they should remain unchanged at the current meeting.",
        "The Council members indicated that the currently observed low price growth was mainly due to factors beyond the influence of domestic monetary policy.",
        "However, in the coming quarters, CPI growth would be supported by a steady increase in domestic economic activity.",
        "This assessment is backed by the results of the March projection of inflation and GDP.",
        "The Council members confirmed their assessment that – given the available data and forecasts – the current level of interest rates helped to keep the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and to maintain macroeconomic stability.",
        "The Council members stressed that the elevated uncertainty regarding external conditions, more notably persisting risks to global economic activity and volatile financial market sentiment, also spoke in favour of a stabilization of the interest rates.",
        "Other important monetary policy determinant was the uncertainty about the outlook for fiscal policy beyond 2016.",
        "The Council members also judged that decisions on the interest rates should take into account their potential impact on the stability of the domestic financial sector.",
        "The majority of the Council members expressed the opinion that under these conditions keeping interest rates at the current level ensured room for monetary policy easing in the event of negative shocks, which would result in a deterioration in economic conditions and lower price growth.",
        "Certain Council members did not rule out a necessity for lowering the interest rates should indications of negative developments associated with deflationary processes occur, even though they assessed their probability as low.",
        "Certain Council members indicated in turn that in the coming quarters it might be justified to consider the circumstances under which the monetary policy stance could be reexamined.",
        "This could be justified if inflationary pressure appeared as a result of favourable labour market conditions and expected acceleration in consumer demand.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 1.50%, the lombard rate at 2.50%, the deposit rate at 0.50%, the rediscount rate at 1.75%.",
        "At the meeting, members of the Monetary Policy Council discussed monetary policy against the background of macroeconomic developments in Poland and abroad as well as the results of the July projection of inflation and GDP.",
        "During the discussion on external economic conditions, it was observed that global economic growth remained moderate and uncertainty about its outlook remained.",
        "It was highlighted that a significant part of this uncertainty came from the voting results of the United Kingdom's (UK’s) European Union (EU) referendum.",
        "It was noted that in the euro area economic recovery continued and data releases on employment and consumer sentiment were supportive of the outlook for consumption.",
        "At the same time, it was stressed that the UK’s decision to withdraw from the EU had led to an increase in downside risks to economic outlook in the euro area.",
        "Yet, certain Council members argued that the uncertainty arising from the UK’s future exit from the EU might be concentrated in the British economy and its immediate environment.",
        "It was stated that an in-depth assessment of the impact of the UK's departure from the EU on global economic conditions would be possible only after its conditions and timing had been determined.",
        "Referring to developments in the United States, it was noted that moderate GDP growth in this country continued, but the economic outlook was difficult to assess.",
        "In this context, it was underlined that consumer expenditure and retail sales continued to rise, but, at the same time, labour market data were weaker than expected and industrial output continued to decline.",
        "The Council members emphasised that energy commodity prices – despite a recent uptick – remained considerably lower than in previous years.",
        "Certain Council members judged that there were no signs of renewed decline in energy commodity prices in the near future.",
        "However, they stressed that a falling trend in oil and financial asset prices could not be completely ruled out, which could point to a deterioration in the global economic outlook.",
        "It was pointed out that low commodity prices, coupled with moderate global economic activity, were the main factors of extremely weak consumer price growth in many economies, including the euro area.",
        "It was observed that under such circumstances the European Central Bank (ECB) maintained its policy interest rates near zero and had launched a corporate bond purchase programme in June.",
        "Some Council members took the view that given an intensification of downside risks to the economic outlook for the euro area, the period in which ECB interest rates are kept very low might be extended.",
        "In the United States, in turn, the interest rates had been left unchanged, but mixed signals about economic activity in this economy were adding to the uncertainty about the future decisions of the Federal Reserve.",
        "When analysing the developments in global financial markets, the Council members drew attention to an increase in risk aversion following the announcement of the UK’s EU referendum results.",
        "The rise in risk aversion was demonstrated in depreciation of exchange rates and a decline in asset prices in many economies, including Poland.",
        "The Council members pointed out that the market reaction to this event, while relatively strong, was short-lived.",
        "Certain Council members underlined that the zloty exchange rate fluctuations in response to external shocks – such as the outcome of the UK vote – might cushion the impact of those shocks on economic conditions in Poland.",
        "While discussing the developments in Poland’s real economy, the Council members assessed that GDP growth – having decelerated in 2016 Q1 – had probably picked up slightly in the following quarter.",
        "It was assessed that the increase in GDP growth had probably been driven by accelerating consumption, supported by the relatively robust growth of the wage bill, the launch of payments under the \"Family 500 plus\" programme, as well as higher – compared to the previous quarter – EU’s Common Agricultural Policy direct payments.",
        "It was observed that while higher disposable income of households had not yet translated into more robust retail sales growth, it might have stimulated consumer expenditure not included in the present data, such as spending on services.",
        "Some Council members believed that following a decline in investment in the previous quarter, investment growth in 2016 Q2 was probably slow or even negative, as the uncertainty about future conditions for business activity remained and absorption of EU funds under the new EU financial framework was slow.",
        "Referring to longer-term investment trends, certain Council members emphasised the low share of investment in GDP, which – given the prospect of declining labour supply due to the population ageing – might adversely affect economic growth in the future.",
        "The Council members underlined the sound labour market conditions reflected in high employment and a low unemployment rate.",
        "Yet, certain Council members noted that despite these favourable developments, the wage share in GDP in Poland was smaller than in most EU member states.",
        "With reference to the long-term outlook for the labour market, other Council members judged that this market was being distorted by low labour force participation rate.",
        "However, these members observed that the problem might be mitigated by a gradual increase in labour force participation among the oldest cohorts.",
        "When discussing the economic outlook for Poland, the Council members assessed that after a temporary weakening in 2016 Q1, GDP growth would remain stable in the coming quarters, as suggested also in the July projection.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that GDP growth in the July projection was substantially lower compared to the previous forecasting round.",
        "A majority of the Council members expected GDP growth to turn out slightly higher than in the July projection.",
        "Certain Council members highlighted the fact that the downward shift in the GDP growth path in the July projection resulted partly from the inclusion of weaker real economy data from 2016 Q1, which – considering their temporary nature – should have little impact on activity growth in the quarters to come.",
        "In the opinion of the Council members, economic growth will continue to be primarily supported by a rise in consumption, which is likely to accelerate.",
        "Increasing consumer demand will be supported by higher disposable income of households resulting from the expanding wage bill and the disbursement of child benefits.",
        "The announced rise in the minimum wage might prove another factor supportive of consumption growth in the following years, as – in the opinion of certain Council members – it could translate into higher wages for better-paid employees.",
        "Other Council members argued, in turn, that the scale of the impact from the rise in the minimum wage on employment level was uncertain.",
        "With reference to the outlook for investment, some the Council members assessed that investment growth would probably accelerate in the following quarters.",
        "In this context, attention was drawn to good financial standing of Polish companies, their high capacity utilisation and a prospect of higher absorption of EU funds under the new EU framework as expected by certain Council members already in the second half of 2016.",
        "Certain Council members were of the opinion that, over longer run, investment and, to a lesser extent, consumption might be supported by an announced government scheme for rental housing construction (“Housing Plus”).",
        "Other Council members held the view that assessment of investment outlook in the coming quarters was complicated due to the uncertainty regarding the pace of EU funds spending and firms' propensity to invest, as well as the extent of the \"Housing Plus\" scheme.",
        "When assessing the potential impact of the UK’s withdrawal from the EU on the Polish economy, it was underlined this assessment was subject to high uncertainty.",
        "Some Council members expressed an opinion that the impact of the UK's exit from the EU on Poland’s economic activity would probably be limited.",
        "The effects of any changes in the conditions for trade exchange and the access to the UK labour market were also judged limited and extended over time.",
        "Certain Council members highlighted the fact that the impact of weaker external economic conditions resulting from the UK’s vote on Polish exports would be mitigated by the recently observed depreciation of the zloty.",
        "Yet, certain Council members pointed out that should the zloty appreciate, export growth might decelerate, which – given the expected sharp increase in domestic demand, fuelling import growth – might lead to current account imbalance.",
        "Other Council members believed that elevated uncertainty related to the UK's decision might encourage investors to redirect capital from the UK to other European economies, including Poland.",
        "While analysing price developments in Poland, it was stressed that price growth remained negative, but deflation had slowed down somewhat in June.",
        "It was emphasised that this was accompanied by a slight rise in core inflation measures and a marked weakening in the pace of decline in producer prices.",
        "It was also noted that wage growth in the corporate sector had risen recently, which might be a sign of accelerating wage growth in the whole economy.",
        "The majority of the Council members were of the opinion that the ongoing deflation had not yet adversely affected the decisions of economic agents.",
        "Certain Council members additionally expressed the view that due to the stable – though low– inflation expectations of economic agents, the risk of negative effects of deflation materialising in the future was also limited.",
        "In turn, certain Council members held the view that the ongoing deflation could be one of the factors dragging on corporate investment activity.",
        "These members indicated that due to deflation borrowing costs in real terms were higher than in nominal terms.",
        "In their opinion, deflation has been also adding to the uncertainty about future profitability of corporate activity, which might deteriorate the assessment of the outlook for the corporate sector.",
        "Other Council members noted, however, that relatively mild deflation might only discourage projects with a low expected rate of return.",
        "Yet, certain Council members were of the opinion that the decline in prices might increase firms' propensity to launch modernisation investment projects, as falling sales prices encourage labour productivity improvements and reduction in costs.",
        "With respect to the outlook for price growth, it was observed that in line with the July projection it should increase above zero in the last quarter of 2016 and return near the lower bound for deviations from the target in 2017 Q2.",
        "The opinion was expressed that the path for price growth in the July projection – despite the output gap closing more slowly than expected – was only marginally weaker than previously anticipated.",
        "It was emphasised that price growth might be boosted by the weaker zloty exchange rate, higher child benefits and the forecasted acceleration in wage growth, additionally supported by the announced rise in the minimum wage.",
        "While discussing decisions concerning the NBP interest rates, the Council judged that they should remain unchanged at the July meeting.",
        "A majority of the Council members pointed out that deflation was not adversely affecting decisions of economic agents and within one year and a half price growth was expected to have approximated the lower bound for deviations from the inflation target.",
        "Furthermore, in the opinion of the Council members, sustainable economic activity growth would be continued in the coming quarters.",
        "It was observed that weakening in external demand, if any, would be offset by expanding domestic demand, additionally supported by looser fiscal policy.",
        "The Council members confirmed that against this background stabilisation of interest rates helped to keep the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintain macroeconomic balance.",
        "An additional argument for interest rate stabilisation was – in the opinion of the Council members – the elevated uncertainty surrounding domestic and external conditions for monetary policy.",
        "Some Council members pointed out that the Council's decision should also take into account the impact of the interest rates level on the stability of the domestic financial sector.",
        "Some Council members did not rule out the possibility of an interest rate decrease in the future should domestic economic growth weaken considerably, or in the event of deeper deflation or signs of its negative impact on the behaviour of economic agents.",
        "Certain Council members suggested that an interest rate cut might be justified already in the following few quarters.",
        "They argued that the interest rate on corporate and household loans remained high in comparison with other European countries, and its reduction – which would be supported by a cut in the NBP interest rates – would be conducive to higher GDP growth, most notably by boosting investment activity growth.",
        "In contrast, other Council members judged that the present interest rate on investment lending was already low, with an interest rate cut possibly triggering the launch of projects with a low expected rate of return.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 1.50%, the lombard rate at 2.50%, the deposit rate at 0.50%, the rediscount rate at 1.75%.",
        "At the meeting, the Council members discussed monetary policy against the background of macroeconomic developments in Poland and abroad.",
        "The Council reviewed the developments abroad, which are relevant for economic conditions in Poland.",
        "It was recognised that global economic growth remained moderate, but the uncertainty about its outlook continued.",
        "It was noted that economic growth in the euro area was stable and emphasised that in Germany – Poland's main trading partner – in 2016 Q2 it was higher than expected despite a certain slowdown.",
        "GDP growth in this country has been supported by stable rise in consumption driven by improving labour market conditions and high public expenditure growth.",
        "A number of factors, which had a negative impact on economic activity in the euro area, particularly on investment expenditure, were cited.",
        "Attention was drawn to weak economic conditions in non-European emerging market economies, low growth in global industrial production and trade, and the uncertainty regarding the situation in the banking sector in several euro area member states.",
        "It was underlined that – contrary to previous concerns – the uncertainty related to the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union had not yet had a significant impact on economic activity in Britain or the euro area.",
        "With reference to developments in the United States, it was noted that conditions in the US labour market had improved, which had eased concerns about persistent deterioration in economic conditions in this country.",
        "However, it was highlighted that GDP growth in the United States was lower than in previous years due to a fall in investment, particularly in the oil extraction industry, related to earlier sharp fall in oil prices, and to slower export growth amid moderate global economic growth and relatively strong US dollar.",
        "Regarding the emerging market economies, the Council members noted that the economic activity indicators pointed to further slowdown in China.",
        "At the same time, it was assessed that temporary stabilisation of GDP growth in China in 2016 Q2 had been achieved thanks to significant fiscal expansion and an acceleration in lending growth, which had perpetuated long-term risks for the Chinese economy.",
        "It was pointed out that the recession in Russia was gradually receding, though economic conditions in this country would most likely stay weak.",
        "The Council members emphasized that the prices of oil and many other commodities remained lower than in previous years.",
        "It was indicated that low commodity prices, along with moderate global economic activity, were the main factors behind the low consumer price growth in many economies.",
        "The Council members pointed out that against this background, the European Central Bank was keeping interest rates close to zero, including the deposit rate below zero, and continued financial asset purchases.",
        "It was pointed out that although the Federal Reserve had indicated a possible interest rate increase in the future, there was a considerable uncertainty about its timing.",
        "An opinion was expressed that this uncertainty had a negative impact on financial market sentiment.",
        "However, it was highlighted that global financial asset prices had risen since the previous Council meeting, which was due to lower concerns regarding the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union.",
        "When discussing developments in Poland’s real economy, the Council members pointed to a slight increase in GDP growth in 2016 Q2.",
        "It was noted that economic growth – although somewhat lower than in 2015 – was close to potential output growth, which does not result in imbalances building up in the economy.",
        "It was stressed that the main factor behind the growth in 2016 Q2 had been still a steady increase in consumer demand, supported by favourable consumer sentiment and gradual improvement in the labour market, translating into an acceleration in wage growth in 2016 Q2.",
        "It was recognised that higher growth in consumption could also be driven by the launch of the \"Family 500 plus\" programme, although the scale of its impact on consumption growth was hard to assess at the time of the meeting.",
        "Another factor contributing to higher GDP growth in 2016 Q2 was significant acceleration in exports.",
        "However, the Council members observed that GDP growth had been contained by the fall in investment, caused mainly by temporarily lower EU funds absorption after the previous EU financial framework had expired.",
        "As some Council members argued, the same factor stood behind a fall in investment in other Central and Eastern European economies.",
        "In addition, some Council members pointed out that the uncertainty regarding the legal environment of business could also be contributing to weaker investment growth.",
        "While discussing the economic outlook in Poland, the Council members judged that stable economic growth would continue in the coming quarters and – in the opinion of some Council members – it could even accelerate slightly.",
        "The Council members assessed that consumption would remain the major driver of economic growth.",
        "It was stressed that although in early 2016 Q3 retail sales growth was still moderate, incoming data, including data on wages, and also the growth in consumer sentiment indicators, suggested that consumption was likely to accelerate further.",
        "Growth in consumption in the coming quarters should also be driven by emerging effects of an acceleration in disbursement of the child benefits.",
        "Some Council members pointed out that stable consumption growth could be insufficient for keeping GDP growth close to the currently observed level in 2017.",
        "For this reason, investment outlays would be crucial for GDP growth remaining close to the level observed at the time of the meeting.",
        "Referring to the investment outlook, some Council members judged that in 2017 investment growth would most likely pick up, supported by an increase in the EU funds absorption amid good financial standing of enterprises and growing capacity utilisation of firms.",
        "Some Council members pointed out that in the longer run investment growth should be additionally supported by government infrastructure projects, including those implemented under the Responsible Development Plan.",
        "In the opinion of some Council members, investment growth in the coming quarters is, however, fraught with uncertainty.",
        "Certain Council members pointed out that investment could rise slower than expected in the July projection due to i.a.",
        "the uncertainty about economic growth outlook for Poland and abroad, the uncertainty about the timing of an acceleration in the EU funds absorption as well as the uncertainty regarding the legal environment of business.",
        "Some Council members noted in addition that – due to fiscal convergence criterion on the level of the general government deficit – increasing public spending needed to co-finance investments within the new EU financial framework might prove difficult.",
        "When analysing price developments in Poland, it was stressed that the annual consumer price index remained negative, yet signs of a reversal in deflationary trends had appeared.",
        "In particular, attention was drawn to the increase in the GDP deflator and the growth of consumer prices influenced by domestic economic conditions.",
        "Attention was also drawn to the signs of cost pressure in the economy, manifested in the positive and rising growth in producer prices excluding energy and an acceleration in unit labour cost growth.",
        "The majority of the Council members underlined that there were no visible signs that the current deflation had a negative impact on the activity of economic agents.",
        "However, certain Council members pointed out that there was considerable uncertainty regarding the potential effects of deflation.",
        "Taking this into account, the Council members underlined that it was necessary to continue to analyse the business conditions of enterprises and consumer behaviour for possible adverse effects of the negative price growth.",
        "Referring to the outlook for price growth, it was pointed out that in the coming months the annual consumer price index would remain negative, although the scale of deflation would be gradually subsiding due to dissipating effects of the earlier drop in global commodity prices.",
        "It was emphasised that higher price growth in the coming quarters would also be supported by stable GDP growth and further acceleration in wage growth.",
        "As a consequence – in the opinion of the majority of the Council members – in 2017 price growth would be materially positive.",
        "However, certain Council members did not rule out that deflation in Poland could last longer.",
        "It was stressed that the main source of uncertainty for growth outlook came from a possibility of a deterioration of the global economic conditions and of a fall in commodity prices, which would reduce price growth in the environment of the Polish economy and thus also domestic price growth.",
        "While discussing the NBP interest rates, the Council members judged that they should remain unchanged.",
        "The majority of the Council members pointed out that – given the available data at the time of the meeting – deflation was not adversely affecting decisions of economic agents.",
        "Moreover, in 2017 price growth should already be clearly positive.",
        "The majority of the Council members also pointed out that GDP growth – despite some deceleration compared to the previous year – remained close to the potential growth rate, and in 2017 it was expected to accelerate.",
        "The Council members confirmed their assessment that against this background stabilisation of interest rates helped to keep the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintain macroeconomic stability.",
        "An additional argument for interest rate stabilisation was – in the opinion of the Council members – the elevated uncertainty regarding domestic and external conditions for monetary policy.",
        "At the same time, some Council members assessed that a further slowdown in economic growth, prolonged period of deflation and adverse effects of deflation might be a justification for a decrease in the interest rates in the future.",
        "Certain Council members suggested that the interest rate cut could be justified already in the following few quarters.",
        "They emphasised that the reduction in the NBP interest rates would be conducive to higher GDP growth, most notably by boosting investment activity growth.",
        "However, other Council members judged that the level of interest rates on loans was not currently a factor curbing investment growth in the economy.",
        "For this reason – in the opinion of these Council members – the reduction in the NBP interest rates could not have a limited impact on economic activity; however, it could lead to imbalances in the financial and real estate markets.",
        "At the same time, some Council members pointed out that should economic growth accelerate markedly and inflationary pressure appear, creating a risk of exceeding the inflation target in the medium term, it could be appropriate to raise the interest rates.",
        "However, these Council members indicated that in light of the current forecasts, stabilisation of the interest rates in the future was the most likely scenario.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 1.50%, the lombard rate at 2.50%, the deposit rate at 0.50%, the rediscount rate at 1.75%.",
        "At the meeting, the members of the Monetary Policy Council discussed monetary policy against the background of macroeconomic developments in Poland and abroad.",
        "While discussing the economic conditions abroad, Council members recognised that global economic growth remained moderate, amid continuing uncertainty about its outlook.",
        "GDP growth in the euro area picked up in 2016 Q1, although it was judged that this acceleration was likely to be temporary because of a further drag from weak economic conditions in emerging economies.",
        "At the same time, it was stressed that despite these unfavourable external developments, in recent months there had been a marked improvement in the export sector in Germany, Poland's main trading partner.",
        "This improvement – along with a further recovery of German domestic demand – resulted in a pick-up in economic growth in Germany.",
        "Council members drew attention to the persisting sources of uncertainty for economic conditions and political situation in the euro area countries and the remaining EU economies.",
        "Among these, they mentioned the possible decision of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union, political developments in France and Spain, the possible re-intensification of Greece's debt problem and the immigration crisis.",
        "Certain Council members also pointed to the uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of the ECB's measures undertaken to stimulate economic activity in the euro area.",
        "Council members indicated that the United States expected to see further moderate economic growth, supported mainly by rising consumption.",
        "At the same time, attention was drawn to recent information from the labour market and services market, which might indicate that the outlook for the US economy was worse than previously anticipated.",
        "As a result, uncertainty remains about the timing of further interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.",
        "Referring to the economic conditions in the major emerging economies, it was pointed out that in China recent data on industrial output, retail sales and investment indicated a further slowdown in economic activity.",
        "In turn, in Russia – according to the national accounts data – the fall in GDP was weaker in 2016 Q1.",
        "Certain Council members stressed that the higher global energy commodity prices had a positive impact on the outlook for the Russian economy, although this might be limited by the reduction in imports of energy commodities from Russia announced by some European countries.",
        "Council members underlined that energy commodity prices – despite some increase in recent months – were still markedly lower than in previous years.",
        "Low commodity prices, combined with moderate global economic activity, were the main factors behind very low consumer price growth in many economies.",
        "When analysing the economic conditions in Poland, Council members drew attention to the slowdown in GDP growth in 2016 Q1.",
        "Council members noted that it was mainly driven by the fall in total investment outlays, including weaker corporate investment activity.",
        "The decline in investment was partly related to the completion of projects cofinanced with EU funds under the previous financial framework as well as statistical effects related to the implementation of large investments in the energy sector in 2016 Q1.",
        "Some Council members judged that uncertainty regarding future business conditions, persuading firms to postpone investment projects, might have contributed to the slowdown in corporate investment.",
        "Certain Council members also pointed out that a certain weakening in export growth had a negative impact on GDP growth in 2016 Q1.",
        "Other Council members judged that the slowdown in GDP might have partly reflected the relatively low growth in economic activity in March 2016, which was related to fewer working days than in the corresponding month a year before.",
        "It was underlined that GDP growth in 2016 Q1 was mainly driven by stable growth in consumer demand and an increase in stocks.",
        "Rising consumption was supported, in particular, by robust labour market with record high employment and historically low unemployment rate.",
        "In this context, some Council members judged that the level of employment might be even higher than indicated by official statistics, which do not include a significant number of employees from Ukraine.",
        "Certain Council members underlined that the growth in employment was supported by increased economic activity of older people and longer period in which people at retirement age continue their employment.",
        "In turn, other Council members judged that the growth in employment in recent months could partly result from the imposition of social security contributions on civil law contracts, leading to changes in the forms of employment of some employees.",
        "Certain Council members expressed the opinion that although the average unemployment rate in Poland was low, in certain parts of the country it remained relatively high.",
        "While discussing the outlook for economic activity, the majority of Council members judged that the fall in GDP growth in 2016 Q1 was temporary.",
        "Some Council members pointed out that GDP growth should pick up in the coming quarters, although it would probably be somewhat lower than expected in the March projection.",
        "In the opinion of certain Council members, in the following quarters GDP growth might be curbed by the low growth in investment, partly related to the uncertainty regarding the future economic developments.",
        "Other Council members were of the opinion that GDP growth could increase markedly and exceed the forecast as early as in 2016 Q2.",
        "In this context, they pointed to the significant acceleration in industrial output and the further improvement in labour market conditions in April.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that the relatively high GDP growth in the coming quarters should be supported by increasing consumption growth amidst ongoing strengthening in the labour market, favourable household sentiment, and the start of family benefit payments under the \"Family 500+\" programme.",
        "Some Council members judged that the investment outlook also remained relatively favourable.",
        "They pointed to the high capacity utilisation of companies and their sound financial standing, as well as the possible disbursement of funds under the new EU financial framework in the second half of 2016.",
        "It was underlined that the possible launch of the recently announced government programme supporting investment might have boosted investment growth, although its form and timing were uncertain.",
        "Taking into account the above-mentioned factors, it was indicated that the output gap would close within the monetary policy transmission horizon.",
        "However, certain Council members underlined that an exact assessment of the economic outlook for the coming quarters was made more difficult due to the heightened uncertainty regarding the environment of the Polish economy and the investment outlook.",
        "When analysing price developments in Poland, attention was drawn to ongoing deflation.",
        "However, Council members stressed that continued negative price growth was mainly due to external factors, including the earlier sharp fall in global commodity prices and low price growth in the environment of the Polish economy.",
        "Certain Council members were of the opinion that structural changes in retail trade, i.e.",
        "the growing market share of discount stores, might also limit consumer price growth.",
        "It was pointed out that currently there were no cost pressures in the economy.",
        "It was noted that PPI growth remained negative, although producer prices excluding energy-related goods were higher than a year before.",
        "The persistence of low PPI growth was supported by the still moderate wage growth, despite very good labour market conditions.",
        "In the opinion of certain Council members, the relatively large number of employees from Ukraine – probably earning relatively low wages – employed in the Polish labour market was a factor that curbed wage growth in the Polish economy.",
        "However, certain Council members pointed out that despite moderate wage growth, the share of wages in the operating costs of enterprises was rising.",
        "The majority of Council members judged that the persisting deflation had not adversely affected decisions of economic agents so far.",
        "Certain Council members pointed out that although inflation expectations of economic agents were running very low, households failed to notice the fall in the general level of consumer prices and were not postponing purchases.",
        "It was also underlined that the fall in prices had not led to a decrease in profitability of enterprises so far.",
        "However, certain Council members expressed the opinion that the continued deflation could be one of the factors behind the decline in corporate investment growth.",
        "These Council members judged that given falling prices, there was growing uncertainty about the future profitability of sales, which curbed firms’ propensity to embark on investment projects.",
        "Council members believed that it was necessary to continue to monitor the impact of deflation on the financial standing and the decisions of economic agents, in particular enterprises.",
        "Referring to the outlook for price growth, Council members judged that in the coming quarters CPI growth would remain negative, while at the end of 2016 it should be positive, and in the monetary policy transmission horizon it would probably return close to the lower limit of deviations from the inflation target.",
        "It was indicated that, apart from the fading effects of the previous sharp falls in global commodity prices, the forecasted rise in wage growth and the increase in social benefits would boost price growth.",
        "Certain Council members underlined that a marked acceleration in wage growth in April could signal a certain wage pressure emerging in the economy.",
        "They also expressed the opinion that the pick-up in consumer growth and increase in its contribution to GDP growth could lead to a stronger reaction of prices to the changes in real economy and faster than expected growth in CPI.",
        "However, other Council members drew attention to the fact that the increase in wage growth in April could stem from the postponement of the payment of bonuses in the mining sector, and 2016 Q1 data for the whole economy did not indicate a rise in wage pressure.",
        "While analysing the credit market conditions, Council members pointed to stable growth in household and corporate loans.",
        "Some Council members indicated that despite the stabilisation of NBP interest rates, the interest on housing loans and corporate loans had risen slightly last month.",
        "In turn, the interest on deposits offered to these entities had decreased somewhat in previous months.",
        "Certain Council members stressed that this notwithstanding, the growth of corporate deposits remained relatively high, which – in the opinion of these Council members – could be related to the firms’ preference for the safe forms of investment amid heightened uncertainty.",
        "At the same time, the growth of household deposits had picked up.",
        "However, it was underlined that this was accompanied by a slower rise in the more risky forms of investment and – altogether – a slowdown in growth of total household assets.",
        "While discussing the level of NBP interest rates, Council members decided that they should remain unchanged.",
        "Negative price growth was mainly driven by external factors.",
        "At the same time, deflation had no adverse effects on the decisions of economic agents.",
        "Moreover, negative price growth continued to be accompanied by relatively good economic conditions and a gradual improvement in labour market situation.",
        "Council members confirmed their assessment that against this background the stabilisation of interest rates helped to keep the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintain macroeconomic stability.",
        "Council members judged that the increased uncertainty regarding the domestic and external developments also spoke in favour of a stabilisation of interest rates.",
        "In addition, Council members argued that a stabilisation of interest rates ensured room for their adjustment in the case of shocks adversely affecting domestic economic situation and price developments.",
        "Some Council members did not rule out the possibility of interest rate cuts in the case of an economic slowdown in Poland, deepening deflation or signs of its negative impact on the behaviour of economic agents.",
        "Certain Council members pointed out that interest rate cut would be conducive to an increase in GDP growth, in particular by stimulating investment activity.",
        "However, other Council members judged that interest rate cut could have a limited impact on investment recovery, and any possible increase in investment could lead to launching projects with low expected profitability.",
        "Some Council members underlined that the decision of the Council should also take into account the impact of the level of interest rates on the stability of domestic financial sector.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 1.50%, the lombard rate at 2.50%, the deposit rate at 0.50%, the rediscount rate at 1.75%.",
        "At the meeting, the members of the Monetary Policy Council discussed monetary policy against the background of macroeconomic developments in Poland and abroad.",
        "While discussing the economic conditions in the environment of the Polish economy, Council members recognised that global economic activity remained moderate, amid continuing uncertainty about its outlook.",
        "It was highlighted that forecasts for global growth had been revised down by some international institutions.",
        "Attention was drawn to a renewed slowdown in GDP growth in the United States in 2016 Q1, which was assessed as an important factor that could have both direct and indirect impact on economic activity globally and in Poland.",
        "It was stressed, though, that GDP growth in the euro area, Poland's main trading partner, had remained stable.",
        "This notwithstanding, downside risks to growth in the euro area were mentioned.",
        "It was noted that household sentiment had recently deteriorated and exports of the euro area fell in early 2016 due to weaker economic conditions in emerging market economies, most notably China.",
        "These factors were assessed as downside risks to growth in the euro area.",
        "It was underlined that GDP growth forecasts for China – in spite of their recent minor upward revisions – were still pointing to continued gradual economic slowdown in this country in the coming years.",
        "While discussing price developments abroad, it was pointed out that price growth was still weak in many countries, and in some economies, including in the euro area, it was negative.",
        "It was stressed that this was mainly due to global commodity prices, which remained low despite some pick-up in recent months, as well as the moderate growth of global economic activity.",
        "It was also indicated that inflation forecasts in many countries had been revised down in the recent period.",
        "When discussing the economic conditions in Poland, attention was drawn to a revision of national accounts data for 2014-2015, which pointed to higher than previously estimated GDP growth in 2015 Q4.",
        "However, it was emphasised that the economic growth estimates for the previous quarters had been revised down, and that GDP growth in the whole of 2015 had remained unchanged.",
        "It was judged that in 2016 Q1 GDP growth had probably declined.",
        "It was argued that in March 2016 industrial production and retail sales growth had both decelerated markedly, and the fall in construction output had deepened.",
        "Certain Council members noted, however, that these indicators could have been affected by calendar factors.",
        "It was also highlighted that sentiment in the industrial sector, also relating to new export orders, was deteriorating, which could indicate the persistence of low industrial production growth in Poland in the following months.",
        "Council members judged that the economic slowdown in early 2016 was probably temporary.",
        "In next quarters, GDP growth should pick up slightly, although – as some Council members emphasised – given only moderate economic growth abroad the space for strong GDP growth is limited.",
        "In the coming quarters, GDP growth in Poland should be driven mainly by increasing consumption growth, supported by ongoing recovery in the labour market, further improvement in household sentiment, stable growth in consumer loans and an increase in family benefits resulting from a launch of the \"Family 500+\" programme.",
        "Growing corporate investment will probably also contribute to higher GDP growth, as it would be supported by sound financial standing of enterprises, their high capacity utilization and growing investment loans.",
        "It was noted, however, that the pace of absorption of funds from the new EU financial perspective was a factor of uncertainty for investment growth.",
        "While discussing price developments in Poland, attention was drawn to ongoing deflation, which resulted to a large extent from the earlier sharp fall in global commodity prices, amid low price growth in the environment of the Polish economy and continued negative output gap.",
        "It was noted that low energy prices stemming from the earlier fall in commodity prices reduced the prices of other goods and services, translating into negative core inflation indicators.",
        "It was pointed out that currently there were no cost pressures in the economy.",
        "It was highlighted that wage growth remained moderate in spite of improving labour market conditions and PPI growth had been negative for four years.",
        "However, some Council members noted that PPI growth excluding energy-related goods was higher than growth in total PPI and close to zero.",
        "Council members judged that although price growth in Poland had been negative for a long time, it had not adversely affected the decisions of economic agents so far.",
        "In particular, available data do not indicate the postponement of purchases by households or a reduction in corporate investment resulting from low price growth.",
        "However, some Council members expressed an opinion that currently observed investment growth was relatively low, given the high capacity utilisation and the expected improvement in economic conditions in Poland.",
        "This could suggest that deflation might reduce expected profitability of companies.",
        "Council members concluded that the impact of deflation on the financial standing and the behaviour of economic agents, in particular enterprises, should be still closely monitored.",
        "Referring to the outlook for consumer price growth, Council members assessed that it would remain negative in the coming quarters, mainly due to the continued fall in energy prices.",
        "However, as this factor abates, consumer price growth should gradually increase, supported by ongoing stable economic growth and improving labour market conditions.",
        "Some Council members also argued that persistently limited wage growth, despite falling unemployment, was an additional downside risk to price growth in Poland.",
        "Another downside risk to price growth named by some Council members was a possible deterioration in the economic conditions abroad, which could adversely affect domestic economic growth and domestic demand pressure.",
        "In the opinion of certain Council members, a significant increase in global commodity prices could not be ruled out in the coming quarters, which could lead to a notable increase in inflation in Poland, even if accompanied with a decline in economic growth.",
        "While discussing the level of NBP interest rates, Council members decided that they should remain unchanged at the current meeting.",
        "Council members stressed that the continued negative price growth was mainly caused by external factors and deflation had no adverse effects on the decisions of economic agents.",
        "Council members confirmed their assessment that the stabilisation of interest rates helped to keep the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintain macroeconomic balance.",
        "In addition, some Council members pointed out the need to take into account the impact of the level of interest rates on financial stability, drawing attention to heightened volatility in domestic financial markets.",
        "Certain Council members also expressed an opinion that fiscal loosening in 2016 was another significant factor which should be taken into account in the decisions on interest rates.",
        "Council members judged that the increased uncertainty regarding the domestic and external developments also spoke in favour of a stabilisation of interest rates.",
        "In this context, attention was drawn to concerns about a global slowdown and the risk of financial turmoil caused, among others, by the possible decision of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union.",
        "Council members also argued that a stabilisation of interest rates ensured room for their adjustment in the case of shocks adversely affecting domestic economic situation and price developments.",
        "Some Council members did not rule out the possibility of interest rate cuts in the case of an economic slowdown in Poland, deepening deflation or signs that behaviour of economic agents was adversely affected by negative price growth.",
        "Certain Council members argued that interest rate cuts would stimulate economic growth in Poland, including investment expenditure.",
        "At the same time, other Council members were of the opinion that given heightened uncertainty, the impact of lower interest rates on investment growth might be limited.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 1.50%, the lombard rate at 2.50%, the deposit rate at 0.50%, the rediscount rate at 1.75%.",
        "At the meeting, members of the Monetary Policy Council discussed monetary policy against the background of current and future macroeconomic developments in Poland and abroad.",
        "When discussing the economic situation abroad, Council members pointed to the sustained recovery in the euro area and in the United States.",
        "At the same time, it was noted that euro area economic activity growth remained moderate, and price growth in this currency area was still close to zero.",
        "It was observed that economic conditions in the United States continued to be favourable, although GDP growth would probably rise only slightly this year.",
        "At the same time it was emphasised that given the steady output growth in this economy since 2010, core inflation was markedly higher than consumer price growth, and the unemployment rate was running relatively low.",
        "Council members highlighted, that under these circumstances, monetary policy stances of the ECB and the Federal Reserve diverged further.",
        "The Federal Reserve had raised policy interest rates after keeping them close to zero for seven years.",
        "In this context, some Council members expressed the opinion that any further tightening of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve would be only gradual and contingent upon the incoming information on the economic conditions.",
        "In contrast, the ECB had eased the monetary policy again by extending the period for its asset purchases and decreasing the deposit rate.",
        "However, the extent of the easing was smaller than expected by the financial markets.",
        "While discussing economic conditions in emerging economies, Council members judged that these continued to be weak.",
        "Council members pointed to the continued recession and the persistently high inflation in Russia and Brazil.",
        "It was assessed that economic conditions in these countries were likely to deteriorate even further.",
        "While discussing the situation in China, Council members stressed that the recently released data had not been conclusive: while some of it had indicated stabilisation of economic activity growth, there had also been signs of an even deeper slump.",
        "Certain Council members held the view that economic growth in China might decelerate further, and high debt levels of economic agents in this country posed a risk of a sharp weakening of growth.",
        "Other Council members pointed out that China's economic policy would continue to aim for maintaining the stability of economic growth and financial system, which should mitigate the impact of any further weakening of the Chinese economy.",
        "Council members assessed that the economic outlook for China continued to be the main source of uncertainty for the global economy.",
        "The Council also pointed to developments in commodity prices, including oil prices, as another major source of uncertainty about the global economic outlook.",
        "It was stressed that in the recent period the price of this commodity had plunged to a very low level, which would dampen global consumer price growth in the subsequent quarters.",
        "At the same time, it was underlined that amidst the mounting conflict between two major oil producers, i.e.",
        "Saudi Arabia and Iran, heightened uncertainty prevailed as to the expected output level, and hence also future prices of this commodity.",
        "Council members emphasised the fact that sharp declines in oil prices, changes in the expectations about the future decisions of major central banks and continued concerns about economic activity in China had recently boosted asset price volatility in the financial markets.",
        "It was observed that some of these factors had increased investors risk aversion.",
        "This was reflected in declining asset prices and weakening currencies of emerging economies, including Poland.",
        "While discussing the situation in Poland's real economy, Council members pointed to the continued stable economic activity growth.",
        "Retail sales data were judged to indicate sustained consumer demand expansion, at a rate close to that observed in the previous quarters.",
        "Consumption growth continues to be supported by rising employment and robust consumer sentiment.",
        "With regard to investment, it was observed that its growth was being fuelled by the high degree of capacity utilisation in companies amidst stable industrial output growth.",
        "At the same time, it was pointed out that firms' propensity to invest may be undermined by heightened uncertainty about the domestic and external environment of their activity.",
        "Certain Council members believed that consumption and investment growth remained merely moderate.",
        "Council members pointed out that GDP growth in the following quarters would be supported by further decline in oil prices.",
        "At the same time, it was underlined that lower prices of this commodity would have an adverse impact on some businesses, especially mining sector companies and firms whose production was aimed at oil net exporting countries.",
        "With reference to the situation in the labour market, sustained employment growth and declining unemployment were highlighted.",
        "Certain Council members observed that improving labour market conditions had not yet generated any tangible increase in nominal wage growth in the economy.",
        "At the same time, wage growth had recently accelerated somewhat in the corporate sector, and the share of firms planning pay rises had increased, which may signal a gradual rise in wage pressure in the economy, which if it materialised - would support the return of consumer price growth towards the inflation target.",
        "Council members discussed fiscal policy in the context of the 2016 Draft Budget Act.",
        "Most members judged that the fiscal policy as set out in the Draft Budget Act did not entail an increase in public finance imbalance in 2016.",
        "At the same time, members deemed that due to lags in monetary policy transmission, the shape of the 2017 fiscal policy was of key importance for the current interest rates decisions.",
        "In this context, it was pointed out that one-off revenues will make an important source of financing of the new budget expenditure in 2016.",
        "Thus, in order to keep the deficit at a moderate level in 2017, new, stable sources of budget revenue would have to be found.",
        "Some Council members assessed that the increased spending on social benefits – including the introduction of the Family 500+ programme – might stimulate consumption growth.",
        "Referring to the impact of the imposition of tax on financial institutions, these members expressed the view that it could lead to an increase in cost of obtaining credit and a slowdown in lending.",
        "With reference to the sales tax to be imposed on stores, Council members stated that in the absence of detailed information on this tax, it was difficult to evaluate its consequences; however, it could possibly add to price growth.",
        "Certain Council members expressed the opinion that the changes in fiscal policy may diminish the resilience of the Polish economy to external shocks, thus narrowing down the margin for a possible monetary policy easing.",
        "When analysing the situation in the credit market, Council members pointed out that stable, moderate credit growth had been sustained.",
        "At the same time, some Council members underlined that lending growth in the following quarters might be hampered, on the one hand, by the lowering of the ceiling on the LtV ratio for mortgage loans, resulting from Recommendation S, and, on the other hand, by a possible rise in the borrowing cost after the imposition of the bank tax.",
        "While discussing inflation developments in Poland, members of the Council indicated that the scale of consumer price deflation in December declined only slightly.",
        "Council members assessed that in the coming quarters CPI would continue to rise slowly, yet, due to a further fall in commodity prices, growth of consumer goods and services prices was likely to be significantly lower than previously estimated.",
        "It was pointed out that price growth would be supported by the closing of the output gap, amidst the recovery in the euro area and the robust domestic labour market.",
        "Council members also pointed out that the continued deflation did not yet have any adverse effect on decisions of economic agents.",
        "Some Council members expressed the opinion that it was necessary to closely monitor the impact of negative price growth on decisions of economic agents, in particular on financial situation of enterprises.",
        "While discussing interest rates, the Council decided that they should be kept unchanged.",
        "It was assessed that the available data and forecasts suggested that the current level of interest rates helped to keep the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and to maintain macroeconomic stability.",
        "It was argued that in the coming quarters price growth would slowly pick up.",
        "It was also noted that the likely slowdown in CPI growth as compared to the previous expectations was driven by declining oil prices in the global commodity markets, a factor beyond the influence of the domestic monetary policy.",
        "It was further noted that given the lags in the transmission mechanism of monetary policy, current decisions on interest rates would not affect price growth until the negative impact of declining energy commodity prices on inflation had already diminished.",
        "However, in the medium term CPI growth would be supported by steady growth in domestic economic activity.",
        "At the same time the rise in price growth may be driven up by the imposition of the sales tax on stores.",
        "Some members of the Council emphasized that one of the arguments in favour of stabilization of interest rates was the continued uncertainty about the external and domestic determinants of monetary policy.",
        "It was also pointed out that this uncertainty was reflected in movements of the prices of Polish assets and the zloty.",
        "Certain Council members were of the opinion that in these conditions the decisions on interest rates should take into account their impact on the financial markets.",
        "Moreover, some Council members assessed that when deciding about the level of interest rates they should factor in their impact on the financial sector stability.",
        "In this context, those members pointed out that interest rate cuts could have a negative impact on the performance of the banking sector, a factor which could not be downplayed given the increased financial burden imposed on the sector.",
        "Certain members of the Council were of the opinion that in the coming months it might be justified to consider interest rate hikes.",
        "They argued that this would leave more room for monetary policy response to severe external shocks.",
        "In contrast, other Council members were of the opinion that it might be justified to cut the interest rates in the coming months.",
        "Those members pointed to a merely modest – in their opinion – growth in domestic demand and a relatively high level of real interest rates, as well as forecasted low price growth.",
        "The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 1.50%, the lombard rate at 2.50%, the deposit rate at 0.50% and the rediscount rate at 1.75%."
