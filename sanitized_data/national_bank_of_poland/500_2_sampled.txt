Some Council members also drew attention to intensifying wage pressure indicated by companies, which, along with an increase in the minimum wage in 2017, might boost nominal wage growth
The Council also discussed the future path of NBP interest rates
With reference to future monetary policy decisions, on the other hand, most members of the Council were of the opinion that should the relatively fast domestic growth, elevated inflation and high inflation expectations continue, the increase in NBP interest rates cannot be ruled out
The majority of the Council members assessed that an argument for keeping the interest rates unchanged was in particular the gradual increase in price growth
In their opinion, the pace of the domestic economic recovery would also be dependent upon further developments of the zloty exchange rate
In turn, in the opinion of certain Council members, heightened inflation might increase wage demands of various occupational groups, translating into growing wage pressures in the coming quarters
While discussing the interest rate decision, most members of the Council believed that at the current meeting interest rates should remain unchanged
At the same time, some members of the Council argued that with the economic growth strengthening further in Poland the risk of rising wage pressure is increased by a  Warszawa ul Świętokrzy ska  22  51 relatively high and still growing level of wage expectations of the unemployed, adversely affecting their readiness to take up employment
In the opinion of the Council, the main source of uncertainty as regards the scale and pace of recovery continued to be the further course of the pandemic and its impact on economic conditions at home and abroad
It was emphasised that the fall in inflation had been supported by the decline in energy commodity prices and the easing of global supply chain tensions, as well as the weakening of demand
In particular, it was noted that in November HICP inflation in the euro area reached 4.9, the highest level in the history of this currency area, and in the United States CPI inflation in November stood at 6.8, the highest level in about 40 years
While assessing the outlook for economic growth in Poland, it was pointed out that the growth of industrial output and retail sales in March was lower than in the previous two months and significantly below expectations
In the recent period, growth of producer prices also came to a halt
In the opinion of those Council members lower responsiveness of the exchange rate to changes in the disparity is a factor speaking in favour of tightening monetary policy in Poland as soon as possible
In the context of price developments in the external environment of the Polish economy, attention was drawn to the rise in global oil prices in recent months
While addressing the issue of the exchange rate, some Council members argued that despite the recently observed appreciation of the zloty, it should be treated neutrally in taking monetary policy decisions due to the possible considerable fluctuations of the exchange rate
The Council members also noted that prices of many nonenergy commodities, particularly agricultural commodities, had continued to fall
These members also highlighted that several external institutions had revised their forecasts for economic growth in Poland downwards and that the uncertainty related to global economic conditions continued
At the same time, as the effects of those shocks waned, price growth would gradually increase
While discussing NBPs monetary policy, the Council assessed that the risk of persistently running above the target in the medium term was low
Referring to monetary policy in the external environment of the Polish economy, it was noted that the ECB was keeping the deposit rate below zero
Some Council members were of the opinion that price growth in the years to come might be higher than currently forecast
It was pointed out that the Federal Reserve continued to reduce its balance sheet, while signalling further interest rate increases in the future
In this context, these members emphasised particularly the adverse impact of the steep rise in public expenditure following the financial crisis on the private sectors propensity to invest and to consume
They also pointed out that due to the relatively slow adjustment of employment in the first stage of the economic slowdown, employment growth, and consequently also the growth of unit labour costs, might in the longer term be lower than accounted for in the projection
It was observed that in September inflation was on the rise in the majority of Central and Eastern European countries as well
It was pointed out that employment in enterprises had fallen slightly again in April, although the number of job offers had increased compared to March
When analysing inflation developments in Poland, it was stressed that annual growth in consumer prices had stabilised at a moderate level following a significant rise at the beginning of 2017
It was emphasised that in other countries in the immediate environment of the Polish economy, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe, interest rates also remained close to zero
As a result  as it was emphasised  inflation in the euro area would probably remain below the ECBs inflation target also in the coming years
The rise occurred despite the EBCs public sector purchase programme
Some Council members pointed to a slight improvement in lending growth, supported by low loan costs
Certain Council members pointed out that monthly wage growth in the enterprise sector also remained relatively high
Some Council members assessed that the decline in Chinas economic growth could translate  through its adverse impact on the outlook for German exports  into a slowdown in the Polish exports
Some Council members were of the opinion that those developments increased the risk that consumer demand, which had been the main driver of economic growth in Germany up to that point, would weaken in the subsequent quarters
The consistently low level of inflation expectations of economic agents were also highlighted
However, weaker March industrial orders and business sentiment in Germany were brought to attention
While analysing commodity price developments, it was pointed out that oil prices were higher than in previous quarters, yet signs of their stabilisation had appeared in recent weeks
It would be also conducive to anchoring the inflation expectations at the level of the NBPs inflation target
While discussing NBPs monetary policy, the Council decided that the interest rates should be left unchanged at the current meeting
It was observed also that the interest rates were low in Central and Eastern European economies
A few members of the Council argued that the zloty had weakened partially on the back of the slump of the rouble
The majority of Council members pointed out that due to the possibility of a stronger economic slowdown in China and renewed fall in commodity prices, uncertainty regarding economic activity and price developments in Poland had increased and the balance of risks for economic growth and inflation had shifted downwards
It was noted that industrial output in the euro area was declining and business confidence indicators for the industrial sector  despite some improvement seen in November  still did not signal a recovery
The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged at the following levels reference rate at 4.5, lombard rate at 6.00, deposit rate at 3.00, rediscount rate at 4.75
It was also emphasised that inflation developments, both in the short- and medium-term, were associated with uncertainty, related in particular to the pace of economic recovery in Poland and its impact on price developments as well as future course of fiscal and regulatory policies
The Council members drew attention to the results of business climate surveys, which suggested an easing of cost pressures as a result of mitigated supply chains disruptions and a decline in international transport costs
from a strong increase in commodity prices in the world markets associated with rising demand from the emerging economies
The reduction in debt servicing costs would therefore mitigate the losses of enterprises and households caused by production stoppages, lower incomes and lower demand for goods and services
Other members of the Council emphasised, however, that M3 growth was not low when compared to the growth of nominal GDP
Nevertheless, monetary tightening might prove justified in the nearest future, unless signs of considerable economic weakening in Poland appear and the outlook for inflation returning to the target improves
The Council members also underlined that the scale and timing of the recovery would depend, above all, on the epidemic situation and the related restrictions
On the one hand, reduction of budget deficits, although likely to support economic growth in the longer run, could lead to another decline in activity in those economies in the short run
While addressing the situation in the labour market, it was pointed out that the wage and employment growth in the enterprise sector in March was still high, which was conducive to increasing the demand pressure
While discussing price developments abroad, it was emphasised that commodity price growth had recently come to a halt
While analysing the inflationary developments, some members of the Council emphasized that decline in January inflation was more pronounced than had been forecast, and in the absence of zloty depreciation, inflation might be expected to decrease further by the end of the year
In the opinion of those members of the Council it could also be expected that the forecast inflation decrease below the target in 2010 may prove short-lived
The Council members underlined a considerable contribution from change in inventories to GDP growth in 2018 Q1
Other Council members observed, however, that the increase in inflation at the beginning of 2020  should it occur  would be short-lived, and later in 2020 inflation would probably run close to the target
The Council members pointed out that given the considerable growth in both current and expected inflation, many central banks were withdrawing monetary accommodation, although the monetary authorities decisions were not homogenous and reflected the country-specific conditions for the conduct of monetary policy
With reference to the situation in the labour market, sustained employment growth and declining unemployment were highlighted
Those members also pointed out that the heightened inflation was also observed in many other countries and stressed that in Poland its level was lower than in other Central and Eastern European countries
This was supported by a fall in the prices of some commodities, including gas prices in Europe, and oil and agricultural commodities in global markets, as well as the gradual easing of the supply chain disruptions and a decline in freight prices
Certain Council members indicated in turn that in the coming quarters it might be justified to consider the circumstances under which the monetary policy stance could be reexamined
It was also indicated that import growth might be connected not only with exchange rate appreciation but also with a strong growth of domestic demand
At the same time, they pointed to a significant uncertainty about the economic growth outlook for China
In addition, it was noted that economic consequences of deflation would depend on its level, sources and duration
It was observed that the rise in global infections had contributed to a slump in confidence in international financial markets, which was reflected, among others, in a weakening of emerging market currencies
In addition, they pointed out that corporate lending growth remained slow, which  in the opinion of certain Council members  might result from companies financing operations from sources other than bank credit
Discussing economic conditions in Poland, the Council members judged that, despite external risks, they remained favourable, supported by good labour market conditions, improved financial standing of enterprises, high capacity utilization, stable lending growth, as well as high price competitiveness of the Polish economy combined with ongoing economic recovery in Polands main trading partners
At the same time, some Council members listed the following factors likely to pose risk for sustainable recovery in the American economy weakening of upward trends in the real estate market, further curbing of bank lending to the private sector and persistently high budget deficit
However, some Council members underlined that some indicators of economic conditions, particularly in Germany  Polands main trading partner, had deteriorated recently
However, certain Council members were of the opinion that the negative impact of the downturn abroad on inflation in Poland might be limited when accompanied by increased domestic sales
It was underlined that as a result, uncertainty about the global economic outlook for the coming quarters had risen in recent months
Yet, some members of the Council pointed out that the impact of the exchange rate weakening on prices amidst economic slowdown would probably be limited
Other members, however, assessed that the spending of the public finance sector as a whole had increased significantly in 2007 and their structure had become more rigid
It was pointed out that should the reference rate be lowered, the current width of the corridor would be very large in relation to the basic interest rate level
In the opinion of these Council members, developments in inflation expectations would also be important for monetary policy
Council members also pointed to the likelihood of forthcoming interest rate rise in the United States, which would probably support an inflow of portfolio capital to the US economy
Nevertheless, according to available forecasts, in 2023 GDP growth in major economies would be relatively weak
In the opinion of few Council members, wage pressures were additionally mitigated with a wage freeze in the public sector
Some Council members pointed out that a very fast credit growth may contribute to further growth in domestic demand and accumulation of inflationary pressure, among others, in the asset market
A motion to raise the key NBP interest rates by 25 basis points was put forward
Some members quoted the examples of some EU countries which experienced wage growths exceeding the growth of labour productivity amid a stable nominal exchange rate, which -2 led to a strong appreciation of the real effective exchange rate of their currencies and the loss of competitiveness of these countries
While assessing credit market conditions, Council members noted that the corporate lending was still low
They highlighted, in particular, the increasing availability of corporate credit, evidenced by the rising percentage of loan applications being approved
At the same time, it was pointed out that according to current forecasts, the annual price growth would increase in the coming months, however  due to the lower oil prices than in 2018 Q3 and the freeze on electricity prices  the scale of this increase would be significantly smaller than that expected in the November projection
Certain Council members judged that, against this background, oil prices would probably remain relatively high in the coming months, albeit slightly below their current level
In the opinion of some Council members, towards the end of 2012, CPI inflation will run below the upper limit for deviations from the target
At the same time, in China and in other emerging economies, where growth has slowed down to a low level considering their past performance, there is persisting uncertainty about future developments in GDP
At the same time, it was emphasised that core inflation was low, while growth in producer prices had declined somewhat
In the medium term, the lowering of inflationary pressure will be driven by stronger than previously expected decline in the global and domestic economic growth, low inflation in the external environment of the Polish economy translating into declining growth in the prices of import goods and faster than anticipated in the projection weakening of wage pressure connected with falling labour demand and increased labour supply, inter alia, as a result of intensified return of Poles from the economic migration
At the same time, it was pointed out that developments in the financial markets would be an important factor that may affect the prospects of Polands adoption of the euro
Certain Council members drew attention to the fact that economic activity was supported by the sustained good situation in foreign trade, reflected in a large surplus in the trade in goods account of the balance of payments
Factors pointing to such a scenario include the rising production capacity utilisation and enterprises good financial results, enabling them to self-finance investment projects as well as facilitating access to external financing
Other Council members pointed out that the monetary tightening in the United States was accompanied by a marked easing of fiscal policy in this country
However, certain Council members were of the opinion that the NBP reference rate should be raised at the current meeting
However, the data on its structure indicated that the rise in inventories had a large contribution to GDP growth, whereas consumption and investment growth had declined
When discussing monetary policy in Polands external environment, it was pointed out that the main central banks were keeping interest rates close to zero
A marked decline in industrial output in December 2009 and a low GDP growth in the euro area in 2009 Q4, including the stagnation in Germany, was stressed
Moreover, in the assessment of those Council members, the shifting of some central budget expenditures to other general government units, which was assumed in the discussed bill, led to reducing the transparency of the public finance and increasing the uncertainty as to the actual scale of fiscal imbalance in Poland
It was indicated that globally rising inflation made some central banks withdraw monetary accommodation, although, it was stressed that monetary policy decisions of monetary authorities were being adjusted to conditions prevailing in particular economies, which meant that certain central banks were continuing to conduct expansive monetary policy
It was also noted that capacity utilization in the economy had grown in 2013 Q1, and that  in line with available forecasts  GDP growth should not decrease further and it is expected to accelerate gradually over coming quarters
At the same time it was pointed out that in September inflation expectations of bank analysts and some measures of inflation expectations of individuals decreased; in the opinion of some members of the Council, the decline in the economic activity in Poland, as anticipated by households, might contribute to the lowering of households expectations of future inflation
Most members of the Council emphasised that a possible future decision to raise the NBP interest rates would be justified if the economic activity were to decelerate only slightly and inflation were not be in a clear downward trend
Some Council members indicated that the currently observed strongly growing demand in the product market, amid a limited growth in domestic supply, will lead to increased inflation
This risk, according to members of the Council, is also limited by the already implemented substantial tightening of the monetary policy of the NBP
The recent slight decline in inflation expectations of households and enterprises was also highlighted
At the meeting, it was indicated that  according to the Statistics Poland flash estimate  in May 2024 CPI inflation stood at 2.5 yy
The continued uncertainty about the global outlook, commodity prices and price growth in the environment of the Polish economy were emphasised
The outlook for oil prices was, however, judged as highly uncertain, particularly if the pre-agreement on oil production cuts had not become effective at the forthcoming summit of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries OPEC
At the same time, it was pointed out that the pace and scale of the recovery were subject to considerable uncertainty
While analysing inflation expectations, it was remarked that the structure of responses to questions in the surveys of both companies and households had not changed markedly of late
by the positive base effect connected with a sharp fall in fuel prices in the second half of 2008
Considering these circumstances  and taking into account the time lags in the monetary policy transmission to the economy  the Council adjusted the NBP interest rates, which is consistent with meeting the NBP inflation target in the medium term
While addressing economic developments in Poland, it was pointed out that the data released in May, particularly concerning the GDP in 2012 Q1 and its composition, confirmed the gradual weakening in the Polish economic activity
Certain Council members judged that amid the fading of external shocks boosting price growth, domestic factors started to play a more important role in inflation developments in Poland
While discussing developments in Polands real economy, the Council members pointed to flash GDP estimate which had indicated a considerable rise in the economic growth rate in 2017 Q1
Available data also signal a recovery in investment, although  as emphasised at the meeting  mainly in public investment
In the Councils assessment, these arguments justified monetary policy tightening at the current meeting
During the discussion at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council it was noted that economic conditions in the euro area remained weakened, although some of the indicators signalled that the coming quarters might see a slow recovery in activity
The Council paid significant attention to the public finance situation in Poland
A motion to raise the NBP interest rates by 25 basis points was put forward at the meeting
Proceeding to discuss the information from the Polish economy, the Council started by assessing the economic situation in Poland in 2019
Further arguments in favour of this decision included the persistently high unemployment rate and modest wage pressures in the enterprise sector, both reducing the risk that heightened inflation, which up to now has resulted from factors beyond the direct influence of monetary policy, should persist
It was judged that growth in employment and wages in the euro area, as well as rising industrial output and some improvement in economic indicators, signalled further moderate growth in the coming quarters
As a result, annual CPI growth is expected to run at the level consistent with the NBP inflation target in the coming months, while core inflation will remain above CPI inflation
In effect, wage bill growth was also higher, yet, as some Council members stressed, it did not exceed industrial output growth
the most likely outcome, the annual GDP growth would start to slightly accelerate in 2015 Q2
While discussing the level of the NBP interest rates, the Council judged that they should remain unchanged
The major central banks  including the ECB and the Fed  continue their highly accommodative monetary policy and emphasise in their communications the considerable uncertainty about the prospects for the economy and the temporary nature of the factors boosting inflation in 2021
At the same time, while addressing future decisions, some Council members were of the opinion that another interest rate cut in the coming months might be justified should there be no clear signs of rebound in the Polish economy, and should the likelihood of inflation persisting below the NBP target in the medium term rise
In addition, the Council members pointed out that net exports, supported by a gradual recovery in the euro area, contributed positively to the GDP growth rate in 2015 Q1
The Council members underlined that in line with earlier forecasts, inflation in Poland was decreasing
Falling unit labour costs in member states most severely affected by the debt crisis is also a factor lowering inflation in the euro area
Some Council members who were in favour of keeping interest rates unchanged at the current meeting emphasized that they did not rule out the possibility of a further adjustment of interest rates
Most Council members pointed out that given the persistence of inflation and the risks related to price growth within the horizon of the strongest monetary policy impact, the reduction in the NBP interest rates should not be significant
The majority of Council members underlined that the annual CPI inflation rate continued to be boosted by rapid growth in fuel prices  due to significantly higher global oil prices than a year earlier  the increase in electricity prices, which took place at the beginning of 2021, and the increase in waste disposal charges, and thus by factors which were beyond the control of domestic monetary policy
However, some Council members noted that PPI growth excluding energy-related goods was higher than growth in total PPI and close to zero
In turn, the strengthening private consumption amid further high export growth could translate into investment recovery in enterprises, even though due to the uncertainty surrounding the future economic situation, including the situation in the public finance sector, corporate investment growth in the quarters to come could remain low
Members of the Council emphasized, however, that considering the prospects for growing demand for commodities amidst limited supply growth, the observed slowdown in price growth might be temporary
The Council set the NBP interest rates as follows the reference rate at 0.50, the lombard rate at 1.00, the deposit rate at 0.00, the rediscount rate at 0.55, and the discount rate at 0.60
While addressing the measures implemented by other central banks, those Council members argued that Poland was in a better economic situation as compared to countries, which were introducing unconventional monetary policy measures
They claimed that at present it was difficult to assess the impact of the governments planned changes in public expenditure and revenue on economic activity and inflation in Poland
They underlined that price growth might be boosted by further growth in services prices, including prices of administered services
While discussing the interest rate decision, some Council members assessed that the monetary policy adjustment should be continued at the November meeting
A motion to lower the NBP interest rates by 50 basis points and a motion to lower the NBP interest rates by 75 basis points were put forward
Few Council members also pointed to the risk of a slowdown in growth at the end of 2015 and at the beginning of 2016
While discussing the level of interest rates in the Polish economy some Council members indicated that the risk of inflation running above the NBP inflation target in the medium term, which increases along with the gradual acceleration of economic growth, justified starting the cycle of gradual tightening of the monetary policy at the current meeting
In the opinion of other members of the Council, considerable economic slowdown abroad, signs of economic slowdown in Poland, the already implemented interest rate increases and the expected decline in wage pressure would constitute factors bringing inflation down to the target in the medium term
Regarding monetary policy abroad, it was highlighted that the Federal Reserve had started reducing its balance sheet in October, and that in December it would probably raise its interest rates
At the meeting it was noted that the heightened geopolitical tensions in the Middle East were a risk factor for the global economy
Council members discussed the level of interest rates and the impact of monetary policy tightening on economic growth
Moreover, those members pointed to a deteriorating growth outlook in the European economy, particularly in Germany which so far had reported relatively high economic growth
Some members of the Council assessed that a significant zloty depreciation may limit the foreign investors willingness to finance the borrowing needs of the state budget
The majority of the Council members emphasized that no cost pressure had been seen in the economy, as evidenced by the negative growth in producer prices and persistently low wage growth
Moreover, some Council members pointed out that the announced change in VAT rates would be mitigating household consumption growth in 2011
According to these members of the Council, the growing activity in the global economy would support acceleration of GDP growth in Poland and maintaining high growth of commodity prices in the world markets in the years to come  translating into a rise in domestic inflationary pressures
The majority of Council members emphasised that the pace of economic recovery might also be curbed by the lack of significant adjustment of the zloty exchange rate to the global shock caused by the pandemic and NBPs monetary policy easing
At the same time, the recovery would be fraught with uncertainty, among others, due to the effects of monetary policy tightening by the European Central Bank and also due to structural problems in some of the large euro area economies
Certain Council members judged that the NBP interest rates should be kept unchanged at the current meeting
Other members of the Council pointed out that, despite the rapid growth of wages in enterprises, July brought a significant drop in the growth of unit labour costs in industry and so the deterioration in the relation between wages and productivity was not perpetuated in this sector
It was also emphasised that a potential deceleration in the global economy, including Western European economies, might lead to lower emigration of Polish workers, which would limit the wage pressure
While analysing the current monetary policy, some Council members assessed that the current level of interest rates might be adequate to maintain price stability over the medium term, particularly considering the economic slowdown
Some Council members also pointed to the reduced scale of decline in the prices of goods strongly affected by globalisation recorded in the recent months, which was partially connected with the earlier zloty exchange rate depreciation
When analysing the situation in the credit market, Council members pointed out that stable, moderate credit growth had been sustained
Moreover, those Council members pointed out that  despite a decline in June  the CPI inflation in the whole of 2009 Q2 proved markedly higher than in the June projection
Some Council members assessed, however, that taking into account a possible decline in the potential growth of the Polish economy as a result of the financial crisis and other factors, the current rate of economic growth was already relatively high and would not be a factor limiting the inflation rise in Poland
Certain Council members pointed to the announced easing of the supervisory recommendations on credit scoring terms for certain loans
Those members observed that the arguments in favour of a relatively prompt monetary policy easing include, in particular, the length of lags in the monetary policy transmission mechanism
They highlighted the relatively fast, in their opinion, rise in consumer loans and the resulting high level of household debt compared to other European countries
The Council members expressed an opinion that given the above mentioned factors which were likely to affect CPI inflation in 2024, core inflation developments were of significant importance for the assessment of domestic inflation processes
This should reduce the risk of excessive credit expansion and asset price rises, as well as of the increase of inflationary pressures
Together with the relatively low  despite some acceleration  economic activity growth it was conducive to a decline in inflation
While analyzing the situation in the real sphere of the Polish economy, some members expressed the opinion that GDP growth in 2015 Q2 might have continued close to the previous quarters level
Those members of the Council claimed that the NBP interest rate increase would be justified in order to reduce the risk of the emergence of such pressure
While discussing the decision on interest rates, the Council assessed that the considerable deterioration of the outlook for global economic growth, as well as the increased uncertainty as to the future economic activity in Poland coupled with elevated current and expected inflation, justified keeping the NBPs interest rates unchanged at the current meeting
While discussing domestic monetary policy, the Council members judged that the measures that NBP had taken so far had contributed to an easing of the monetary conditions
Since interest rate rises themselves would not eliminate the credit boom risk they should be complemented with appropriate supervisory measures
Certain Council members also argued that price growth might be boosted by constraints on the supply of commodities and raw materials amid a rise in demand for semi-products during the economic recovery
It was emphasized that those developments were beyond the control of domestic monetary policy and that a rise in inflation driven by accelerating growth of food and fuel prices was also observed in many other countries
They also indicated that the recently observed acceleration in CPI inflation was primarily the result of supply-side and statistical factors
In February CPI inflation had declined to 2.8, and in March, according to the Statistics Poland flash estimate, it had fallen to 1.9  therefore, within thirteen months since reaching its peak, inflation had fallen by over 16 p.p
It was judged that the disinflation process was also supported by the marked appreciation of the zloty observed in recent months
It was highlighted that GDP growth in China continued to slow down and underlined that it could decelerate further due to significant imbalances in China and limited scope to stimulate this economy
However, it was observed that despite this improvement in the economic conditions, annual GDP growth remained negative
In this context, attention was paid to considerable decline in the monetary policy restrictiveness, which was driven  apart from interest rate cuts  also by the previously observed significant weakening of the zloty exchange rate
Some members of the Council assessed that Poland is likely to cease fulfilling the Maastricht price stability criterion within a short time
If the turmoil recedes, this segment of the credit market may show a rapid expansion
Discussing inflation developments in Poland, it was observed that the annual consumer price growth had increased to 1.6 in April, in line with expectations
Those members also pointed to a decreasing wage pressure in the Polish economy
Council members observed that in the coming months, with price growth being boosted by the base effect in fuel prices and the current increase in global oil prices, inflation might pick up
A few Council members assessed that, also over the next few quarters, ULC growth should remain slow
In the opinion of some Council members, these data confirmed the continuation of strong activity in the Polish economy in 2008 Q1 suggesting, at the same time, that the global economic slowdown had thus far not deteriorated economic climate in Poland
At the Council meeting it was pointed out that the recovery in global economic activity was continuing, although in some economies it had probably slowed down somewhat in 2021 Q3
Those Council member argued that the reductions of the NBP interest rates decrease the banks incomes from servicing the previously granted loans, which  coupled with a relatively high interest rate on deposits  may induce banks to increase margins on newly granted loans
They argued that high growth of those prices in the analysed period resulted, on the one hand, from growing demand pressure which, in turn, in the opinion of those members of the Council, was the result of the high wage growth and fast credit growth observed in the past few quarters, and, on the other hand, from intensifying cost pressure driven by rising unit labour costs
It was noted that currently core inflation abroad, including the euro area, was low
However, some of the members pointed to risk factors underlying a prompt and sustained revival of the Polish economy
With reference to inflation in the remaining part of the year, members of the Council assessed that the said supply and administrative factors were likely to cause the annual inflation rate to remain above the upper limit of deviations from the inflation target in the coming months
It was also emphasised that in the United States, the GDP data for 2019 Q3 corroborated the persistently robust economic conditions as compared to other advanced economies, yet annual GDP growth was gradually decreasing
Some Council members pointed out that acceleration in GDP growth in the coming quarters should be driven by a recovery in domestic demand, especially investment, which would be supported by the inflow of EU funds under the new budget perspective
Those members assessed that the economic slowdown in emerging economies will have a smaller scale than in the United States and the euro area and that the weakening economic growth in Poland would not significantly reduce the labour market tensions
Other members of the Council pointed out, however, that import growth outstripping export growth could have been connected with high growth in domestic demand, hence, considering the expected economic slowdown in Poland, import growth should be expected to decline
Council members pointed out that faced with the collapse in economic activity in March and April, many countries had undertaken unprecedented fiscal measures aimed at reducing the scale of the decline in incomes of households and businesses, as well as stimulating economic activity
Moreover, it was pointed out that interest rate increases implemented earlier this year might also act towards slower economic growth, albeit with a lag
A few Council members were of the opinion that, given an acceleration in labour productivity growth as shown in the projection, wage growth should not run close to historical lows
At the meeting, it was pointed out that according to Statistics Poland preliminary data, annual CPI inflation had declined to 14.7 in April from 16.1 in March and 18.4 in February, which was primarily due to the slower annual food price growth
On the other hand, countries which fail to implement a consolidation of public finances or which continue to pursue expansionary fiscal policy, might see a decline in economic growth caused by the fiscal imbalances negative impact on private demand
It was assessed that  along with the expected growth in the use of EU funds  this should support gross fixed capital formation, while also stressing that under the July projection investment growth in 2017 Q2 was probably only slightly positive
It was pointed out that rising inflation expectations might add to wage pressure
Other Council members, however, were convinced that the recently observed appreciation of the zloty exchange rate limited the rise of inflation and that the inflation outlook would be affected by future developments in the foreign exchange market
It was highlighted that growth was still driven primarily by domestic demand, including consumer demand, supported by rising employment and wages, disbursement of benefits and very good consumer confidence
It was pointed out that in the current conditions the central banks of the major economies were keeping interest rates low and purchasing assets
At the same time, April saw a significant growth in retail sales which was, on the one hand, the result of the inflow of refugees and the pandemic-related base effects and, on the other hand, the result of the constantly rising household income
They also pointed out that a lowering of the demand for Polish exports, due to the significant deterioration of economic growth in countries which are Polands main trading partners, would be conducive to the decline in GDP growth
Those members assessed that while inflation was considerably affected by external factors, should domestic economic activity prove resilient to the slowdown in GDP growth abroad and, hence, should the easing of inflation pressure due to worsened economic conditions turn out smaller than currently expected, an increase of NBP interest rates could be justified
During the discussion on monetary policy abroad, it was pointed out that, despite the strengthening of the economic recovery in the euro area, the European Central Bank had revised downward its medium-term inflation forecasts for the euro area economy
It was emphasised that the higher than previously expected increase in the minimum wage which was announced by the government would be a factor conducive to higher wage growth
While referring to future decisions, the majority of the Council members did not rule out further monetary policy easing, should the incoming data, including the 2012 GDP data, confirm a protracted economic slowdown and should the risk of increase in inflationary pressure remain limited
During the discussion, the Council pointed out that weakening of external economic activity, in particular in Germany, translated into a pronounced deceleration in Polish exports growth
At the same time, some Council members pointed to a slowdown in both industrial production at the beginning of 2015 Q2 and sales in construction and assembly production in May 2015, as well as a merely moderate increase in retail sales
In turn, certain Council members judged that the economic recovery might proceed faster than assumed in the projection due to the positive impact on GDP of large infrastructure projects
Also retail sales in real terms slowed down, with sales of durable goods falling compared to the previous year
Similarly, producer price growth proved lower than forecast
During the discussion it was pointed out that in September 2024, the European Central Bank had cut interest rates once again
GDP growth had accelerated to 2.0 in 2024 Q1
They pointed to flagging external demand as the principal source of weaker economic growth
Other members of the Council emphasized, however, that in view of the fast deteriorating outlook for domestic economic growth, it was necessary to lower, as soon as possible, the interest rates to the level supporting the economic activity in Poland
During the discussion, attention was drawn to the gradually increasing annual growth in the value of bank loans, both to households and enterprises
Amid the weakened global economic conditions, activity growth has also declined in Poland
It was underlined that growth in both prices of services and non-food products had most likely declined
leading to persistently relatively high inflation
Certain Council members assessed that GDP growth this year could be slightly lower than projected
A majority of the Council members expected GDP growth to turn out slightly higher than in the July projection
It was pointed out at the meeting that in May 2022 inflation in Poland had risen to 13.9 yy
The Council members drew attention to the fact that the unemployment rate in Poland remained at a historically low level
During the meeting, the Council noted that incoming data pointed to weaker economic conditions in some of the largest economies, and assessed that uncertainty about the outlook for global activity in the coming quarters had increased
Some members of the Council emphasized that regardless of changes in the potential output growth, two factors  on the one hand, a decline in the current account deficit considered safe by financial market participants, and, on the other hand, rising deficit in public finance  could support a possible increase of the equilibrium interest rate
In the opinion of some Council members, in the longer term weaker economic activity can also be expected in China, where the limited possibilities of further export growth mean that domestic demands role will have to increase, which, considering demographic factors and the absence of a social security system, will be difficult
Those members also pointed out that, in line with economic growth outlook for 2010, strong GDP growth could be expected in Asian and Latin American economies as well as further improvement in economic activity in the United States with relatively lower GDP growth in European economies
Notwithstanding that, it was pointed out that over almost the whole horizon of the March projection  assuming no change in the NBP policy rates  inflation remains above the inflation target
The persisting strong cost pressure also contributed to a slight rise in the annual growth of food prices
In the opinion of these Council members, low interest rates have a negative impact on the performance of the banking sector, which strengthens the tendency to concentrate banking activity in market segments yielding high margins
Yet, the majority of the Council members assessed that with time the deteriorating economic situation in the euro area and the United States would be reflected in higher unemployment, which was also anticipated by the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve of the United States
Some Council members assessed however, that inflation returning to the target is subject to risk posed by global commodity prices, whose further growth may be supported by strongly expansionary monetary policy conducted by major central banks
In the opinion of these Council members, interest rate decisions should take into account in particular the impact of negative real interest rates on lending, asset prices and savings in the Polish economy, as well as growth in the unit variable costs
These members argued that the interest rate increases are justified by a faster acceleration in price growth than assumed in the July projection expected by them and a high risk of severe external shocks
At its meeting, the Monetary Policy Council discussed current and future monetary policy decisions against the background of expected growth and inflation trends in Poland, which will be strongly affected by both external conditions growth outlook abroad, situation in the financial markets, commodity prices and domestic factors, as well as the exchange rate developments
It was emphasized that the reduction in interest rates in the first half of 2013 and their stabilisation in subsequent quarters supported the recovery of the domestic economy, a return of inflation to the target and stabilisation in the financial markets
The majority of the Council members underlined that according to the available forecasts the output gap would remain negative in 2021, which  along with the still heightened uncertainty and weaker sentiment of economic agents than in previous years  would hold back investment growth
At the same time, employment in the enterprise sector, primarily in industry, remained lower than a year earlier
Despite this, the fall in inflation in many economies is gradual, since the rapid growth in nominal wages, the relatively good economic situation in services, as well as the pass through of the earlier sharp increases in production costs on consumer prices and the relatively high corporate profits are supporting further price growth
In Germany, which is Polands main trading partner, growth in economic activity is stable and the surveys indicate high export orders in this country
The Council members emphasised that energy commodity prices  despite a recent uptick  remained considerably lower than in previous years
It was also highlighted that there was a risk of inflation persisting at heightened level in the subsequent months, which would be attributable to the observed rise in commodity prices in the global markets
It was pointed out that euro area growth continued to be mainly driven by consumer demand, supported by relatively strong consumer sentiment and the improvement in the labour market conditions compared to previous years
These Council members emphasised that growth in goods prices remained very low, while core inflation was propelled by rising services prices, partly driven by increases of certain administered charges, and partly by rising wages that reflected convergence of the Polish economy
It was assessed that the deceleration of recessionary tendencies in Poland may be indicated by the slower decline of industrial output, an improvement in some business confidence indicators and the fact that part of the data for June proved better than expected
At the same time, Council members recognized that the findings of the March NBP projection would enable a more comprehensive assessment on the horizon of keeping the interest rates at the current level
In particular, it was indicated that in May 2022 the euro area had seen HICP inflation rise to 8.1 with some euro area economies recording double-digit inflation
Some Council members assessed that the increased spending on social benefits  including the introduction of the Family 500 programme  might stimulate consumption growth
The majority of the Council members pointed out that in the current global economic conditions, real interest rates were at negative levels in many countries, including in all the economies of Central and Eastern Europe, and that their level in Poland was among the highest in the region
At the same time, these Council members pointed out that exchange rate fluctuations were closely connected to shifts in risk aversion in the global financial markets that are hard to predict
In this context, it was pointed out that the wage growth in the enterprise sector had been low and the real wage fund had declined
The Council decided to raise the interest rates to the following levels the reference rate to 3.75, the lombard rate to 5.25, the deposit rate to 2.25 and the rediscount rate to 4.00
This translated, in particular, into further deterioration of the labour market situation in many countries, which, combined with unresolved capital shortfall of some euro area banks, hampered growth of the euro area economy
Moreover, those members pointed out that the competitiveness of exports was positively affected by a decline in unit labour costs in industry
At the meeting, a motion to cut the NBP interest rates by 0.25 percentage points was submitted
Members of the Council expecting somewhat faster GDP growth in the coming quarters, however, pointed to rising retail sales and industrial production and weakening decline in construction in the recent months, as well as signs of a possible rebound in investment over the subsequent quarters rise in the estimated cost and number of newly started investment
Moreover, consumption will be adversely affected with limited room for a further decline in savings rate
The majority of the Council members stressed that continued uncertainty regarding the external and domestic determinants of monetary policy was another argument in favour of stabilization of interest rates at the current meeting
Consumer expenditures are supported by improving labour market conditions, reflected particularly in rising employment and a fall in the unemployment rate, which had reached the lowest level since 2008
At the meeting, it was noted that the global economic conditions remained weakened, although they varied across the major economies
Other Council members, however, argued that, taking into account uncertainty as to the sustainability of the recovery in the world and in the Polish economy, as well as the unknown impact of the expected macroeconomic policy tightening abroad on future world economic growth and inflation, the probabilities of inflation running below and above the target in the medium term were still balanced and the NBP interest rates should remain unchanged in the coming period
At the same time, European prices of coal and gas were several times higher than a year ago
Other members of the Council reasoned that the rise in the world prices would be a factor beyond the impact of the monetary policy conducted by central banks of countries regarded as small open economies
Yet, annual inflation remained above the upper limit of deviation from the NBP inflation target
During the meeting, the Council noted that incoming data from the global economy indicated a stabilisation of economic growth at a relatively low level
Other Council members argued that the monthly increases in housing loans to households remained at a relatively high level lower only to that in 2007-2008, while loans to companies had been steadily rising for several months
It was pointed out that unemployment in July stayed at a historic low, while corporate employment continued to increase
In this context, certain Council members pointed to the surveys results indicating a considerable surge in the percentage of firms declaring an increase in wage pressure
Referring to the interest rates, the Council decided that they should remain unchanged at the current meeting
It was pointed out that inflation would be raised by strong increases in the prices of agricultural commodities in the world observed in recent months
The Council members observed that GDP growth in the euro area in 2019 Q2 continued to be sluggish
Referring to the recent data on economic activity abroad, it was also pointed out that the deteriorating economic conditions in developed countries translated into weaker growth in major emerging market economies
According to those Council members, the absence of a revival in lending to the corporate sector and a possible tightening of banks lending policies due to the deterioration of their loan portfolio might be conducive to the reduction of corporate investment, especially of small and medium-sized enterprises
The absence of inflationary pressure is also signalled by negative growth of producer prices, amidst low inflation expectations of economic agents
Certain Council members were of the opinion that in these conditions the decisions on interest rates should take into account their impact on the financial markets
Some members of the Council also pointed at other inflation forecasts which had been recently revised downwards
Factor having an adverse effect on economic activity in the euro area  according to those members of the Council  was the on-going process of deleveraging in the private sector and tightening of the fiscal policy
This was reflected in a monthover-month decline in retail sales observed in March
While addressing the situation in the external environment of the Polish economy, the deepening recession in developed economies the United States, the euro zone, Japan and the increasing slowdown in economic growth in developing countries was noted
Other members of the Council, however, argued that, due to a large import intensity of export production, the zloty exchange rate appreciation did not significantly reduce the profits of exporters, which may be confirmed, among others, by the data on the financial results of enterprises in 2007
Certain Council members underlined that price growth took place amid continued moderate lending growth
In consequence, the rate of economic growth would fall, diminishing the investment attractiveness of the Polish economy and leading to a decrease in the inflow of foreign direct investment
When the effects of the energy price increase fade  amid the current NBP interest rates level  inflation should return to the medium-term NBP target, although the impact of higher energy prices on inflation expectations is an uncertainty factor
When referring to the Polish economy, it was pointed out that the rise in COVID-19 infections and the tightening of the epidemic restrictions in 2020 Q4 had had a negative impact on economic activity in this period, which was particularly noticeable in part of the services sector
A few of these members additionally indicated that interest rate cuts may weaken the zloty exchange rate, and thus negatively affect inflation, as well as prompt households to deposit savings outside the banking system
At the same time, it was emphasised that except for Poland and Slovakia all the new member states of the European Union which remained outside the euro area failed to comply with this criterion
While discussing current inflation developments, it was emphasized that price growth continued on a downward trend
Other members of the Council indicated, however, that despite some decline, inflation continued to run considerably above the target as well as above the upper limit for deviations from the target, and in line with the NBPs March projection, inflation was also likely to remain above 3.5 in a oneyear horizon
The Council concluded that leaving the interest rates unchanged was justified by the information about the Polish and global economic situation that had been released since the previous meeting
It was pointed out that this had largely resulted from the expiry of the temporary cuts in VAT rates in that country
On the other hand, some Council members indicated that the recently observed euro depreciation, increasing the price competitiveness of euro area exports could favourably affect the economic growth in this region
Some discussants emphasised that domestic inflation is to an increasing extent determined by global factors
Some Council members did not rule out the possibility of interest rate cuts in the case of an economic slowdown in Poland, deepening deflation or signs that behaviour of economic agents was adversely affected by negative price growth
Those members indicated that 2009 was expected to bring a further strong decline in economic activity in the euro area and some forecasts pointed to the risk of GDP fall in this region also in 2010
Some Council members emphasised that rising unit labour costs may reduce the competitiveness of the Polish economy and bring about further deepening of external imbalance
When discussing the outlook for economic growth in the context of the July projection, it was indicated that GDP growth would be relatively stable at close to 3.5 over the whole projection horizon
Other Council members, however, pointed out that all measures of core inflation had risen since the previous month and the increase in core inflation net of food and fuel prices was significant as compared to the changes of this indicator over the past year
Those members claimed that wage growth in Poland was very high in comparison to the majority of Central and Eastern European countries
They assessed that rising unemployment would be conducive to lowering the inflationary pressure through weaker consumer demand and limited wage pressure
Moreover, some members of the Council pointed to the risk of decline in real wages in the economy which might lead to further reduction in consumption
Among factors having a negative impact on consumption demand were also listed deteriorating consumer sentiment and decreasing purchasing power of households incomes driven by increases in administered prices
Yet, it was emphasised that global inflation remained high
However, the majority of the Council members were of the opinion that even in the face of growing demand, growth in oil prices should slow down
It was also pointed out that Poland is among the EU countries whose business cycles are most closely correlated with the business cycle in the euro area which means that the slowdown in the euro area would probably have a negative impact on economic growth in Poland
At the same time, the gradual decline in the non-resident holdings of Polish sovereign bonds has been reducing the risks associated with debt financing by foreign capital
The Council members were of the opinion that the present meeting should keep interest rates unchanged and continue to pursue NBPs remaining measures
A view was also expressed that in the hypothetical event of a slump in economic activity accompanied by a marked deterioration in consumer and corporate sentiment, in the longer run it might be justified to consider a decrease in interest rates or the introduction of unconventional monetary policy instruments
While addressing inflation, some members of the Council emphasized that although CPI inflation declined slightly in November 2010 it was still running above the inflation target of 2.5
This was reflected in the preliminary estimates of GDP, according to which annual GDP growth in 2021 Q3 stood at 5.3, therefore had turned out to be higher than expected
The persistence of other significant sources of uncertainty was also underlined, including, among others, the tense geopolitical situation, commodity price developments and the economic conditions in the environment of the Polish economy
However, in the opinion of some Council members, an increase in lending by cooperative banks called for the adoption of measures aimed at raising regulatory capital of this sector
In Poland the economic conditions in the first months of the year were relatively good
It was pointed out that in some countries  even those with a high number of vaccinated people  the number of infections with the new variant of the virus was increasing, which was contributing to the reintroduction of certain restrictions
Economic growth will be supported by expected rise in investment resulting from higher inflows of EU funds, amid a steady rise in consumption
Along with slow growth in unit labour costs, this contains a risk of rising cost pressure
It was also underlined that there were no signs of rising imbalances in the domestic economy
While discussing inflation developments in Poland, it was pointed out that annual consumer price growth had decreased at the beginning of 2018, and that core inflation net of food and energy prices remained low
It was pointed out that net exports also had a positive contribution to GDP growth in 2015 Q3
In turn, certain Council members judged that in the coming months it might be justified to consider beginning of interest rate increases, since, in their view, inflation pressure could appear due to favourable labour market conditions and the risk of a significant acceleration in consumer demand growth
If it is to be achieved by limiting expenditure, it may contribute to increasing the propensity of enterprises to invest by reducing concerns about a future rise in the tax burden and by easing the wage pressure
At the Council meeting, it was observed that the recovery in global economic activity was continuing
In this context, those members highlighted the fact that  according to the projection  the expected gradual return of inflation to the target will be related to the narrowing of the output gap and its subsequent stabilisation at a positive, yet close to zero level
Attention was drawn, in particular, to the fact that in April growth in industrial output had slowed down somewhat, and that in May the PMI index for industry had fallen below the level of 50 points
The response of monetary policy to the shocks is flexible and depends on their causes and the assessment of persistence of their effects, including their impact on inflation developments
Some Council members pointed out that the currently heightened inflation resulted largely from high growth in administered prices mainly prices of non-market services related to flat maintenance and energy prices not directly influenced by monetary policy
It was emphasised that the projection assumed that inflation would return to the NBP inflation target, i.e
When referring to the medium-term outlook, it was pointed out that the potential increase of inflation in the second half of 2024 might also influence inflation expectations
At the same time, given the strength and persistence of the earlier shocks, which remained beyond the impact of domestic monetary policy, the return of inflation to the NBP inflation target would be gradual
Growth forecasts for India had recently been revised markedly downwards
Yet, some members of the Council judged that the previous interest rate increases along with considerable appreciation of the zloty exchange rate and expected economic slowdown might prove sufficient to bring inflation down to the target in the medium term
Those members also expressed the opinion that the rising percentage of companies unable to cover interest expenses out of their profits was a negative phenomenon
Moreover, for some banks it could result in the need to increase their capital
It was stressed that this was accompanied by stable wage growth in the enterprise sector
It was emphasised that heightened inflation in Poland  as in other countries  was mainly driven by a sharp rise in global prices of energy and agricultural commodities which was largely the result of the Russian military aggression against Ukraine
While analyzing the situation in the public finance sector, it was pointed out that a low growth rate of budget income in the first five months of 2009, including a considerable decline in tax revenues, which, given the persistently high expenditure growth, had led to a rapid increase in budget deficit
In this context, it was pointed out that although a further reduction of fiscal imbalances will hamper GDP growth in the short term, abandoning it would be viewed negatively by financial markets, which would increase both the cost of public debt servicing and the risk of macroeconomic destabilization
Certain Council members were of the opinion that given the anticipated increase in inflation in the coming quarters and the related possible rise in inflation expectations, real interest rates would decrease
While discussing the economic outlook for Poland, Council members highlighted that the November projection pointed to lower GDP growth than in the previous round
They assessed that the current slowdown in lending was to a large extent a cyclical phenomenon and that it would be conducive to a more balanced lending growth
In reference to the economic activity outlook, the Council members assessed that Russian military aggression against Ukraine would weaken economic growth in Poland, although the scale of this effect was highly uncertain
Yet, in the assessment of the Council, this most probably was due to temporary factors
The discussion at the meeting focused on the outlook for economic growth abroad and in Poland, the medium-term inflation outlook, fiscal policy and the situation in the banking sector
At the same time, a deterioration in residential real estate market conditions was not excluded given higher mortgage interest rates
It was underlined that effective measures in this area were key for the ability of economies to restore activity quickly after the resolution of the current disruptions
At the same time, the Council pointed to the risk of Polish exports weakening more markedly, should growth in China decelerate considerably, resulting in smaller exports from Germany to that country
Some Council members additionally observed that in Central and Eastern Europe  despite inflation running above the targets in some of the economies  central banks had not signalled a tightening of monetary policy
Certain members of the Council also observed that Poland had a chance to recover relatively quickly from the recession
At the same time, it was underlined that core inflation in the environment of the Polish economy, including the euro area, had also increased slightly
When analysing labour market performance, it was pointed out that employment growth in the corporate sector was still close to 3 at the beginning of 2019, while wage growth in enterprises in January and February 2019 amounted to approx
They emphasized that countries which at that time decided to conduct a relatively restrictive macroeconomic policy managed to keep inflation at a fairly low level
They pointed out that although the exchange rate appreciation is an effective channel of curbing inflation, excessive currency strengthening poses a risk of too severe an economic slowdown and of a worsening external balance
An additional argument for interest rate stabilisation was elevated uncertainty regarding domestic and external conditions for monetary policy
Other Council members argued that GDP in Poland had been positively affected by stimulation packages introduced in other countries that are currently expiring and they assessed that economic growth would remain moderate
They pointed out that postponing the decision to raise the interest rates may contribute to rising macroeconomic imbalances and inflation
It was observed that since 2021 Q2 annual price growth would also be increased by base effects related to the waning of the impact of the 2020 decline in oil prices
These concerns also brought about a fall in the prices of natural gas and industrial metals
As a result, at present a significant portion of government bonds in advanced countries have negative yields
However, other Council members noted that nominal rates were at record lows, and real rates would decline along with forecasted rise in price growth
However, other members of the Council indicated that this rule should rather be used in ex post assessments
It was observed that the main factor behind softer activity growth was the deterioration in economic conditions abroad
Certain Council members additionally drew attention to notable acceleration in production of minerals used in construction in late 2016
At the same time, in their opinion, further NBP interest rate cuts would not support demand in the economy, as the current downturn was mainly caused by weak sentiment of economic agents and low external demand growth
The majority of Council members were of the opinion that considering the expected subdued economic activity globally and in Poland, low forecast inflation abroad and relatively low commodity prices in the global market, inflation would be low in the subsequent years
Referring to the July NBP projection, some members of the Council emphasized that the central paths of GDP and inflation in Poland were slightly lower than those in the March projection; yet, this was mainly visible for the coming quarters
Some members of the Council argued that a limited scale of lending to the private sector and the bad situation in the real estate market, on the one hand, and the persistently high budget deficit, on the other, constitute risk factors to a permanent recovery of economic growth in the United States
In the opinion of some members of the Council this means that zloty appreciation may have a stronger impact on Polish foreign trade than previously estimated
Certain Council members judged that the rising prices of this commodity reflected an optimistic assessment of the outlook for global demand by investors, supported by the progress of the COVID-19 vaccination programmes and the highly expansionary economic policy in many countries
The Council members observed that considering the above macroeconomic conditions, the major central banks were signalling the maintenance of interest rates at a level close to zero and continued asset purchases in the subsequent quarters
In this context it was pointed out that the current zloty exchange rate was stronger than in the June projection based on the NECMOD model and thus future inflation might prove lower than it followed from the projection
These involve growing demand pressure and a raise in local taxes, as well as higher prices of gas and some services related to the general government sector
According to those Council members, in the light of available data the consolidation measures planned by the government may prove insufficient to reduce the public finance sector imbalances in line with the objectives outlined in the Convergence Programme  2009 Update
Moreover  in the opinion of these Council members  in the case of many economies a reduction in interest rates should not be expected in the coming years
According to these Council members, apart from regulatory factors, price growth would be also boosted by base effects related to the fading impact of the fall in oil prices in 2020
Some members of the Council emphasised that in the light of available forecasts inflation in the coming months would continue to decline, driven mostly by statistical base effects connected with a strong rise of administered prices in 2009, the appreciation of the zloty observed so far, moderate growth of unit labour costs and the currently low demand pressure
More specifically, those members highlighted a clear decline in core inflation rates observed in recent months, which besides statistical effects - largely reflected an earlier appreciation of the zloty exchange rate and easing of cost and demand pressures
At its meeting, the Monetary Policy Council discussed the current and future monetary policy decisions against the background of external and domestic macroeconomic developments, including inflationary processes and the NBPs March projection of inflation and GDP
In the Councils assessment, in the conditions of increased uncertainty associated with the turmoil in international financial markets, the balance of risks for future inflation pointed to the necessity of a monetary policy tightening
At the same time, they pointed out that increased liquidity in the interbank market might impede exchange rate stabilization
It was emphasised that the relatively low GDP growth may be the result of a drop in real disposable income of households connected with a rise in unemployment and a decline in real wages as well as more difficult access to credit
In this context it was noted that inflation returning close to the inflation target in 2021 was suggested not only by the central path of the March projection, but also by external forecasts
Those members emphasised that in Poland, similarly as in many other countries of the region, the level of nominal interest rates necessary to keep inflation at the target level was higher than in the euro area, among other things, due to the higher economic growth, resulting from higher labour productivity growth
At the same time, it was highlighted that GDP growth had remained relatively low as for this country
The good situation of employees on the labour market was evidenced by unemployment staying low despite the gradual winding down of the programmes subsidising wages under the anti-crisis shields
While discussing the future economic situation it was assessed that the slowdown in economic growth would also be driven by a decline in consumption and export growth, and GDP growth in 2008 Q4 and in subsequent quarters would most probably be lower than anticipated in the NBPs October projection
The Council discussed the indicated period of the probable maintenance of the NBP interest rates at an unchanged level
These Council members expressed the opinion that further adjustment of interest rates  while reducing the cost of servicing the public debt only temporarily  could lead to increased instability of public finance in the future
Taking this into account, the Council members underlined that it was necessary to continue to analyse the business conditions of enterprises and consumer behaviour for possible adverse effects of the negative price growth
Moreover, certain Council members argued that the recent depreciation of the zloty could improve price competitiveness of Polish exports, leading to higher GDP growth
According to the LFS data, the number of working persons in the economy in 2022 Q4 remained close to the level recorded a year before, while it declined in the private sector
The persistence of moderate inflation in the euro area, related to low wage pressure in this economy and the appreciation of the euro, spoke in favour of preserving the strongly accommodative monetary policy of the ECB
In turn, the increasing absorption of EU funds, favourable demand outlook as well as high capacity utilisation were conducive to the recovery in investment
It was emphasised that the Forecast of the Balance of Payments of the Republic of Poland for the year 2008, which was adopted during the meeting, pointed to a building-up of the external imbalance of Poland
While discussing the outlook for bank lending, some members of the Council assessed that banks credit policy towards enterprises continued to be restrictive
They pointed to the gradually improving situation in the labour market, including a decline in the unemployment rate and further steady wage growth, which supported retail sales growth
At the same time it was indicated that a decline in food and energy price growth had significantly contributed to a decrease in inflation over recent months
At the same time, in Germany  Polands main trading partner  economic growth accelerated
It was observed that the rise in the number of COVID-19 cases also contributed to deteriorating sentiment in international financial markets, which was reflected in a weakening of emerging market currencies, a decline in equity prices and a decrease in the prices of some commodities
At the same time, certain Council members pointed out that the transmission of higher wages to prices might depend on many factors, including the speed of the recovery in domestic economic activity, changes in corporate profitability, and also the households propensity to save
It was observed that in China activity growth has been gradually slowing down as well
In the opinion of some Council members, the somewhat slower growth of lending to the private sector in August 2011 may also point to the absence of mounting inflationary pressure
It was emphasised that high commodity prices, prolonged disruptions in global supply chains and international transport, exacerbated by the effects of the war, remained the main source of rising inflation
Few Council members pointed to an unfavourable phenomenon of a decrease in household deposits growth in the banking sector
It was assessed that the relatively high resilience of the Polish economy to unfavourable external shocks  the turmoil in the global financial markets and the recession abroad  was, among other things, the result of a low credit-to-GDP ratio and the economys lower degree of openness as compared to other EU countries, as well as of the dynamic development of the service sector less dependent on global economic developments observed in the past few years
Yet, the majority of Council members concluded that the financial sector showed no sign of imbalances or any tangible risk of their occurrence in the future
In this context, the Council members expressed the opinion that developments in core inflation were of significant importance for the assessment of domestic inflation processes
However, it was underlined that despite a slight recovery, activity in this economy was still weakened, with a better economic situation in those euro area countries with whom Poland has less economic ties
In the opinion of those Council members, this may be a factor easing the inflationary pressure
It was judged that this was a sign of the increasing impact of the weakened conditions in the external environment of the Polish economy on external sales and domestic economic activity
The majority of the Council members assessed that the weakening of the external economic conditions, together with lower commodity prices, would continue to curb global inflation, which would still contribute to lower price growth in Poland
It was indicated that in recent years the links between economic conditions, wage growth and inflation had weakened in many countries
Those members pointed out that rapid economic growth in the developing Asian countries leads to growing demand of these countries for euro area exports, thus contributing to GDP growth in the euro area
They also indicated that the share of private investment was low compared to other EU member states
In particular, a marked weakening was visible in the activity and survey indicators for Germany, which is Polands main trading partner
According to the majority of the Council members, the effects of NBP earlier monetary policy tightening could still be seen in the credit market
With reference to price developments, the majority of the Council members highlighted a further decrease of the CPI annual index, which has been running below the lower limit for deviations from the NBP inflation target since February 2013
The Council members noted that the rise in inflation in recent months resulted mainly from increases in the administered prices of energy carriers and  though to a lesser extent  an increase in annual growth in the prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages
It was underlined that high commodity prices, driven partly by the consequences of Russias military aggression against Ukraine, continued to be a significant source of high price growth in many economies
In this context, a few Council members pointed out that given the low growth in the external environment of the Polish economy and the persisting risk of deterioration in economic conditions abroad, the strength of further economic recovery in Poland was uncertain
However, it was emphasised that the unemployment rate has persisted at elevated levels, thus hampering wage pressure in the economy
It was also stressed that core inflation was increasing as well, while inflation forecasts for the coming quarters were revised up, which pointed to the risk of longer than previously judged impact of the pandemic shock on inflationary processes, which in Europe was additionally exacerbated by strong negative effects of Russias supply policy in the gas market
In the opinion of the majority of the Council members, the interest rate cuts both at the current and at the previous meetings, will help to ease monetary conditions and support higher economic growth, and consequently, help to bring inflation close to the target in the medium term
However, some Council members emphasised that in the recent period the risk of a sharp slowdown in economic growth in China had declined, which was indicated by the better than expected GDP data
Other members of the Council judged that a certain reallocation of savings  in line with households preferences as regards the accepted risk-to-profit ratio  might be favourable for the economy
It was emphasised that households real disposable income had risen considerably in 2017, while income inequalities had narrowed down
Some Council members pointed out that the fall in oil prices was the result of a slowdown in global economic growth and the persistence of negative signals regarding the global economic outlook
Those members pointed out that the likely slowdown in the world economy might lead to a slowdown in economic growth in Poland
Referring to the external conditions for inflationary processes, few members of the Council emphasised that in the medium term a significant curbing of inflation in Poland would be made difficult by the persistently elevated inflation abroad and continuously high commodity prices in the global markets, related - in their opinion  to strongly expansionary monetary policy pursued by major central banks, including considerable excess liquidity in the global financial markets
It was also pointed out that this uncertainty was reflected in movements of the prices of Polish assets and the zloty
In the coming quarters, consumer price growth is likely to increase and will be running above the NBP inflation target, which will be driven by higher energy prices
During the discussion it was emphasised that the labour market situation remained very good, as reflected in the record low unemployment rate and the continued marked wage rises
Concurrently, the ECB continued to purchase financial assets, although it has announced the end of the purchases by the end of the year
Higher GDP growth in 2017 would also be supported by the expected increase in investment related to greater EU funds absorption, as indicated by a rise in the number of new financial framework contracts
If inflation overshot the inflation target at that point, this could hinder the stabilisation of the exchange rate within the ERM II
the difference between the collected deposits and granted loans
Yet, it was indicated that investment expenditures remained low
These Council members drew attention to a gradual deceleration in household deposit growth over the previous six months, which, starting from early 2017, was accompanied by higher inflows to investment funds from the household sector
Other discussants pointed out that the turmoil in international financial markets did spread beyond the US subprime loan market, which can be evidenced by problems in the German and British financial markets
According to certain Council members, there was increased risk of a strong external shock which  by weakening the economic growth of Polands trading partners and causing a deterioration in investors sentiment towards the assets of emerging markets  could lead to a slowdown in Polish GDP growth
In Central and Eastern Europe, price growth was also decreasing, although it remained higher than in the euro area
Therefore, GDP growth would probably be higher in 2025 than in 2024 whereas, according to the projection, in the following year it may slow down slightly
Some members of the Council also judged that the expected acceleration in the growth of prices would bring about a decline in real interest rates
Referring to the outlook for inflation, it was observed that moderate price growth in the external environment of the Polish economy and the stronger zloty than in the previous year would continue to have a curbing effect on price developments
In this context, it was concluded that amidst probable further recovery in economic activity and favourable labour market conditions, inflation might persist at an elevated level longer than hitherto expected
On the other hand, some discussants indicated that zloty appreciation might stem from the appreciation of the real equilibrium exchange rate related to the convergence process
While analysing external conditions for economic activity in Poland, Council members pointed out that the global activity remained low
However, few Council members were of the opinion that the NBP interest rates should be kept unchanged due to persistently elevated current inflation and remaining uncertainty about global energy commodity prices
Other Council members emphasised, however, that the level of the real interest rates was not the main factor determining the savings rate and asset prices
It was stated that although GDP growth in the German economy was higher in 2019 Q1 than at the end of 2018, this was partly the result of temporary factors
These Council members judged that the persistence of such price growth would mainly be caused by factors beyond the control of monetary policy, including regulatory factors and possibly the process of deglobalisation
Referring to the change in VAT rates scheduled for the beginning of 2011, members of the Council pointed out that the increase in the price level driven by this change should be rather insignificant, and given stable inflation expectations, its impact on CPI inflation might be expected to be only temporary
It was indicated that economic conditions had deteriorated in Germany, Polands key trading partner, which had been partly attributable to a number of one-off factors, such as strikes related to pay negotiations or unfavourable weather conditions
While analysing the external conditions of macroeconomic developments in the Polish economy, members of the Council pointed to the continued uncertainty about the situation in the euro area
Some Council members were of the opinion that wage growth in the following quarters should not accelerate significantly and emphasised that the available forecasts indicated it would stabilise at around 7
It was also observed that such measures were justified by the temporary character of the factors currently boosting inflation, and the persistence of uncertainty about the future economic outlook
Other Council members argued that inflation expectations in Poland are adaptive in nature, and so they are greatly dependent on past inflation, which should be taken into consideration while interpreting their changes
In the opinion of these members, a halt in monetary policy tightening in Poland, due to disruptions in international financial markets, might suggest that the National Bank of Poland would in future ease monetary policy in the event of problems resulting from financial institutions incurring excessive risk, which could increase moral hazard
Some Council members assessed that the pace of zloty appreciation might have been excessive, arguing that since February 2009 the zloty had strengthened more than other currencies of the region
Another important argument for raising the interest rates were the recent decisions leading to a decrease in revenues and an increase in expenditures of the public finance sector, which may lead to a deterioration of the public finance balance and create additional inflationary pressure in the medium term
However, a few Council members noted the fact that core inflation ran at a level that in the past did not guarantee CPI inflation remaining within the tolerance band of deviations from the target
It was emphasised, however, that sentiment in manufacturing had weakened somewhat in February 2017
Nevertheless, significant uncertainty about the further development of the global pandemic persisted
However, in their opinion, in view of the persistently negative output gap, inflation was likely to remain at very low levels for several quarters ahead
Some Council members also emphasized that the weakening of the Polish trade with Russia and Ukraine, recorded already in 2013, had intensified in the first months of 2014
It was emphasised that the heightened uncertainty about the outlook for global growth negatively affected the risk sentiment in global financial market, which was reflected in rising bond yields of many emerging market economies and in a depreciation of their currencies
The continued high unemployment rate was also highlighted as a factor preventing potential escalation of wage pressure
While analysing current developments in the labour market, it was pointed out that the unemployment rate remained low and the annual growth of employment in the enterprise sector was still relatively high, although the level of employment in this sector had declined for the second consecutive month
While referring to the inflation outlook against the background of the NBP November projection, the majority of the Council members stressed that the projection confirmed a significant decline of risk that the coming quarters would bring intensification of demand pressure
Few Council members also expressed the opinion that the low price growth  amidst moderate economic growth in Polands external environment and a fall in commodity prices  was a normal phenomenon, and taking into account the expected persistence of these developments, inflation would most likely remain low also in the long-term
At the same time, GDP growth in the United States was to remain moderate in 2023
GDP growth in 2022 Q4  implied from the Statistics Poland preliminary data for the whole of 2022  was approx
Moreover, it was argued that contrary to previous expectations the consumption demand might also weaken considerably which was suggested by worse than expected November data on retail sales
The majority of the Council members were of the opinion that inflationary pressure remained limited
According to those members, a slight increase in interest rate should not dampen economic growth
It was observed that the resurgence of the pandemic inclined some governments to restore some of the restrictions  although, so far, milder ones than those introduced in response to the first wave of the pandemic  which, together with the flagging sentiment of economic agents would have a negative impact on economic activity
In addition, certain Council members expressed an opinion that wage pressure in the Polish economy would probably stay subdued due to weak bargaining position of Polish employees
Some Council members assessed that the economic growth could stay close to previous quarters
It was judged that low commodity prices were the key factor behind very low price growth worldwide
The majority of the Council members expressed the opinion that, taking into account current information, interest rates were also likely to remain stable in the coming quarters
At the same time, the ECB stood by its announcement that interest rates would remain at their current levels, even after the end of the asset purchase programme
In the opinion of those Council members the strong decline in inflation would be driven primarily by base effects connected with high increases in regulated prices at the beginning of 2009 and by a decline in import prices being the result of the hitherto observed zloty appreciation, which will also contribute to the decline in core inflation
Moreover, they pointed out that in February 2009 the inflation expectations of households and bank analysts declined
Furthermore, it was observed that financial analysts forecast inflation to decline to around 2.5 next year
The motion to lower the NBP interest rates by 75 basis points was passed, therefore the motions to lower the NBP interest rates by 25 basis points and by 50 basis points were not put to voting
The majority of the Council members judged that if the uncertainty about the further course of the pandemic, and  as a result  the future economic conditions continued, and if the rise in inflation above the target was the result of factors beyond the control of monetary policy, it would be advisable to keep interest rates unchanged also in the near future
Some members of the Council indicated that already in September 2008 CPI inflation had decreased as a result of a strong decline in the annual growth of food and fuel prices
In Italy GDP declined in 2014 Q1, and in France output did not change
