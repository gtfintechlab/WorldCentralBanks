A series of uncertainties have sowed the seeds of this concern, including the US-China trade conflicts, which are not merely some transitory events but represent fundamentally a contest for technological dominance
On balance, this director viewed that a rate hold would be the  appropriate decision
Against this background, in  order to contain domestic inflation expectations, the Board judged that a rate  hike  would  help  sustain  price  stability  and  foster  sound  economic  and  financial development on the whole
The  Non-Manufacturing  Index  NMI  and  its  six-month  outlook  subindex remained expansionary, pointing to sustained economic recovery and  manufacturing growth momentum picking up
Looking at next year, the base wage increase, the public sector pay raise, and potential price  hikes in some sectors to reflect higher personnel and raw material costs could push prices  upwards
For  the  first  five  months of the year, the average annual growth rates of the CPI and the core CPI were 1.39  and  1.13,  respectively,  representing  mild  price  uptrends  for  both
Recent data  also suggest that growth in construction loans of all banks have continued to slow
2 Discussion on the proposition to adjust selective credit control measures  Several board directors expressed the opinion that by introducing a new 70 cap  on the LTV ratio on second housing loans taken out by natural persons for homes in the  designated specific areas it would help enhance lending risk management of banks,  improve  proper  allocation  of  credit  resources,  achieve  a  healthy  housing  market,  and  promote financial stability
The CPI annual growth rate of food away from home has gone above 4 every month  since  February  2022,  except  for  February  2023
In sum, for the year to date, M2 and bank credit exhibited stable growth, indicating that credit market had sufficient liquidity to support real economic activity
As a result of mild inflation, Taiwans real interest rate has returned to positive territory, whereas many major economies continued to register negative real interest rates
In addition, given  that  changes  in  rental  costs  usually  lag  behind  housing  prices,  the  effect  of  further  housing price rises on rent and, in turn, on the CPI inflation requires monitoring
Nonetheless, with major institutions projecting a slower ascent for international  oil prices in 2022, the Bank expects the domestic CPI annual growth rate to drop to 1.59  and the core CPI to maintain mild growth at a pace of 1.45
The  recent  Russian  invasion  of  Ukraine  has  propelled  major economies to impose economic and financial sanctions on Russia, hampering  global commodity supply, inducing commodity price surges, and thereby creating  further inflationary pressures
Do the same factors  that have held inflation steady or down in the past three decades remain in sight?
In addition,  data  on  exports  in  the  year  up  to  May  showed  that  only  AI-related  ICTAV  exports  recorded  fast  growth  whereas  the  rest  product  categories  posted  negative  growth
For  this  year  as  a  whole,  the  annual  growth  rate  of  the  CPI  and  that  of  the  core  CPI were forecasted to register 2.22 and 2.44, respectively see Appendix  Table 2 for the forecasts by major institutions, lower than the 2022 readings  of 2.95 and 2.61
Meanwhile, housing transaction volume has gained a better footing, in tandem with price corrections
However, this outlook could still change depending on prices trends of  international commodities and domestic services, as well as weather events
Compared with major economies, Taiwans economy is projected to be relatively resilient in both 2020 and 2021
In addition, geopolitical risks and  climate  change could  also affect the progress of global disinflation
The  forecasts  by  international  and  domestic  institutions  for  Taiwans inflation next year average around 1.37
As of the end of April  2021,  the  annual  growth  rate  of  SME  loans  extended  by  banks  registered  13.46  and  the  annual growth rate of overall bank lending was 7.32
With weakening global demand, easing supply chain bottlenecks, and declining raw material prices, global inflation is expected to moderate in the coming year
With respect to global inflation, it was expected to soften this year as a result of the  effects from monetary tightening by major economies, global consumer demand cooling  off, and international energy prices trending down
One noted that, despite the impact from the pandemic, Taiwans economic fundamentals were stronger than many other economies
Regarding the CPI for rent, it climbed back up in August from a  modest  downswing earlier
In terms of  money supply, reflecting the slowdown in bank loans and investments and a  year-on- year increase of foreign capital outflows, as well as the Banks hikes of policy rates and  the RRRs, the M2 annual growth rate had trended downwards since May this year, with  the pace of growth averaging 7.66 for the first eight months of the year
Another board director stated that housing loans granted with high LTV ratios are susceptible to a price trend reversal that could  cause the amount of the loans to exceed the market value of their collaterals, creating credit risk  to banks; likewise, risk therefrom would be smaller if the LTV ratios are lower
Both  Japan  and  Germany  saw  their  10-year  government  bond  yields  climbing  upwards
As a small  open economy, Taiwan could be impacted by spillover effects via the following three  channels    The real economy With global final demand weakening, Taiwans exports have  seen  slower  growth  in  recent  months  and  private  investment  has  turned  conservative
As  a result, Taiwans headline inflation was mild compared to major economies
One board director pointed out that M2 growth still has influence on  prices over the longer term
Given the pandemics economic shock and rising uncertainties over the pandemic and economic and trade policies, international forecasters projected that it would be difficult for world trade volume to stage a strong recovery next year
Projections for Taiwans GDP growth rate in 2020 by major forecasting institutions fell between -1.36 and 1.83, and all of them expected next years growth to be faster, with projections ranging from 1.40 to 3.92
With regard to advanced economies, the US expansionary fiscal stimulus is likely to drive up global economic growth, while the outlook for Europe and Japan seems brighter on the back of growth in global manufacturing sectors and world trade
With global economic and trade activity on the mend,  demand  for  emerging  tech  applications  and  remote-working  products  staying  strong,  and  manufacturers  in  Taiwan  expanding  capacity,  the  Bank  projected  Taiwans exports  to  enjoy  solid growth in real terms this year
In respect of domestic economic conditions, several board directors discussed the issue of domestic investment growth momentum
If the RRRs are to be  raised further in the future, M2 growth would likely soften more markedly, which  could amplify the effect of denting inflation expectations
While discussing the interest rate decision, many board directors said that they have taken stock of domestic inflation outlook, economic growth, and the real interest rate and noted that current and expected inflation were both mild, the output gap was still negative, and uncertainties continued to weigh on economic prospects at home and abroad
Therefore, the director was in favor of keeping the policy rates steady
However, in addition to a slowing global economy, the continuous rise in US oil production would probably balance out the effect of production cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries
In terms of money supply trends since April this year, the annual growth rate of the  monetary aggregate M2 first rose to 6.25 in June alongside the rising annual growth  rate  of  loans  and  investments;  afterwards,  M2  growth  dropped  to  an  annual  pace  of  5.80 in August owing to net capital outflows
However,  an  upturn in the annual growth rate of housing loans from the second half of 2023 onwards  caused real estate lending to take up a large share in total bank lending
Data also  showed that building ownership transfers in these two area categories rose year on year  by  33.3  and  24.3  in  July  2024,  respectively
Under the circumstances, large capital flows could move to Taiwan, carrying adverse implications for the foreign exchange market, financial stability, and the real economy
And though the proposed NT200 billion Facility was preliminarily designed to run for a short term, an extension or expansion might be considered should the SMEs still remain financially strapped later on
For  the  outlook  of  the  entire  year,  domestic  commodity  prices  would  likely  rise  mildly given that international oil prices were forecasted  by foreign institutions to  go  modestly higher than 2023
The  director  then  cited  the  International  Monetary  Fund,  whose  World  Economic  Outlook  stated  that  continued  rate  hikes  by  major economies since last year caused the world to face  anemic economic growth in  the  next  five  years,  a  rocky  road  fraught  with  uncertainties
From June onwards, on account of the rebound in domestic food prices, the CPI annual growth rate displayed a mild uptrend and reached 0.96 in August
In terms of private consumption, the easing of pandemic containment measures and  border controls would bolster consumer confidence and retail and foodbeverage sales;  the planned hike in minimum wage and higher income tax-free allowance, as well as the  governments  universal  surplus  tax  rebate  program,  would  also  help  sustain  growth  momentum
One board director stated that the domestic inflation rate had been above 2 since April 2021 and was expected to remain so for the rest of 2022, longer than previously projected, while surveyed data also showed that experts and scholars still envisaged inflation exceeding 2 next year
Moreover,  though  being  closely  watched  by  the  Bank,  housing prices as an indicator does not in itself necessitate a systemic policy response
For the first eleven months of the year, the average annual growth rates of the  CPI and the core CPI were 1.91 and 1.28, respectively
Another  board  director  remarked  that  the  Bank  should  take  action  to  vigorously  fight inflation and, in particular, inflation expectations; therefore, the director supported  the rate hike proposition
Another board director pointed out that, despite a large basket of CPI components, the  public tend to response more strongly to the price rises in staple goods as they purchase these  items more frequently
Notwithstanding  the gradual slowdown in the inflation rate, persistent inflation remained a concern, and  it is crucial to continue monitoring how long the CPI annual growth rate would come  down below 2 since this would affect the anchoring of inflation expectations; it is also  important for monetary policy actions to be taken when necessary
To address the pandemics impact, major economies kept their monetary policy stances accommodative and continued to roll out large fiscal stimulus programs
The Bank forecasts this years CPI annual growth rate to be 1.07 and core CPI 1.11
The Bank will continue to closely monitor new developments of the coronavirus outbreak and the monetary policy actions by major economies, as well as the resultant effects on the economic and financial conditions at home and abroad
On the other hand, the selective credit control measures  could be  deployed to keep new property  investors and new speculators from entering  the housing market by denying them easy access to banks housing credit
The developments of the COVID-19 outbreak will be a key variable for Taiwans economy this year
At  the  meeting  today,  the  Board  decided  to  raise  the  discount  rate,  the  rate  on  refinancing of secured loans, and the rate on temporary accommodations by 0.125  percentage  points  each  to  1.875,  2.25,  and  4.125,  respectively,  effective  March 24, 2023
Inflation was expected to reach significantly higher levels compared to the previous year
The  US  dollar  index  rebounded  and  major  currencies broadly depreciated against the US dollar
For the year as a whole, it is expected that bank loans and investments will post mild growth
In the future, the Bank will continue reviewing the status of banks real estate lending  and the effectiveness of the Banks credit control measures, closely monitor potential  impacts of real estate sector-related policies on the housing market, and adjust the  measures  as  needed  in  order  to  promote  financial  stability  and  sound  banking  operations
With the Banks Special Accommodation Facility set to close soon, a further 25 basis-point rate hike would weigh on the services sector as well as the SMEs
On the other hand, though, this is neither the right time to begin a rate hike cycle, considering the absence of an overheating risk or strong growth momentum
In  regard  to  inflation,  elevated  services  prices  in  major  economies  had  led  to  a  slower  decline  in  core  inflation,  causing  the  disinflation  progress  to  stall
In view of this assessment, it  would be appropriate not to raise the policy rates
One director cited  the forecasts of the US headline and core price indices for personal consumption expenditures  PCE, released after the Federal Open Market Committees FOMC June Meeting, and pointed  out that US inflation could climb higher this year before declining next year
Two board directors noted that the Bank had adjusted the control measures twice since December 2020; they hoped this adjustment would also be well-received by the market
With respect to internal demand, private investment was expected to sustain growth  with  tech  firms  increasing  capital  outlay,  major  investment  projects    such  as  green  energy  and  government-supported  infrastructure  development    moving  along,  and  maritime and air transporters procuring new equipment
One board director noted that staple prices continued to face considerable upside  pressures, and energy prices, of which the rising costs had been absorbed by state-owned  oil and electricity enterprises i.e., the CPC and Taipower, could drive up prices after  the  electricity  tariffs  are  hiked  in  April
The primary points to this amendment are as follows Appendix 1      1  Granting no grace period to a natural persons first outstanding home loan when  the borrower already owns buildings to hisher name
Exports to all major destination economies, especially South Korea, China, and ASEAN, registered positive growth
This is aimed at preventing such borrowers from  using financial leverages for speculative homebuying and reinforcing banks  credit risk management
Second, while the unemployment rate has dropped to a recent low, the common phenomenon of low wages suggested that slack remained in the labor market
One board director noted that although  recent declines in  animal  feed costs took  pork prices lower, price stickiness would prevent related food-away-from-home prices  from decreasing correspondingly
Looking ahead, the global economy still faces downside risks, including 1 long-term scars to potential output of major economies as capital stock and labor force are constrained by the pandemic; 2 escalation in US-China trade tensions; 3 a worsening in financial fragilities as the necessary policy responses to the pandemic, such as large fiscal stimulus and ultra-loose monetary policy, aggravate the debt burdens of governments and firms
Meanwhile, the negative output gap and insufficient aggregate demand might create downward pressures on prices
The marked rebound in international raw material prices this year drove up prices of imports  and goods for domestic sales, stepping up pressures of imported inflation
Another board director noted that the effectiveness of the selective credit  controls was hampered by the liquidity flush in the domestic market
For this year as a whole, the Bank forecasts the CPI and core CPI annual growth rates to be -0.20 and 0.24, respectively Appendix Table 2
Nevertheless, the reserve requirement adjustment has not been frequently deployed, and the effect of such policy implementation on bank excess reserves and market interest rates would need to be closely monitored
Based on the assessment of domestic and international economic and financial conditions and prospects, the Board Directors all expressed approval of keeping policy rates unchanged
In  addition,  the  pace  of  Chinas  economic  recovery,  climate change, and geopolitical risks could weigh on commodity prices,  increasing uncertainties over global inflation trends
Such high concentration implied that Taiwans exports are vulnerable to changes in one or several particular industries or markets
For instance, private investment is forecast to expand faster in the coming three quarters from the second quarter onwards than last year, and the governments Forward-looking Infrastructure Development Program is also expected to propel growth in public and private investment this year
In terms of bank credit, as the annual growth rate of housing loans had picked up  since  the  second  half  of  2023  and  Taiwans  export  growth  stabilized  in  the  fourth  quarter, bank loans and investments gradually rose to an annual pace of 6.58 by the  end of 2023
Nevertheless, the director cautioned that  prices  of  services  continued  to  rise  markedly  and,  like  core  inflation,  tend  to  resist  downward change; it was important to prevent inflation expectations from firming up
We  will  also  monitor  the  results  of  the  regulations  and  measures  introduced  and  make  timely  adjustments  to  the  relevant measures as warranted
As the domestic economic upswing bolstered labor market conditions, employment increased and the unemployment rate dropped further
It was expected that exports  and  private  investment  would  both  post  negative  real  growth  this  year
Taiwans  Manufacturing  PMI  climbed  to  expansion  territory,  with  the  six-month  outlook  subindex  pointing  to  expansion  for  the  fourth  consecutive  month
For  next  year,  international institutions expected global oil prices to be steady; meanwhile, domestic  services inflation would likely continue with a gradual downtrend
For instance, exports of non-AI servers and mobile  phones  were  tepid
As real estate developers were keen on buying more land, the ensuing land price hikes also pushed up housing prices
For the first two months of the year, excess reserves  of banks averaged around NT54.9 billion
As mentioned, the domestic market interest rates have remained steady
In addition, such a tool would  require a massive scale to meaningfully affect housing market trends
In this  economic context, it would be necessary for the Bank to maintain its policy stance with  further  rate  hikes
By  contrast,  after  the  pandemic  concerns  receded, pent-up demand was released briskly, sending private consumption growth to  a  33-year  high  in  the  second  quarter  of  2023
Against this backdrop, stable monetary policy will provide some predictability for firms and investors in their investment decisions and thus galvanize domestic investment, which justifies keeping the policy rates unchanged for the time being
Another board director noted that the import price index in US dollar terms dropped  in the Jan.-Aug. period; in NT dollar terms, the index also fell despite NTD weakness  vis-à-vis  the  USD
Since the  Board  met in December  last  year, the global  manufacturing and services  sectors  have  witnessed  faster  growth,  and  trade  activity  has  gradually  recovered
As a result, the annual growth rate of domestic  banks loans and investments rose, with loans to small and medium-sized  enterprises  SMEs also expanding
One board director noted that strong housing demand was insufficiently met owing  to shortfalls in new projects for sale and new housing starts
In regard to domestic demand, growth in private investment would benefit from the  execution of deferred investment plans this year, and from further investment promises  by  major  chipmakers  and  semiconductor  supply-chain  firms  in  order  to  maintain  a  leading  edge  as  well  as  by  the  corporate  sector  moving  towards  net-zero  energy  transition
Therefore, the cut should be considered in a broader context, including accounting for the aforementioned interest rate spread and short-term capital issues
Data showed that there had been a large number of new borrowers taking out  their second outstanding housing loans, representing a share of about 17 in  the second quarter of 2024
Unabated  supply-demand  imbalance  owing  to  supply  chain  bottlenecks  and  the  Ukraine  war-induced  price  surges  amid  disrupted  supply  and  exportation  of  raw  materials exerted heavy pressures on global inflation, leading international institutions  to revise this years global inflation forecasts upwards
Another board director noted that since housing rents have a large weight among the CPI  basket, attention should be paid to whether housing price rises also lead to rent increases
Another board director also supported the adjustments, stating that the housing price trends  at present reflected a combination of supply-side and demand-side factors and the Bank would  need to demonstrate its resolve to keep the housing market from overheating
Board Directors expressed their opinions on the impact of exchange rate and stock price movements on financial conditions
Regarding the international economic situation, one Board Director expressed the view that though a global economic pickup is expected for this year, the longer-term growth trend is still weak
It is expected that the combined efforts would work in concert to promote steady growth for the Taiwan economy
From  the  beginning  of  this  year,  continuously  buoyant  demand  for  electronic  parts  and  components  and  information  and  communication  products,  as  well  as  stronger  sales  of  traditional manufacturing merchandise, boosted Taiwans export growth substantially
The Board decided unanimously to keep the policy rates on hold  At  the  meeting  today,  the  Board  considered  the  totality  of  economic  and  financial  conditions  at home and  abroad
Both  retail  and  foodbeverage  sectors  witnessed  the  strongest  sales  in  history  during  the  Jan.-Jul
In addition, the hikes in  minimum wage and public sector employee pay may spur wage increases for workers in the  private sector
Taiwans forecasts for CPI and core CPI to drop below 2 in 2023 already consider potential power tariff increases
Several board directors discussed the developments in the domestic housing market
Regarding  private  consumption,  post-pandemic  consumer  sentiment  for  travel  would  likely  remain  high,  while  household  disposable  income  would  gain  from  a  minimum wage hike, a public sector pay-raise, and a further rise in the income tax-free  basic living expenses allowance
Manufacturing and non- manufacturing sentiment for the outlook for the next six months also became cautious
Exports to Taiwans  major trading partners also registered a broad uptrend
During the first eight months of the year, the annual growth rate of the CPI averaged  2.32  mainly  owing  to  rising  food  prices  such  as  fruit  and  food  away  from  home,  housing  rent  hikes,  and  price  rises  in  personal  effects,  entertainment  services,  and  medical  fees,  which  combined  to  contribute  1.75  percentage  points,  or  about  75,  to  the rise in the CPI annual growth rate
One board director pointed out that although the 0.25 percentage point cut was in line with an assessment of the current economic disruption, the Bank could face renewed rate cut pressures if the coronavirus outbreak persists
Taiwans economy is projected to  exhibit strong growth this year, albeit with divergence among different sectors, and is also  expected to post solid growth next year as the global economic recovery continues onwards  amid potential downside risks
One  board  director  stated  that  continued  rate  hikes  by  various  central  banks  to  contain  inflation  had  inhibited  global  economic  growth
In addition, US-China trade negotiations are likely to achieve positive results, and global financial markets have rebounded significantly
Demand for currency increased prior to the Lunar New Year Holidays, which fell  in February this year
For next year, private consumption was  forecasted to grow mildly, with disposable income to be boosted by a scheduled hike in  the minimum wage and public sector pay next year and stronger corporate willingness  to raise pay thanks to stronger profits in the first half of this year
The domestic inflation rate would  gradually  come  down  this  year  from  the  levels  of  last  year  and  is  expected  to  decline  to  around  2  next  year
Banks average excess reserves stayed above NT60 billion
Policy Proposition To keep the discount rate, the rate on accommodations with collateral, and the rate on accommodations without collateral unchanged at 1.375, 1.75, and 3.625, respectively
As lockdowns and travel bans restricted the movement of goods and people, merchandise costs would increase and commodity exports and imports would be obstructed, both of which could push up domestic prices
One board director pointed to the spillover effect of the US monetary easing policy having a world-wide impact and noted that a small open economy like Taiwan would be especially vulnerable
The CBC forecasts CPI and core inflation for 2017 to rise 0.80 and 1.04 year on year, respectively
Considering  the above benefits and a higher base effect, the Bank projected that real private investment  would grow at a mild pace next year
Nonetheless, when  seasonal or irregular factors such as massive inflows or outflows of short-term capital lead to  excess  volatility  and  disorderly  movements  in  the  NT  dollar  exchange  rate  with  adverse  implications for economic and financial stability, the Bank, in line with its statutory mandates,  will step in to maintain an orderly market
Reviews  and  rectifications  will  then  be  conducted  after  some  time  into  the  policy  implementation,  with  a  focus  on  comprehensiveness and an understanding of specific cases
1 The domestic inflation slowdown was projected to continue, with the annual growth  rates of CPI and core CPI both forecasted to be 2.09
The  director  therefore  supported  the  proposition  to  raise  the  policy  rates  by  25  basis  points
Nevertheless,  effects  of  monetary tightening by major economies and unrelenting geopolitical conflicts  continued  to  hamper  global  economic  growth  momentum
Several board directors discussed economic uncertainties lying ahead and a wider US-Taiwan interest rate differential, and stated that the Banks monetary policy conduct should be more nimble
In the year to date, growth in banks  construction and housing loans continued to slow, real estate lending as a share of  total lending has broadly held steady, and the level of non-performing loan ratio for  real estate lending has stayed low
In addition, the relatively mild inflation in Taiwan was mainly supported by utility oil, electricity, natural gas, etc
Lowering the LTV ratio ceiling on mortgage loans for idle land in industrial districts to  50; stipulating that the well-defined period of time for the relevant exemptions to  apply shall be one year
Discussion on domestic and international economic and financial conditions In respect of the external environment, one board director noted that since the end of February international forecasting institutions and investment banks have actually adjusted their views on the global economic outlook given the Feds rate hike pause and a milder-than-expected slowdown in China thanks to Beijings massive stimulus measures
Private  investment,  whose  growth  has  long  been  highly  correlated  with  exports,  could  fare  poorly  this  year;  the  Bank  expected  private  investment  to  show  negative  growth in 2023 in consequence of sluggish export growth, ongoing inventory  adjustments, and cautious business outlook sentiment
Moreover, the Bank had bucked the trend for several years by keeping the rates unchanged when other central banks eased
Overall,  the  Bank  projected  exports  to  post  solid  growth this year and slower growth next year
Discussion on domestic and international economic and financial conditions Several board directors gave views on the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on Taiwans macroeconomic and price conditions
With regard to domestic demand, private investment  gained stronger momentum with capital equipment imports increasing  significantly  in recent  months, and private consumption continued growing
In  terms  of  economic  growth,  the  global  recovery  remains  on  track,  though  still  facing  multiple uncertainties
, spillover effect of Chinas economic slowdown,  and  global  economic fragmentations and supply chain restructuring, could all affect trade,  economic, and financial development of the  world
Domestic  inflation  is  expected  to  come down moderately in the second half of the year, bringing the inflation rate to  around 2 in the fourth quarter
Among international commodities, sharp declines in crude prices have exerted a downward pressure on global inflation
Recent data pointed to little change in domestic economic and financial conditions; combined with the Feds aggressive rate hikes, it would seem more fitting for the Bank to raise the policy rates by 25 basis points
Meanwhile, given the US-China  trade conflict, some supply chains could shift out of China, driving production costs upwards
The  Banks  survey  for  inflation  expectations  found  that,  compared  to  the  previous  quarter,  a  larger  share  of  respondents  in  the  corporate  sector  and  in  investment  trust  companies  expected  the  annual CPI growth rate to exceed 2, mainly because of international raw material price  rises and domestic price hikes by some firms
These have all exerted downward pressures on interest rates
This board director explained further in regard to M2 growth
One board director pointed to tepid exports and private investment and cautioned  that these sectors  remained  mired in negative growth despite some  signs of recovery
The Bank of Japan moved towards monetary policy  normalization,  and  the  Peoples  Bank  of  China  continued  with  its  accommodative  monetary policy stance
Survey data on inflation expectations showed more corporate respondents anticipating inflation above 2.5 within 12 months, reflecting rising international raw material prices and domestic price hikes
In terms of bank credit, with home mortgages and personal working capital loans  continuing to rise year on year since May 2024 and the corporate sector also showing  greater  funding demand amid steady  export growth,  the annual growth rate of banks  loans and investments rose month by month during the  year, averaging 7.73 for the  first eight months of 2024
1 Discussions regarding the policy rate decision  One board director pointed out that the domestic economy was gradually firming  up, and inflation continued with a broad downtrend without an expected surge following  the April electricity tariff hike
For the outlook of the second half of the year, with services inflation easing further,  the Bank expects the inflation rate to gradually come down in the second half of the  year
One board director pointed out that following the policy launch, the  Bank  will  strive  to  address  problems  and  difficulties
In the first half of this year, substantial foreign capital inflows have brought about an upsurge in foreign currency supply, resulting in NT dollar appreciation against the US dollar
The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war pushed up international raw material prices
Removing  the  grace  period  for  a  second  home  loan  taken  out  by  a  natural  person  for  housing located in the stipulated specific areas, namely Taipei City, New Taipei City,  Taoyuan  City,  Taichung  City,  Tainan  City,  Kaohsiung  City,  Hsinchu  County,  and  Hsinchu City
Meanwhile, a rate hike increases  funding costs, likely hindering corporate investment, exports, and private consumption
Taiwan has recently witnessed frequent short-term capital movements with adverse implications for the domestic forex and stock markets
The growth rate stood at 6.75 at the end of October and averaged 7.55 for the first ten months of the year
The Bank forecasted the domestic economy to expand by 1.92 this year, lower by 0.65 percentage points from the previous forecast in December 2019
In  this  light,  a  rate  hold  would be the sensible decision that would allow the Bank to pause for new information  such as the lagged effect of monetary tightening and take stock of a need for future rate  adjustments
Moreover, international prices of crude oil and other raw materials trended downward
As major economies such as the US and Europe still recorded high inflation and many central banks significantly tightened monetary policy, global economic growth is expected to slow further in 2023, with the US and Europe likely entering mild recessions
This could lead to deterioration  in asset quality
Average bank excess reserves stood at around NT70 billion
For small open economies like Taiwan, it has always been a difficult task to manage  inflation, as demonstrated by the effects of international crude oil price fluctuations on domestic  prices
Regarding labor market conditions in recent  months, job gains continued, the unemployment rate came lower than a year  ago, and nominal wage increased mildly
Inflationary pressures would be mild, given a slight moderation in the domestic economy and still below-potential output
This Director pointed out that co-movements between stock prices and exchange rates could create risks
The Bank projects that in 2021 the CPI and core CPI annual growth rates would rise to 0.92 and 0.62 respectively, noting the global economic recovery, higher oil prices as anticipated by international forecasters, and mild consumption demand at home
Given  the current economic and financial situation, the director supported a 25 bps rate hike  and  suggested  to  continue  monitoring  the  Feds  rate  path,  global  economic  developments, and domestic price trends while prudently formulating monetary policy
In terms of a rate cut, given the historically low levels  of the policy rates at present, the room and the effect of a reduction would be very limited
Therefore, selective credit control would be the right way to foster a sound real estate market
A rate cut decision this time would imply less room for future policy maneuver
Considering  that  real  estate-related  lending  still  takes  up  a  large  proportion  in  bank credit, the director agreed with the proposition to adjust selective credit controls  and to hike the RRRs in order to promote financial stability
Another board director pointed out that most major economies have kept  their policy rates unchanged since April this year in order to buttress the economic recovery
In respect of domestic demand, private investment grew at a slower pace mainly  because  raw  material  shortfalls  resulted  in  an  extension  of  equipment  delivery  time,  while labor shortage and inventory adjustments as well as a cautious economic outlook  prompted some firms to postpone capital expenditure plans
In terms of grain  prices, this  year had so far witnessed a downtrend as weather conditions in Argentine  and  US  crop  areas  improved  and  the  Black  Sea  grain  export  deal  was  extended
The  Bank  successively  met  with  a  total  of  34  domestic  banks  between  August  12  and  August  21
Furthermore, in the fourth quarter of 2020, more than half  at 54.51  of non-real estate and non-construction  related  corporations  sold  houses  within  one  year  of  purchase
Compared  to  the  projections  made in March 2024, the Bank upgraded the forecast of Taiwans 2024 GDP growth  rate by 0.55 percentage points, reflecting both a higher-than-expected GDP growth rate  in 2024 Q1 but also the Banks upward revision of the contribution from net external  demand and private investment to the 2024 GDP growth rate
Most  countries, including the U.S. and Japan, use the rental equivalence approach; their rent  is generally less susceptible to housing price changes, showing a more stable trend with  little deviation from the CPI
2 The global economy is shrouded in many uncertainties
Looking ahead, the global economy would have to move forward in a sea of uncertainties  likely  to  arise  from  1  a  significant  lack  of  effective  mass  vaccination;  2  rising  yields  on  longer-term bonds of major economies, which could cause financial conditions to tighten; 3  financial  fragilities  exacerbating  further  as  the  pandemic  aggravates  existing  inequality,  productivity slack, and debt burdens; 4 lingering global economic and trade uncertainties over  such  issues  as  US-China  relations,  as  well  as  unabated  climate  change  risks
Furthermore, the Bank had previously introduced the control measure of allowing no grace  periods for a second housing loan in eight specific areas. Should the real estate market remain  heated, more targeted prudential measures could be deployed to rein it in
Many  major central banks continued to raise their policy  rates to  tackle inflation whereas some economies still kept an accommodative monetary policy  stance or even reduced rates
For the first seven months of the year, the unemployment rate averaged 3.76, decreasing by 0.15 percentage points compared to the same period last year
Private consumption, on the other hand, was forecasted to continue expanding in  real  terms  as  the  domestic  economic  recovery  bolstered  consumer  confidence,  along  with brisk trading in the stock market
Price trends of international crude oil since early November 2021 showed a decline from  previous highs as oil demand was hampered by the U.S. efforts to increase local oil output and  by market concerns that the new variants could result in a fresh round of major outbreaks
Another board director stated that a widened output gap, which indicated deficient growth momentum and subdued inflation, and the likely year-long pause of rate hikes by the Fed gave little ground for Taiwan to raise policy rates
Meanwhile, both long- and short-term market interest rates slipped slightly downwards in recent months
Major stock markets  experienced  turbulence  in  recent  months  in  response  to  U.S.  inflation  data  and  Fed  policy paths
One board director pointed out that structural factors holding down global inflation have weakened somewhat
As the pandemic raged through the world, most economies saw steep cuts to their domestic growth forecasts, with the United States, the euro area, and Japan recently projected by international forecasters to register negative growth
Meanwhile, core CPI i.e.,  excluding  fruit  and  vegetables  and  energy  items  increased  by  2.57  year  on  year, abating rather slowly mainly because prices of foodbeverage and  travelaccommodation  services  were  buttressed  by  booming  demand  amid  the  post- pandemic reopening period
As for projections, the Bank expected to see extended growth  in real exports next year on account of robust development of emerging technology  applications, new capacity for advanced semiconductor production, and increased production  in Taiwan as firms re-distribute production plans
As  to  private  consumption,  tightened  containment  measures  in  response  to  the  domestic  COVID-19  flareup  restrained  consumer  spending  from  mid-May  onwards
If  inflation  shows  any hint of becoming unanchored by the next Board Meeting, the Bank should take a  stronger approach to contain inflation
In  addition, some banks might be caught ill-prepared upon an RRR hike, potentially putting  the Bank in a position  to provide  liquidity  as  seen fit
Such  policy measures include increasing the supply of social housing, raising the relevant tax levies,  etc
In this view, further US dollar strength would be on the horizon, as evident in the fact that the US dollar appreciated soon after the Feds announcement of the asset reduction plan
In addition, given Taiwans large trade surplus and foreign capital inflows, small capital outflows could help let out pressures of a domestic market flush with liquidity
The director therefore supported the proposed decision to not adjust  the policy rates
Several Board Directors also pointed out that monetary policy decisions should take into account both current inflationary pressures and the future inflation outlook
Recently,  residential rent seemed to be trending upwards,  and that uptrend was indicated by the  DGBAS CPI data using a compilation approach in line with the international principles
A noticeable improvement in global trade activity was evident in a strong rebound of the  WTO Goods Trade Barometer
Moreover, Taiwans nominal and real interest rates continue to register around the middle range among a host of economies Appendix Figure 1  Table 2
Major foreign stock indices generally rallied from June onwards
Meanwhile, domestic  demand was still sound in contrast to softening external demand
The domestic COVID-19 resurgence since mid-April caused companies to institute more furloughs, and consumers shied away from dining out and travel
Overall, the Bank expected the economy to be encumbered by the corornavirus outbreak for the first half of 2020 as manufacturing supply chains and the service sector were hampered
Meanwhile, recent developments in US inflation and the  Feds  monetary  policy  stance  have  sparked  a  drastic  increase  in  volatility  in  international financial markets
With public and private investment expected to grow faster than last year and private consumption to expand steadily, domestic demand would continue to be the main driving force behind this years economic growth
In addition, compared with recent data of other economies, Taiwans real  housing  price  index  seemed  to  have  a  relatively  lower  annual  growth  rate;  however,  Taiwan ranked higher than most countries in terms of accumulated growth in housing  prices in the past 20 years
Furthermore, several board directors also approved of keeping rates steady, taking into account the trajectory of monetary policies in major economies
The annual growth rate of bank loans and investments averaged 5.70 for the same period as bank lending to private enterprises continued increasing
Firms are building up production capacity with greater investment in machinery and equipment as the global economy strengthens
Based  on  the  assessments  thereof, the Bank may  adjust its  monetary  policy timely and appropriately to fulfill  the statutory duties of maintaining price stability, safeguarding financial stability, and  fostering economic development
For the year as a whole, international institutions expected global economic growth to moderate
Since  the  Board  met  in  December  last  year,  the  coronavirus  COVID-19  pandemic  has  gradually been brought under control, leading to a gradual recovery in global economic and  trade  activities,  coupled  with  an  uptrend  in  international  crude  oil  and  other  commodity  prices
This also showed  that labor market conditions were picking up
Moreover, in recent months, the number of employed persons and the amount  of  overtime  hours  worked  both  continued  decreasing  in  the  manufacturing  sector  but  rose further in the services sector
In light of anticipated slowing in global economic and trade activity this year and a higher base last year, export growth may decelerate in 2019
Current inflationary pressures and expected inflation are both mild
In terms of annual changes in the number of employed persons, the  manufacturing sector posted a further decrease in October while the services sector saw  an  increase
One of these directors pointed out that  upon the June 2023 introduction of this LTV ratio cap, a supplementary policy measure  was  implemented  concurrently  to  exempt  home-movers  within  a  one-year  window  conditional upon signed affidavits
The Banks tightening measures since March amplified the effectiveness of these controls
There  has  been  a  divergence  in  economic  growth  across  major  economies
Firms also expressed optimism about the outlook in the coming six months
Developments  since  the  Board  met  in  December  2022  pointed  to  tepid  growth  momentum  in  advanced  economies,  while  policy  rates  could  stay  high  for  some  time  owing to elevated inflationary pressures
Currently, Taiwans inflation is not much a cause for concern
One board director noted that exports vital role in the economy makes Taiwan  closely interconnected with, and susceptible to, the world economy
In  addition,  housing  market trading had started to slacken since the beginning of the year as a result of the  concerted efforts under the  governments Healthy Real Estate  Market Plan as well as  the pandemics impact; given time, more results of the policy efforts are expected to  show
Another board director stated that M2 continues to serve as an important reference for  monetary policy deliberation
In  this  view,  the  Board  judged  that  a  rate  hold  would  help  sustain  price  and  financial  stability  and  foster  economic growth
The following uncertainties are expected to surround the global economic  and financial outlook 1 The duration of high policy rates adopted by major central  banks, 2 Chinas economic downturn, and 3 global economic fragmentation and  supply chain restructuring, all of which could dampen the momentum for the world  to achieve an economic recovery
Greater final demand benefiting from the gradual normalization of economic activity in major economies was expected to keep Taiwans exports enjoying solid real growth in the second half of 2021, with significant expansion for the year as a whole before moderating next year
The solution would therefore be to guide insurers to invest more in real economic activity
Rising prices for agricultural products and energy items could further exacerbate inflation next year
With  interest  rates  staying  low  for  a  long  while,  speculators  seeking  short-term  gains  and  first-time  homebuyers  wary  of  price  surges scrambled to buy houses, creating a vicious loop that could be exacerbated if low  rates persist longer
Furthermore, the annual growth rate of  construction loans also picked up, reaching 5.0 at the end of August
In addition, the higher-than-usual price rises at home in the  recent year could push up inflation expectations
The policy measures have so far effectively helped banks mitigate  credit  risk  associated  with  real  estate  lending,  reflected  by  steady  slowdown  in  banks construction and housing loan growth and the continuously low level of the  non-performing loan ratio for real estate lending
The  Bank forecasts that Taiwans economy would expand by 4.53 in 2021 Appendix Table 1
Assessed against economic conditions, some of those economies enjoy higher GDP growth than Taiwan while recording a relatively lower negative real interest rate when compared with Taiwan
Based on the estimations of the money demand function, the annual growth rate of M2 demand will remain between 2.5 and 6.5 next year
Meanwhile, although prices of some household paper products hiked to factor in international pulp price movements, and electricity rates are to be raised from April onwards to reflect higher costs of fuel imports for power generation, these factors only made a modest influence on the overall price trend
Despite a recent downtrend  in  the  30-day  commercial  paper  rate,  future  developments  in  the  money  markets  still  require  monitoring
Nonetheless, this does not mean the Bank should write off interest rate policy completely but consider a policy mix of macroprudential measures and interest rate adjustment when warranted
In terms of credit support to help counter the economic impact of the pandemic, there were relief loan programs for both employers and employees implemented by the government
Though the selective credit  controls had proved effective to an extent, they could only treat the symptoms but not the  disease; the housing price malady cannot be cured without a targeted therapy against loose  monetary policy
Considering a slowdown in inflation next year, moderation in economic growth, and already high levels of bank loans and investments, M2 growth is expected to return to the 2.5-6.5 reference range in the second half of 2023
On  the  other  hand,  sources  of  downside  pressures included 1 declines in communication devices prices and communications  rates; 2 the governments potential reduction of tax rates for commodity tax, customs  duty, and business tax, helping to mitigate rising cost pressures for firms
As the domestic pandemic cases diminished, the housing market also witness a  rebound in transaction volume as well as a price rally
One Board Director also noted that the positive effect of the public sector wage increase on private consumption could be offset by a contraction effect as civil servants might tighten their purse strings on concern over reduced income post retirement following the pension reform
In  addition,  the  domestic  economy  is  expected  to  continue expanding at a moderate pace both for the second half o f this year  and  for  next  year,  with  a  modestly  negative  output  gap  for  both  years
In this light, it is advisable to include longer-term factors in the Banks monetary policy decision-making in the future
Although economic expansion remained steady, indicators like the business climate monitor and leading indicators signaled high uncertainties
In view of these risk  concerns and a higher base effect this year 2021, it was expected that major economies would  register slower growth in 2022 compared to 2021
The director  pointed out that the dynamics between some of these factors and inflation trends have changed
In respect of business sentiment, Taiwans leading and coincident indicators for business  cycles recorded consecutive rises in recent months, against a backdrop of the increasing  domestic vaccination rate and gradual easing of containment measures, along with continued  export strength
In this regard, this board director suggested the  Bank consider adjusting the acceptable range for the annual CPI growth rate to a band higher  than 0-2  One board director noted that inflation has different effects on individuals and households  across different income classes because inflation is the most regressive tax of all
Among  major  economies,  growth  was  uneven  The  US  economy  advanced  steadily,  the  euro  area and the UK sputtered, Japan posted mild growth, and China saw greater risk of an  economic slowdown
One board director presented two points of views regarding the future development of domestic economic growth
Nevertheless, considering subdued global inflation expectations, falling oil prices, and soft domestic demand, the CBC forecasts CPI and core CPI inflation for 2017 to rise 1.07 and 1.11 year on year, respectively, reflecting a stable inflation outlook
Therefore, the director supported a 0.125  percentage point rate hike in the hope of containing inflation expectations
Meanwhile, homebuyer sentiment seemed to be dampened recently as the governments  housing  market  policies  gradually  showed  results
Meanwhile, real  estate lending as a percentage of total bank lending had remained stable
Despite the fact that recent NTD weakness was mainly caused by foreign portfolio investment outflows, more downward pressures on the currency could ensue if a wider US-Taiwan interest rate differential induces more capital outflows
Another board director stated that the Bank should closely monitor the changes in the housing market and would better act preemptively before public expectations of home-price rises become palpable
The Banks selective credit control measures, implemented through four amendments since December 2020, have bolstered credit risk management in the banking sector
In terms of labor market conditions, the overall unemployment rate  dropped,  yet  the  number  of  furloughed  employees  in  the  manufacturing  sector  increased
For 2021 as a whole, the Bank  forecasts the CPI and core CPI annual growth rates to be 1.70 and 1.17, respectively  Appendix Table 2
Major  economies  had  begun  reopening  from  the  coronavirus  COVID-19  lockdown  and  continued  with  macro  support  policies,  boosting  consumption  and  investment  demand
One board director stated that maintaining the current policy rate levels would be appropriate, and that policy rate adjustments generally serve two purposes
In addition, as the US Fed and other central banks in  major  economies  began  to  reduce  monetary  policy  accommodation,  the  global  economy this year is expected to grow at a slower pace
While a rate hike is warranted, stronger arguments exist for a 0.25 percentage point hike
Nevertheless,  uncertainties  still  abounded  for  price  trends and economic activity; in the future, the Board could still consider adjusting the  policy rates if deemed necessary
Meanwhile, other economies in Asia either maintained or reduced their policy rates
One board director viewed that maintaining low rates at home should be in order given lingering uncertainties over the global economy
One board director shared that  the Bank noticed a continuous increase in banks  real estate loans with a large balance as a percentage  of total  loans
Meanwhile, the international economic outlook is  confronted  by  many  uncertainties,  the  domestic  output  gap  would  likely  turn  negative,  and  the  domestic  economy  is  projected  to  grow  at  a  slower  pace  than  previously forecasted
Then,  intensifying  conflicts  in  Ukraine  pushed up hedging demand and led the US dollar index to rise sharply and fluctuate at  elevated levels
Regarding  monthly  earnings,  total  nominal  earnings  posted  faster growth, averaging 3.62 for the first four months of the year
On  the  other  hand,  faltering  final  demand  amid  a  slowing  global  economic  expansion  and  the  ensuing  inventory  adjustment  by  some  firms  have  exerted  a  drag  on  Taiwans  export  growth  and  private investment
Therefore,  with  the  aim  of  stemming  an  inordinately  high  flow  of  bank  credit  into the real estate sector and further reining in credit risk of such lending, the Bank decided  to introduce the following amendments Appendix, effective March 19, 2021           1 Lowering the LTV ratio cap on housing loans extended to corporate entities capped  at 40
The Bank managed market liquidity and helped keep bank reserves at an adequate level, and the overnight call loan rate of the banking sector was also steady
In  terms  of  external  demand,  emerging  technology  application  and  traditional  manufacture continued enjoying strong demand, leading exports of major products and  exports  to  major  trading  partners  to  expand  by  more  than  10  for  the  year  to  date
The Bank projected solid export growth for the year as a whole
The pandemic-hit domestically-oriented services sector gradually rebounded, and  labor market conditions steadily resumed the levels before the mid-2021 domestic  COPVID-19 flare-up
In this view, the board director supported the proposed rate hold
One board director pointed out that, given the scale of Taiwans investment in and merchanting trade particularly intermediate goods trade with China over the years since 2000, we are highly integrated into the global value chain
The annual growth rate edged up in August,  though, buoyed by greater demand of government enterprises for funding
For  the year as a whole, the CPI and core CPI inflation rates were forecasted to be 2.22  and 2.44, respectively, lower than last years 2.95 and 2.61
Overall, the Bank forecasted Taiwans economy to expand by 3.22 year on year  in  2024,  higher  than  1.31  of  2023,  based  on  the  expectation  of  exports  and  private  investment  resuming positive  growth  and private  consumption continuing  rising
With  the  fed  funds  rate  expected to stay elevated, major stock markets in the world recorded weaker rallies, the  US dollar index swung high, and major currencies broadly depreciated against the US  dollar
In regard to the key determinants of future price trends, upside pressures could stem from 1 a minimum wage hike implemented early in the year, which would drive up prices in services, and 2 faster rises in food prices including fruit and vegetables, owing to a lower base effect from last years favorable weather conditions
In the foreign  exchange market, the US dollar index trended up as investors expecting a faster rate hike  cycle  of  the  Fed  turned  to  US  dollar  assets
Considering these and a higher base effect in the second half of the year, the pace of the economic recovery may moderate slightly
Growth projections by major institutions ranged between 2.77 and 4.50
Taking  into  account  the  relatively  milder  inflation in Taiwan compared to major economies, and the slower pace of the Feds rate  hike  by  only  0.25  percentage  points  yesterday  March  22,  the  director  supported  the  proposition of raising the policy rates by 0.125 percentage points
Several board directors gave their views about the requirement that land loan borrowers  should commit to begin construction work within a specific time frame
With regard to lending rates, one board director gave the view that whether the lenders are state-owned banks or private ones, the aid efforts were not designed to make them take losses
Since  the  Board  met  in  June  this  year,  the  cumulative  effects  of  significant  policy  rate  hikes  by  major  central  banks  in  the  US  and  Europe  since  2022  have continued to work through the economy
Furthermore, Taiwans nominal and real interest rates were still around the middle range compared to selected economies
Meanwhile,  the  long-term  government  bond  yields  in  major  economies  declined, the US dollar index fell from its peak levels, and major currencies broadly  appreciated against the US dollar
Against this  background, the Board judged that a rate hold would help foster sound economic and  financial development on the whole
As  the M2 annual growth rate had continued to overshoot the reference range this year so far, it  would be important to examine if this also reflected significant growth in bank loans, especially  real estate loans, and to find out if the Banks selective credit controls helped restrain the  expansion of banks real estate lending
The domestic COVID-19 case surge from mid-April slowed private consumption significantly, disrupting recovery in domestically-oriented services
While inflation and expectations are not as severe in Taiwan, exports have contracted for three consecutive months due to slowing global demand and inventory adjustments
In respect  of the electricity tariff hike, it would not only have a direct impact but also create a chain  reaction by pushing up costs across business sectors; for example, electricity-intensive  industries  could  pass  the  increased  bill  costs  to  consumers
Looking ahead, the global economy  faces  multiple downside risks, including the  following 1 Aggressive tightening by major central banks including the Fed and the  ECB,  roiling  global  financial  markets  and  depressing  economic  activity  worldwide,  heightening the risk of defaults by countries with high levels of external debt; 2 the  Russia-Ukraine  war  continuing  on,  taking  a  toll  on  the  European  economy  amid  the  resulting energy crisis and hurting political and economic stability amid financial market  turbulence; 3 Chinas zero-COVID policy posing a threat to the easing of global  supply  chain  bottlenecks,  and  the  real  estate  market  pressures  destabilizing  global  financial stability
This shaped a more acute sense of price rises in  staple items among consumers
Hurricane disruptions to oil production in the Gulf of Mexico in late August, as well as market expectations of a demand rebound as the pandemic eased, pushed international oil prices back upwards
Bank lending rates, including those on adjustable rate mortgages, would change in tandem
However, the Bank should  not be discouraged by the limited results but rather carried on with what should be done
It was projected that global economic growth would  soften  this  year,  with  international  institutions  downgrading  their  forecasts  for  the  worlds GDP growth rate in 2022 and expecting a further slowdown in 2023
Housing transactions in the six Special Municipalities increased moderately in the first eight months compared to the same period last year
Looking  into  the  second  half  of  the  year,  private  consumption  will  likely  continue  with mild growth, while a rebound in global final demand and the ever-brightening  business prospects of emerging tech applications are both expected to buttress export  growth momentum and boost private investment
As  for  the  issue  of  a  negative  real  interest  rate,  if  inflation  is  successfully subdued, the real interest rate would turn positive; in contrast, if inflation  stays elevated, further rate hikes could be warranted
It is also suggested that the Bank communicate to the public that it pays great attention to not only short-term volatility but also longer-term economic growth
While headline inflation trended downwards, key staple goods and core inflation remained elevated, requiring close monitoring of inflation expectations
As the imbalance issue and elevated energy prices  expected to  continue into the first half of 2022  would likely ease afterwards, international institutions  projected a gradual decline of inflation by the end of 2022, with the inflation rate for the year  as a whole to register slightly higher than 2021
Amid expectations of a global economic recovery and  the US governments US1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus package, recent inflation expectations  in  the  US  have  strengthened  markedly,  driving  up  long-term  government  bond  yields  of  major economies, and in turn causing greater volatility in international stock markets
The global manufacturing sector has remained subdued, while the services sector has  softened
Looking ahead, the global economic and financial outlooks are clouded by multiple  uncertainties, such as the cumulative effects of monetary tightening by major central  banks and the duration of interest rates staying high,  Chinas economic  slowdown,  and fragmentation of the global economy, which could all restrain the momentum for  global economic recovery
Looking ahead, downside risks continue to loom over the global economic outlook, including uneven vaccination progress, a greater impact of new virus strains, pressures for some advanced economies to gradually withdraw monetary easing, potential disasters owing to climate change, and heightened geopolitical conflicts
Domestic inflation to come down gradually in the second half of the year, with the  inflation rate slowing to 2 in the fourth quarter    The Bank forecasted the annual growth rates of the CPI and core CPI in 2023 to be  2.24 and 2.38, respectively, lower than last years 2.95 and 2.61
Meanwhile, foreign capital showed a net inflow, the NT dollar appreciated, and Taiwans stock markets rallied
Taiwans real interest rate has reached above zero while many major economies still register negative real interest rates
Meanwhile, active business investment in the emerging applications related to the Internet of Things IoT and cloud services, among others, are also likely to fuel export growth
Monetary tightening measures have led to higher interest rates on bank deposits, loans, and money market instruments
For next  year,  the Bank projected that  a higher base  effect would result in mild real growth in private consumption
Meanwhile, recent concerns about the future courses of US  inflation and the Feds monetary policy have rattled international financial markets
One board director stated that although Taiwans often-watched housing price indices showed a slower rise in the second quarter of this year, a broad uptrend persisted, justifying the adjustment proposition
For the same period, the annual growth rate of  the core CPI averaged 2.66
However, a slowing Chinese economy, lingering world trade protectionism and a higher base effect may combine to restrict export momentum in the second half of the year
One Board Director stated that Taiwans real interest rate, though negative, was still higher than those of the US, Singapore, South Korea, and Hong Kong, while Taiwans 2017 GDP growth projections by forecasting institutions were broadly lower than these economies
In terms of export markets, exports to Taiwans major trading  destinations all recorded positive growth
The board directors decided to raise the discount rate, the rate on refinancing of  secured loans, and the rate on temporary accommodations by 0.125 percentage  points to 2, 2.375, and 4.25, respectively
Nevertheless, the zero interest rate policy of major advanced economies since the 2008 global financial crisis could have unhealthy influences on the economy in general
This concept could be described with the impossible trinity theory
One board director, in favor of both of the propositions, stated that despite steady  economic  growth,  the  National  Development  Councils Monitoring Indicator had in  recent months descended to the lower threshold of the stable signal range, the Leading  Indicators  had  trended  further  downwards,  and  exports  had  also  showed  signs  of  weakening
Against the backdrop of the domestic economic recovery and stable inflation, the CBC has continued to conduct open market operations to manage market liquidity and maintain banks excess reserves at a sufficiently accommodative level
Looking ahead, given lingering uncertainties over the US trade policies toward major economies such as China, the euro area, and Japan, a slowdown in the Chinese economy, and a possible extension of the Brexit deadline, the global economic and financial outlook remains unclear
In  particular,  the  harder-hit  services  sector saw a gradual rebound in wages and this sectors real GDP also resumed growth  thanks  to  improved  domestic  pandemic  situation
The Bank forecasted private consumption growth to gather pace
The rate hike, albeit based on a comprehensive assessment of the overall economic and financial conditions, would be helpful to some parts of the economy while undesirable to others
3 The Banks approach of simultaneously affecting price interest rate and quantity  money stock with hikes in both the policy rates and the RRRs, helping to rein in  domestic inflation expectations    A
Since the Board last met in March, economies where the coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak  came under control such as the US and Europe have gradually relaxed pandemic restrictions  while keeping monetary  and fiscal policy support in place, helping to sustain the upturn in  global economic and trade activity and bolster the prices of crude oil and other commodities
In regard to domestic demand, the Bank expected to see continued real growth in private  investment as domestic and multinational tech firms expanded their local investment plans and  major  government  spending  schemes  including  green  energy  and  5G  network  infrastructure also moved along
Nevertheless,  housing  market  transactions  began  to  climb  back  up  and  housing  prices saw steeper rises in the second half of last year, leading the annual growth rate  of housing loans to trend upwards continuously to 11.0 at the end of August this  year, the highest since May 2006
Services exports, however, were constrained by a sharp decline of inbound visitors as some of the pandemic-related border controls remained in place
In terms of the inflation outlook for the second half of the year, the recent cigarette tax hike may exert upward pressures on prices
In terms of external demand, major export products recorded across-the-board growth  thanks to growing global demand and rising international raw material prices, with the  subcategory of electronics parts and components making the greatest contribution
Looking ahead, cross-border capital movements will likely become a major influence behind Taiwans M2 growth as the global outlook is still shrouded by uncertainties and the U.S. Fed will move ahead with balance sheet reduction and rate hikes
The director emphasized that M2 is a mid- to long-term indicator and suggested allowing more time before adjusting its reference range
From the second half of 2017 to 2018, Taiwans economic growth is likely to advance with mild momentum and to remain lower than potential
In respect of monetary policy moves by major central banks, the US Fed and the  ECB held policy rates steady in the year to date
Since todays increase in policy rates was smaller than the March rate hike and the reserve requirement tool functions indirectly via the bank credit channel, adequate communication to the public about the inflation-fighting effects of todays decisions would be important for the policy to work well in containing inflation expectations
Given the domestic economic expansion under way, it seems the timing is appropriate to  gradually begin monetary policy normalization, which would also help soothe housing price  surges
The  estimates show that the CPI annual growth rates would remain above 2 in the first  three quarters of the year, before slowing to below 2 in the fourth quarter
Another board director noted that projections for investment supported the view that Taiwans economic growth in the second half of the year would outpace that in the first half
The main rationales of the downward revision included 1 both supply-side and demand-side factors resulting in the low global growth trend have not receded, and 2 long-term structural factors will require more time to resolve
In the labor market, the unemployment rate dropped to 4.24 in August, though it remained high
The Bank judged that a positive impetus from domestic demand and a lower base effect would enable Taiwans pace of economic expansion to pick up quarter by quarter in 2019, albeit not as fast as 2018 on a yearly basis
Recently, failures or financial distresses of some banks in the US and Europe had  roiled  international  financial  markets
For the months of September to October, excess reserves  of banks averaged around NT54 billion
In  the  months  since  midyear,  Taiwans  exports  have  recorded  solid  growth,  supported  by  robust  demand  for  artificial  intelligence  and  other  emerging  technology applications
More recently, despite a pickup in  investment growth last year, the pandemic-led decline in consumption also caused saving to  increase faster
Meanwhile,  with  increasing  global  demand  and  lingering  supply  chain  bottlenecks  pushing  up  international  goods  prices,  major economies have witnessed a pronounced uptick in inflation, judged by their central  banks  to  be  transitory
Regarding money supply, the M2 annual growth rate first rose before declining in  the months since February 2024, reflecting a reversal of a net foreign capital inflow into  a net outflow
Nonetheless, the annual M2 growth rate has stayed within the Banks 2.5-6.5 target range in recent years, implying sufficient support for domestic economic activity in normal circumstances
The selective credit controls aimed at mitigating the impact of housing credit on financial stability, rather than targeting housing prices directly
In  Taiwan,  the  impact  was  relatively  mild  because  domestic  banks  have  a  different  balance  sheet  structure  than  those  in  the  US  and  Europe
In principle, the NT dollar exchange rate is determined by market forces
Meanwhile,  some  central  banks  continued  with  monetary  tightening  to  combat  still-high  inflation,  while  some  others  maintained  an  accommodative  stance
Developments since the previous Board meeting in June 2017 showed that the global recovery continued at a solid pace
For  the  year  as  a  whole,  inflation  is  expected  to  rebound as import prices trend up on the back of global price recoveries for oil and other  raw  materials  and  surging  international  freight  charges
Moreover, with the domestic pandemic situation under control,  the government rolled out consumption stimulus measures, leading to an upturn in private  consumption
Therefore, the Board judged that a policy rate hold and a continued accommodative monetary policy stance will help foster sound development of the economy and the financial sector
As  inflationary  pr essures  linger  in  major  economies,  high  interest  rates  may  sustain  for  some  time
Todays new cap tightening  would not only prevent credit flows from being used for property hoarding,  but also help channel those credit towards priority use for home loans to non- homeowners
Under the Facility, financial  institutions have so far approved more than 290 thousand applications with the total  disbursement exceeding NT460 billion, providing the pandemic-hit SMEs with the funds  needed to stay afloat
It was therefore projected that the global economy would  grow  at  a  slower  pace  this  year
Therefore, it would be more appropriate to refrain from unwarranted large rate increases
For the same period, the core CPI posted an average annual growth rate of 2.60
From  the  beginning  of  2022,  despite  Omicron-driven  disruptions  to  the  domestic  economy, consumers largely remained willing to spend, and the retail and  foodbeverage  sectors  registered  growing  sales
Prolonged inflation could raise inflation expectations, necessitating proactive measures
One board director noted that the rate hike proposition was partly based on current  economic  strength,  solid  labor  market  recovery,  and  pressures  from  inflation
Another  board  director  pointed out that in one of the previous amendments to the selective credit controls, the  grace  period  was  removed  for  natural persons second housing loans in the specific  areas but no LTV ratio caps were introduced concurrently
The  resultant  rise  in  the  annual  growth  rate  of  real  estate  lending also caused this loan bracket to maintain a high share in banks total lending
The Board decided unanimously to raise the discount rate, the rate on refinancing of secured loans, and the rate on temporary accommodations to 1.5, 1.875, and 3.75, respectively, effective June 17, 2022
One board director emphasized the importance of monetary policy adjustments in managing inflation expectations
Banks  maintained  positive  about  the  residential  housing  market  outlook,  albeit with less optimism than previously observed
In regard to the size of cuts and future policy space, one board director observed that, limited effects aside, the fact that many central banks cut their policy rates by a large margin  the Feds 1.5 percentage points in particular  gave ground for supporting the proposed 0.25 percentage point reduction
Therefore, the director supported the rate hold  proposition
Several board directors expressed concern about the aforementioned cap tightening  adversely impacting home-movers, and suggested the Bank communicate to the public  about relevant home-mover assistance measures
Board members reached a unanimous decision for the Special SME Accommodation Facility and the policy rate reduction
One  board  director  stated  that  Taiwan  is  currently  facing  greater  price-related  pressures  than  many  other  economies,  mainly  because  of  relatively  smaller  price  increases  in  oil  and  electricity  rates  in  the  past
Since around the middle of the year, domestic private consumption has rebounded  on  the  stabilized  pandemic  situation  at  home
In the housing market, prices of new housing projects and existing homes both rose higher in the second quarter compared to the same period last year, with a more marked price rise in the former type of housing
Being key players in the world, these economies policies  carry  a  weight  on  the  global  economic  and  financial  scenes
The Bank will actively keep track of  the developments in real estate lending and continue to review the implementation  of the selective credit control measures, and make adjustments as needed in order to  promote financial stability
Around  70  of  this  increase  came  from  price  rises  in  food  such  as  food  away  from  home and entertainment services as well as higher rent, with a combined contribution  of 1.72 percentage points
The  producer  price  index  also  extended a decrease by 3.75, indicating receding pressures of imported inflation
As a result, annual growth of banks real estate loans climbed back  up rapidly, leading to a higher loan concentration in real estate loans that came close  to a historical high as of August 2024
period were lower than the same period last year
A board director emphasized that although inflation is expected to drop below 2, inflationary pressures persist, with core inflation above 2 since March
Entering the second half of 2023, though, growth in housing transactions  rebounded and housing prices climbed at a faster pace, driving a continuous rise in  housing loans
For the domestic inflation outlook, however,  the recent Russia-Ukraine conflict and the consequent price surges in global energy  items and other commodities impose considerable imported inflation pressures
One board director pointed out that Taiwans inflationary pressures were in fact much higher than what the actual data showed
Another board director stated that the share  of  real  estate  loans  extended  by  banks  continued  increasing  despite  the  targeted  prudential  measures introduced in December, thus warranting the proposed adjustment
With the pandemic easing and market liquidity in abundance, confidence of homebuilders and homebuyers grew
In the services sector, for  the month of July, the number of employed persons and the amount of overtime hours  worked  both  increased  year  on  year
The  pandemics  impact  on  the  labor  market  has  waned
One Board Director said that although the risk was elevated with the US being the source, investors have generally considered US Treasuries to bear the lowest risk and thus increased their holdings
In this light, the Bank decided to amend the  Regulations Governing the Extension of Mortgage Loans by Financial Institutions  with  the  aim  of  further  strengthening  management  of  bank  credit  resources  and  containing  related  credit  risk
Among central banks in major economies, the US Federal Reserve Fed and the  European Central Bank ECB maintained a restrictive monetary policy stance, with the  Fed pausing in June and the ECB further raising policy rates
After policy rates were raised in September and the RRR increase took effect in October, bank deposit and loan rates trended up, and money market interest rates also climbed
Among the subcategories, construction loans grew relatively faster year on year, mainly because construction firms acquired more land lots to meet potential property demand amid an influx of returning investments by overseas Taiwanese businesses
Though the amended Regulations Governing the Extension of Mortgage Loans by Financial  Institutions  have  brought  down  the  loan-to-value  LTV  ratios  of  those  loans  regulated,  banks have continued witnessing marked increases in real estate lending
Slower growth in exports and capital equipment imports in recent months, as well as limited growth in retail sales, may put a drag on economic growth
The Bank forecasted  solid real export growth in both the second half of 2024 and the year as a whole
Against this background, a rate hold would be appropriate
Against such a background, inflation rates of most major economies  have displayed a drastic downtrend from their peak levels, whereas core inflation rates  have  eased  at  a  mild  pace
International institutions forecasted that the global economy would likely sustain  a steady recovery next year 2022
The domestic inflation rate has declined in the second half of the year but could still register above 2 for the year overall, before dropping below 2 next year
Another board director also commented on the issue of protracted low interest rates
International oil prices are expected to decline, but liquefied natural gas prices remain elevated, and steam coal spot prices exceed contract prices
Overall,  sustained  growth  in  exports  and  private  investment  and  reinvigorating  private consumption were likely to help uphold stable economic growth momentum for  the  year  despite  a  higher  base  effect  and  potential  impact  from  the  Ukraine  war
In  terms  of  the  outlook  for  residential  housing market in major cities, banks showed slightly less optimism about some areas and were  continuously upbeat about some other areas
The clearer, the firmer, and the sooner an effective monetary policy is introduced, the more likely it will be to well anchor inflation expectations early on and to ward off the risk of an economic recession
The Bank trims its forecast for the economic growth this year  to 3.51 Appendix Table 1
Given mounting pressures of imported inflation fueled by rising international commodity prices, domestic inflation is expected to remain elevated
Since the beginning of this year, softened external demand has contributed to negative growth in exports and weighed on production activity
The director, expressing support for todays policy propositions, added that the reserve requirement tool influences through the stock of money
Another Board Director gave the opinion that monetary policy alone cannot overcome the issue of stagnant investment; it is vital that monetary policy be accompanied by other measures, such as those alleviating shortages of electricity and water
Major institutions at home and abroad expected Taiwans economy to grow by  2.69-3.70 in 2024
Several board directors shared their views on the  content of this adjustment
Export growth is likely to benefit from a firming global economy next year
By product groups, most of the leading groups registered negative growth, except for information, communications  audio-video products, and electrical machinery products
Looking  ahead,  the  global  economic  and  financial  outlooks  are  still  shrouded  in  many uncertainties, such as the duration of policy rates of major economies staying  high, the degree of tightening of global financial conditions, the pace of Chinas  economic recovery, geopolitical risks, and climate change
In the year to date, liquidity in the banking system has been abundant, overnight call loan rates have remained steady, and the 10-year government bond yield has moved within a narrow range
Continued adjustments, as seen needed, of the tariff reduction measures, including  commodity taxes on gasoline, diesel, and cement, and tariffs on beef, formula milk,  butter, and wheat; an extension of business tax exemption on imported soybeans,  wheat, and corns
The extent to which electricity and gas pricing reflects true costs will have significant implications for monetary policymaking
The Bank expected inflation to still run above  2 in the first three quarters this year before sliding below 2 in the fourth quarter
This could explain why the Banks selective credit controls have not been distinctly effective in curbing housing price gains
At the Meeting today, the Board decided unanimously to keep the discount rate, the rate on  refinancing  of  secured  loans,  and  the  rate  on  temporary  accommodations  unchanged  at  1.125, 1.5, and 3.375, respectively
It is estimated that nearly 20 of housing loan applications belong to people  who seek new home loans despite already owning residential properties
Looking ahead, the global economy faces several downside risks 1 the Ukraine war exacerbating supply chain disruptions and the global food crisis; 2 elevated inflation amplifying inflation expectations and adding to price pressures; 3 faster rate hikes worsening financial conditions and dampening global economic growth; 4 Chinas economic slowdown dragging down global growth
Policy Proposition To keep the discount rate, the rate on refinancing of secured loans, and the rate on temporary accommodations unchanged at 1.125, 1.5, and 3.375, respectively; to adjust the Banks selective credit control measures
By contrast, efforts to rein in  high inflation had proved effective, and the Bank forecasted Taiwans inflation rate this  year to drop below last years 2.95, along with a further decline to less than 2 next  year
Our economic growth would pick up in the latter half of this year and continue to expand moderately next year with exports strengthening and domestic demand reinvigorated as the domestic COVID-19 situation remains under control
Since the Board met in June this year, growth in the US, the euro area, and China  has moderated, prices of commodities such as international crude oil have trended  downward,  and  global  supply  chain  bottlenecks  have  gradually  eased,  whereas  global inflation remains at high levels
Looking at the coming quarters, with the supply chain inventory drawdown nearing the  end,  AI-related  business  booming,  new  tech  products  hitting  the  market,  and  orders  rising for the high season, it was expected that growth in exports would see a smaller  decline in only single digits for the third quarter of 2023 and would turn positive in the  fourth quarter, albeit still in negative territory for the year as a whole
2 The present uptick in inflation is judged to be transitory and inflation is expected to be mild this  year
Regarding private consumption, domestic COVID-19  containment policy was eased, government measures to boost consumption were launched, and  business in the services industry  a domestically oriented sector  gradually rebounded
The  annual growth rate  of the CPI has stayed over  2 for consecutive  months and will  likely remain so towards the third quarter of the year, while that of the core CPI has  also increased, both pointing to a persistent trend of elevated inflation
Looking ahead, upside pressures for domestic prices could arise from 1  downward price stickiness i.e., easy  to rise but hard to fall in some items of the  services category, including food away from home and residential rent; 2 the easing of  border controls leading to hikes in airfares and travel group fees; 3 greater demand for  domestic travel as concerns over pandemic waves diminished, and the resulting rise in  prices for hotels and accommodation; 4 the planned hike of minimum wages next year
b Recent data pointed to an increase in natural persons second housing loans in terms  of the borrower number and as a share of total According to the Joint Credit  Information Center, in the first quarter of the year, the number of newly-extended  second housing loans taken out by natural persons increased and its share as a  percentage of total borrowers of newly-extended housing loans also rose from  12.6 in the previous quarter to 15.2
2    In 2024, the domestic economy is expected to witness a negative output gap, and a  slowing global economy facing many risks to its outlook could further weigh on the  domestic economic recovery
International institutions project the world economy to contract sharply this year and resume growth next year, albeit still below the pre-pandemic level
For the first four months of the year, the M2 annual growth rate averaged  5.81,  within  the  2.5-6.5  reference  range  but  slightly  higher  than  5.44  of  the  fourth quarter last year
Looking ahead, the global economic outlook is confronted by many uncertainties,  as  these  factors,  including  monetary  policy  paths  of  major  central  banks  such  as  the  timing  of  a  Fed  or  ECB  pivot  to  easing,  developments  after  the  BoJ  ended  negative  interest rate policy, etc
Compared to the end of last year, the level of concentration of real estate lending increased slightly as of the end of July
As a result, consumer spending slumped, and the recovery of domestically-oriented services sectors faltered
International commodity prices, including crude oil, have mostly declined, alleviating global inflationary pressures
Combined with the growth-dampening effect of a warm winter at the start of the year, food prices are likely to pick up
Borrowers would also be required to commit  to begin construction within a specific time frame, a rule aiming at urging them to begin  building work sooner so as to increase housing supply and prevent undue financing for  land hoarding
In addition, the non-performing loan ratios of these two loan brackets stayed  low, indicating good credit quality
The impact on workers pay could further weigh on private spending
The proposed actions at todays meeting was a  policy  mix  of  two  quantity-related  tools  by  adjusting  the  selective  credit  control  measures alongside an RRR hike
Board  members  reached  a  unanimous  decision  to  raise  the  policy  rates  by  0.125  percentage points
In regard to housing market-related measures, the Banks four recent rounds of selective credit controls were in fact financial stability measures introduced to avoid an inordinate credit flow into the real estate sector, instead of attempts aiming directly at housing prices
With global goods demand cooling off, the European energy crunch thawing on a  warm  winter,  and  China  lifting  pandemic  lockdown  measures,  concerns  about  goods  supply disruptions also eased, global supply chain pressures fell to pre-pandemic levels  and container freight rates dropped significantly
Given that Taiwans CPI annual growth rate has come close to or exceeded 2 for four  consecutive years, the inflation expectation problem should be heeded
This director expressed concern that the Board did not take action against the housing price issue in the March meeting, neither did it in todays meeting
Second, the seemingly robust  export expansion this year was partially attributable to some sectors emerging from the previous  years contraction thanks to a lower base effect
As for next year, most of them are expected to grow at a slightly slower or similar pace, except for the U.S. where the economy is projected to strengthen further
The director viewed that the effect of a 25 bps hike  was less about dampening housing prices than about sending a message
The Bank of Japan BoJ embarked on  policy normalization with a rate hike this week, ending the negative interest rate policy  and  abolishing  yield  curve  control  while  maintaining  a  loose  monetary  policy  stance
The annual growth rate of M2 measured on a daily average  basis decreased from 7.25 in the fourth quarter of 2022 to an average of 6.69  in  the  first  four  months  of  2023
Therefore,  the Bank will continue reviewing the status of banks real estate lending and  the  effectiveness  of  the  selective  credit  controls,  closely  monitor  potential  impacts  of  real  estate  sector-related  policies  on  the  housing  market,  and  adjust relevant measures as needed in order to promote financial stability and  sound banking operations
In respect of money supply, owing to the economic slowdown and weaker annual  growth  in  bank  loans  and  investments  so  far  this  year,  the  annual  growth  rate  of  the  monetary aggregate M2, measured on a daily average basis, decreased to 6.44 during  the Jan.-Oct. period from the 7.54 recorded in the same period last year, still within  the reference range of 2.5-6.5
Another board director pointed out that during the global financial crisis the Bank held six meetings during the four months of September through December instead of just the two scheduled quarterly meetings
Another Board Director pointed out that, although rising stock prices helped to mitigate a tightening in financial conditions, the wealth effect of stock rallies mainly benefited foreign investors, who collectively hold about 40 of the shares listed on Taiwans stock markets
In  respect  of  private  investment,  an  improving  outlook  for  goods  exports  would  likely drive private investment in 2024
The domestic economy is on track to solid growth this year, likely expanding by 4.53  according to the Banks forecast
For this year, the Bank forecast the CPI and core CPI annual growth rates to be 0.91 and 0.78, respectively
Therefore, this director considered it to be the right move to keep related regulations in place
Nevertheless, there remain downside risks such as the  spread of the new virus variants and lingering supply chain bottlenecks
For the year as a whole, international institutions projected oil prices to be higher  than the previous  year
Another Board Director expressed a similar view that, in the context of a gradual recovery next year and insufficient momentum for private consumption and investment, it is even more important to maintain a stable financial environment while the government is pressing ahead with expansionary fiscal stimulation
As of October 2022, annual growth rates of real estate lending, housing loans, and construction loans edged down to 8.6, 7.6, and 12.18, respectively
Meanwhile, as minimum  wage  and  public  sector  pay  were  scheduled  to  be  raised  next  year,  private  consumption is expected to enjoy further growth
Meanwhile,  the  construction  loan  ratio  of  domestic  banks was 27.05, still below the 30 cap prescribed in Article 72-2 of the Banking  Act.2  The ratio of non-performing housing loans extended by domestic banks remained  low at 0.08
The Bank forecasted inflation and core inflation rates for 2022 at 2.93 and 2.59, respectively
A rate cut would indicate the Banks stance on easing and a commitment to ensure ample market liquidity
With government helping banks to help businesses, it showed the importance of the corporate sector
The data also showed that the average LTV ratio of this loan bracket had stayed  high since July 2023
The NT dollar has strengthened against the US dollar, but the real effective exchange rate REER index of the NT dollar trended down as major currencies appreciated more markedly against the US dollar
The director expressed  support for a rate hold today, but noted that by the time the next quarterly Board Meeting  is  convened,  the  Bank  should  pay  special  attention  to  price  uptrends  and  to  whether  consumer  sentiment  about  prices  would  step  up  inflation  expectations  and  create  an  impact on price stability
Policy Propositions To raise the discount rate, the rate on refinancing of secured  loans, and the rate on temporary accommodations by 0.125 percentage points to  1.625, 2, and 3.875, respectively; and to increase the reserve requirement  ratios  on  NT  dollar  demand  deposits  and  time  savings  deposits  by  0.25  percentage points, respectively
Domestic  market  liquidity  was  ample  and  short  and  long -term  market  rates  fluctuated  within  a  small  range  in  recent  months
The proposition to restrict the  LTV ratios of this loan bracket seemed to aim at the concern that excessive lending to  the  real  estate  sector  could  undermine  banks risk control
The  Feds aggressive hikes came with a worrying economic outlook; if the U.S. economy  has  a  hard  landing,  then  Taiwan  could,  in  the  following  six  months,  sustain  injury  in  many  aspects  including  investment,  consumption,  and  exports,  a  consideration  that  warranted the directors support for a 0.125 percentage point rate hike
Another board director pointed to the complex international economic and financial  conditions recently
Overall, the pace of disinflation remained slow
As of the end of April, the average annual growth rate of home loans extended  by  banks  rose  modestly  while  that  of  construction  loans  declined  further,  and  their  non- performing ratios stayed low
The non-performing loan NPL ratio of home-purchase loans of domestic banks stood at 0.15 in July, lower than the NPL ratio of all loans, which was 0.25
From the beginning of 2022, domestic prices of food and oil-related products were pushed up by rising import costs, and domestic harvests of fruit and vegetables were restrained by unfavorable weather conditions, leading the consumer price index CPI annual growth rate to trend upwards
By contrast, serious  debates and rigorous research on inflation are somewhat insufficient in Taiwan
The growth projections made by major forecasting institutions for Taiwan this year ranged between 1.05 and 2.37
In  January  and  February  this  year,  the  inflation  rate  fluctuated  more  markedly  owing to the Lunar New Year holidays
The Banks survey on  investment trust companies revealed a significant increase in the number of respondents expecting  the  CPI  inflation  rate  to  exceed  1  in  the  following  12  months,  indicating  higher  inflation  expectations
According to the Banks forecast, this years economic growth rate will be a moderate 2.58, slightly lower than last years 2.86
Looking ahead, the global economy is still clouded by multiple downside risks, mainly including the Russia-Ukraine conflict, inflation expectations likely being pushed up by high global inflation, a slowdown in Chinas economic growth, and tightening international financial conditions, which could weigh on global production as well as economic and trade activity
Price trends of international commodities and domestic services as well as  weather events are among the possible factors affecting Taiwans inflation this year
In  addition, the estimation of the money demand function showed that the growth rate of demand  for M2 is likely to range between 2.5 and 6.5 next year, consistent with the reference range  used by the Bank
In the four quarter of 2020, the number and  amount of high-value housing increased by 17.57 and 23.92 year on year, respectively
In respect of external demand, a slow global economic recovery caused Taiwans  exports to shrink by 11.5 during the first eleven months of the year; all major product  categories recorded negative growth, except for ICTAV information, communication  and technology, and audio-visual products thanks to demand for AI and other emerging  technology  applications
Since  the beginning of  this year,  the U.S.,  Europe, and  some  Asia-Pacific  economies had aggressively raised their policy rates to tame relatively higher  inflationary pressures
Meanwhile, international institutions expected that global inflation and inflation in most economies would be weaker than last year, citing a sluggish global economic prospect and a projected downtrend in international oil prices
Looking  ahead,  global  economic  prospects  face  many  downside  risks,  including  the cumulative effect of major central banks tightening and the duration for the policy  rates to stay elevated, greater risk for the Chinese economic slowdown to worsen, and  fragmentation in the world economy, all of which could weigh on the momentum of the  global  economic  recovery
In  the  second  half  of  the  year,  despite still sluggish investment activity, economic growth was expected to rebound by  3.84, with exports gaining traction as a result of global supply chain destocking and  domestic demand buttressed by steady private consumption growth and the  governments tax  surplus  rebates
The Bank will also stay attentive to incoming information  regarding  monetary  policy  paths  of  major  central  banks,  risks  from  Chinas  economic  downturn,  international  raw  material  prices,  geopolitical  risks,  extreme  weather,  etc
In terms of the inflation outlook, considering the adverse impact on domestic consumption demand caused by the spread of the virus, combined with plunging international oil and raw material prices, the Bank trims the forecasts of the CPI and core CPI annual growth rates for 2020 to 0.59 and 0.55, respectively Appendix Table 2
In respect of domestic demand, private  consumption recorded solid growth thanks to resurging post -pandemic  demand  for  domestic  travel  and  dining,  but  private  investment  remained  sluggish  as  capital  equipment  imports  still  exhibited  negative  growth
In addition, the Bank estimated that Taiwan would have a negative output gap in  2024
Likewise, downward  price stickiness  of  food away from home  also warrants attention as its annual growth  rate has stayed elevated, and a faster hike in food-away-from-home prices could make  it harder for inflation pressures to ease anytime soon
For  the  outlook  of  this  year,  the  CPI  inflation  rate  would  likely  slow  down  from  last  year  given  a  mild  rise  in  commodity  prices,  as  international  oil  prices were  projected  by international institutions  to  edge up  from  the  previous year, and a smaller increase in services prices owing to a high base  effect
Currently, the only restriction imposed on the newly- extended second housing loans for homes in the specific areas was the prohibition of a grace period during which borrowers pay just the interest but not the principal  and some banks appeared to have applied looser mortgage underwriting standards  compared to other banks
One board director remarked that the persistent easy money conditions in Taiwan is related  to ample market liquidity amid a saving glut and investment deficiency
Short-term market interest rates climbed higher in September 2023, reflecting end- of-quarter funding needs, the Mid-Autumn Festival long-weekend holiday, provisional  payments of profit-seeking enterprise income tax, and continued net selling and outward  remittances by foreign institutional investors
Among major economies, growth in the US economy is expected to accelerate, the euro area continues to exhibit robust growth, while Japan and China are likely to expand at a slower pace
Global recovery is steadily on track, but uncertainties remain
Major institutions at home and abroad projected Taiwans economy  to grow by 0.77-2.00 in 2023 and by 2.30-3.40 in 2024
Overall, the current inflation upswing is viewed to be transitory and inflation is expected to  be mild for this year as a whole, with next years inflation outlook tilting to the downside
Factors likely  to  influence  the  future  path  of  domestic  inflation  include  price  trends  of  international  commodities and domestic services, as well as weather conditions
As a result, 10-year government bond yields of  the US, Japan, and Germany were all on the rise
In terms of participants, one board director pointed to an inspiring sense of unity in Taiwan during the 2008 global financial crisis, when the government helped banks, banks helped businesses, and businesses helped workers  the kind of inspiration that should be re-created by the banking sector in the current crisis to turn the tide
As a result, it is expected that growth momentum for the global economy is likely to soften this year
International  institutions  trimmed  down  the  global  economic growth forecast for this  year and revised up their projections for global  inflation
Market attention to major  central banks monetary policy moves has induced greater volatility in international  financial markets
Private investment also exhibits brighter prospects
The  Bank  will  take  these  into  account  in  assessing  the  implications  for  domestic  economic  and  financial  conditions  and  adjust  its  monetary  policy  in  a  timely  manner  as  warranted,  so  as  to  fulfill  the  statutory duties of maintaining financial and price stability and fostering economic  development within the scope of the above objectives
The Banks 2024 inflation projections were revised upwards on account of the  planned electricity tariff hike in April
In addition to this Facility, as part of the governments continued efforts to urge state-owned banks to give full support for SMEs, other central agencies introduced SME aid programs that could also expect keen cooperation from state-owned banks
For  next  year,  it was expected Taiwans exports would be  buoyed up by stronger world trade growth than this year, booming demand for emerging   technology  applications,  and  consumers sustained  appetite  for  cross-border  travel
Therefore,  the  member  supported  a  rate  hike  by  0.125  percentage  points
Another  board  director  noted  that  current  international  financial  conditions  have  faced  increasingly  higher  uncertainties  than  before;  a  similar  situation  would  lead  to  different assessments in different times, hence the difference in the size of policy rate  adjustments
This was mainly because Taiwan has broadly kept the pandemic situation under  control and has experienced little supply chain bottlenecks such as logistics problems, and  the domestic labor market did not face capacity constraints and recorded mild growth in  average non-farm employee earnings
In the international financial markets, equity price volatility intensified at the beginning of the year but abated after mid-February, while VIX the widely-followed measure of expected volatility also dropped then and moved within a narrower range
Banks  excess  reserves  averaged  slightly  above  NT45  billion  for  the  three  months  from June to August
Amid the evolving pandemic, the Bank paid close attention to credit conditions of small and medium-sized enterprises
On the other hand, imported inflationary pressures would be held down by lower international oil prices projected for this year
Moreover,  the  average  real  annual  growth  rates  of  total  employee  earnings  turned  negative  for  the  January-April  period  of  the  year,  the  first  negative  growth  in  seven  years,  warranting  continued attention to the potential impact of prices on real total earnings growth
In  the  domestic  financial  system,  liquidity  remained  ample,  and  banks  excess  reserves  stayed  above  NT50  billion  recently
In  respect  of  external  demand,  sluggish  global  final  demand,  ongoing  inventory  adjustments, and a higher base effect combined to drag Taiwans exports down by  16.9 year on year for the first five months of 2023
The overnight call loan rate has also been steady
Meanwhile, housing price rises continued but at a slower pace
Should  these  uncertainties  and  risks  materialize  andor intensify, they could weigh down the global economic recovery
Another board director stated that there are three types of interest rate decisions, a rate cut, a rate hold, and a rate hike
For the first two months of the year, the annual CPI growth rate averaged 2.60,  reflecting price rises in fuel and lubricant products, food away from home, fruit, durable  consumer  goods,  and  transportation  with  a  combined  contribution  of  1.57  percentage  points to the increase
For the outlook of next year, as continuous expansion in the global economy and  trade were expected to bolster Taiwans exports and private investment, coupled with  continuous private consumption growth, the Bank forecasted the economy to expand by  3.08  in  2025
Surging  energy  and  food  prices  have  kept  inflation  in  major  economies  at  high  levels  this  year  so  far
The annual CPI growth rate stood at 2.35 in November, while the core CPI annual growth rate, excluding fruit, vegetables, and energy items, remained high at 2.86
One board director stated the current domestic downturn was partly due to a higher  base effect arising from robust economic growth in the past three  years,  while  global  inflation also took its toll on our economy
In particular, it needs to be determined if the significant increase in net ETF assets in the interim affected M2 growth adversely
The  Bank  therefore  slightly  upgraded  the  forecast for Taiwans 2024 GDP growth rate to 3.22 see Appendix Table 1  for the forecasts by major institutions, which was higher than 1.31 in 2023
With the spread of the coronavirus, the global economy is expected to expand at a notably slower pace this year, which may undermine Taiwans exports
Developments since the Board met in June 2023 showed a slow recovery in global  final demand owing to the cumulative effect of aggressive tightening by major central  banks  in  the  US  and  Europe
A reference survey the Bank conducted on investment trust companies revealed  an increased share of those respondents expecting domestic prices to slightly turn upwards, and  the expectation pointed to a mild inflation
Given the decline in international raw material prices and a higher base effect, the  annual CPI growth rate was expected to gradually come down from the third quarter of  the year onwards
The annual growth rate of the CPI was 1.97 in 2021, 2.95 in 2022, and 2.49  in 2023 and is projected by the Bank to be 2.16 in 2024
The Bank forecasted that the annual growth rates of the  CPI  and  the  core  CPI  would  register  2.46  and  2.56  in  2023,  lower  than  2.95 and  2.61  in  2022 see  Appendix  Table 2 for the forecasts by  major  institutions
Related discussions are summarized as follows
The average core CPI annual growth rate excluding fruit, vegetables, and energy prices for the same period was 0.97
Exports are projected to expand at a slower pace next year
The amended Regulations  Governing  the  Extension  of  Mortgage  Loans  by  Financial  Institutions the Regulations took effect on December 8, 2020, a policy move in line with  the aims of efficient allocation and proper use of credit resources in the governments  Program to Foster a Sound Real Estate Market. So far, the LTV ratios of the loans  governed by the Regulations have dropped and the interest rates thereof have risen, but  there remains a substantial increase in banks real estate lending
The median of domestic institutions CPI forecasts is 1.18 and that of international institutions forecasts is 1.30
For the first five months of the year, the average CPI annual growth rate was 0.60, mainly because a slump in vegetable prices mostly offset the increases in fuel and fruit prices
One board director noted that the key considerations for the Banks monetary policy  conduct may also include housing price trends in addition to inflation and economic growth
In addition, second  housing loans taken out by natural persons  increased both in terms of the number of borrowers and as a share of total borrowers of  newly-extended  housing  loans
Key drivers contributing to the  rise included rising food prices such as food away from home and fruit, higher housing  rent, and prices rises for personal effects and entertainment services, with a combined  contribution of 1.51 percentage points, or 67, to the rise in the CPI annual growth rate
Meanwhile, the RJ CRB index,  a global commodities benchmark, was dragged down by the oil price slump
Private  consumption would also continue expanding next year thanks to the planned  minimal  wage  hike  and  public  sector  pay  raise,  albeit  with  slower  year -on- year  growth  than  2023  owing  to  a  higher  base  effect
Financially strapped SMEs could even be forced to close down
While nominal regular earnings of all payroll employees in the  industrial  and  services  sectors  posted  the  highest  annual  growth  rate  since  2000,  real  regular earnings adjusted for inflation actually slipped to negative growth
The biggest contribution came from increased exports of electronic parts and components thanks to solid global demand for semiconductors
At this juncture,  the  Banks  strong commitment to rein in inflation would help lower inflation  expectations
To promote financial stability, reinforce banks credit risk management associated with real  estate lending, and curb inordinate flows of credit resources towards the property market,  the Bank amended the _Regulations Governing the Extension of Mortgage Loans by  Financial Institutions hereinafter the Regulations or Mortgage Loan Regulations  three times from December 2020
In the future, the Bank will monitor the policy changes of other central banks  and the developments in international economic and financial conditions to advise quarterly  reviews and respond as warranted
In terms of bank credit, the annual growth rate of bank loans and investments turned  to a downtrend after December 2022 as exports contracted, mortgage growth declined  year on year, and bank investments shrank further
Nonetheless, major  companies remained cautious in devising investment strategies given the uncertainties  about  the  global  economic  outlook
On another front, Japan has adopted low policy rates for a long time but could still be slipping into the lost 30 years. While monetary policy such as the BoJs balance sheet expansion and fiscal policy such as increased government spending could be used to counter short-term economic cycles, they are not the effective cure for long-term structural diseases, which have been ailing Japan
In this view, private consumption will likely record modest growth this year and grow slightly further next year
Meanwhile,  raising the RRRs by 0.25 percentage points was to require banks to increase the reserves  they already retain and the impact on banking operations should be limited
2 Financial conditions    Domestic long and short-term interest rates went upwards as the Banks hikes in  policy  rates  and  the  reserve  requirement  ratios  RRRs  took  effect  in  June  and  July,  respectively
The Bank forecasted the CPI and  core CPI inflation rates to further decrease from 2.46 and 2.56 in 2023 to 1.89 and  1.83 in 2024, respectively
The board directors decided unanimously to keep the discount rate, the rate on  refinancing  of  secured  loans,  and  the  rate  on  temporary  accommodations  unchanged at 2, 2.375, and 4.25, respectively, to adjust the selective credit  control  measures,  and  to  raise  the  reserve  requirement  ratios  on  NT  dollar  deposits by 0.25 percentage points
Another board director supported the 0.125 percentage point hike and remarked on  the inflation rate
The construction loan  ratio of domestic banks was 26.84 at the end of October 2021, below the 30 cap prescribed  in Article 72-2 of the Banking Act
Since current  economic  readings  were  divergent,  the  director  approved  of  a  rate  hold  for  the  time  being, and noted that continued  monitoring was warranted  for another quarter, with  a  possibility of having to proactively address the issue of inflation
However,  banks  real  estate  lending  continued  to  increase  markedly
Overall, the Bank revised the forecast for this years GDP growth rate slightly upward to 1.60 based on brighter prospects for growth in fixed investment and exports compared to the previous June forecast
In the financial markets, from April 2024 onwards, continuous strength in the US  labor  market and sluggish disinflation bolstered market expectation for a Fed  rate cut  delay,  leading  to  high-level  fluctuations  of  the  US  government  bond  yields
The Bank forecasts this years GDP growth rate to be 2.13, higher than last years 1.48
In the financial markets, US and German government bonds yield curves inverted  owing to recent market expectations about the Fed and the ECB keeping policy rates at  high levels for a considerable time, along with concerns that the cumulative effects of  monetary  tightening  could  suppress  future  economic  growth
Nevertheless,  the  lifting  of  pandemic-related  restrictions  in  most  countries  has  supported a rebound in the services sector
Recent concerns over the turbulence in the banking sectors of the US and Europe  and the ensuing effects on market expectations about the size of rate hikes by major  central  banks  have  heightened  volatility  in  international  financial  markets
However, among construction loans, those taken out for land purchases continued to grow fast,  expanding by 24.1 year on year
Citing the recent uptrend in construction-related financing, one of the board directors  expressed support for the adjustment to reduce the LTV caps to as low as 40, stating that the  timely tightening of selective credit controls would help restrain property speculation
The Bank has made four adjustments to its selective credit control measures since  December 2020
For the first five months of the year, the annual growth rates of the CPI and core CPI excluding fruit, vegetables, and energy items averaged 3.04 and 2.33, respectively
Policy efforts from the Ministry of the Interior, Ministry of Finance, Financial Supervisory Commission, and local governments under the Healthy Housing Market Plan are expected to show results over time
Therefore, the Bank expected to see private investment register  solid  real  growth  this  year
The Bank revises its GDP growth forecast downward to 2.21 in 2023 Appendix  Table 1, a pace slower than the 2.45 in 2022
Looking at different categories of the CPI basket, prices of goods declined recently  while prices of services, which tend to be sticky e.g., easy to increase but slow to  decrease,  continued  to  trend  upwards
The global economic outlook remains shrouded in numerous uncertainties
In addition, housing  market transactions have been dampened somewhat in the year to date as a result of  the governments cross-agency efforts under the Healthy  Real Estate Market Plan and the pandemic flare-up in recent months
Looking ahead, the global economy faces multiple downside risks synchronized monetary policy tightening could deepen the global economic slowdown and undermine financial stability; implications from US-China disputes could hamper the process of globalization; geopolitical risks could disrupt supply chain networks; the Russia-Ukraine war and the ensuing energy crisis in Europe could add to global economic headwinds; and extreme weather events and energy transition efforts could both be inflationary
In China, a surge in COVID-19 cases and inventory destocking sharply impacted corporate sales
The overall monitoring indicator flashed a yellow-blue transitional between stable and sluggish signal
The average annual growth rate of bank loans and investments was 4.45 for the first two months of the year, higher than the sum of the 2018 projected GDP and CPI annual growth rates 3.85, which indicates sufficient supply in the credit market
All board directors expressed support for the policy rate reduction and the introduction of the Special SME Accommodation Facility
Showing the effectiveness of the Banks monetary policy instruments in  guiding market interest rates, most of the money market rates and banks depositlending  rates had sufficiently risen in reflection of the Banks policy rate increases
Another board director agreed with todays propositions and stated that the considerations supporting the policy rate increase by only 12.5 basis pointsincluding financial conditions having tightened, economic activity likely slackening off, relief loan programs closing leaving the respective loan rates at the discretion of banks, and domestic demand recovery sputtering e.g., domestically-oriented services sector posting negative real earnings growthwere understandable
These risks, should they materialize, could hinder global economic growth  and jeopardize financial stability
For  the  first  two  months  of  the  year,  the  average  bank  excess reserves  was  slightly above NT60 billion
One  board  director  remarked  that  the  previous  series  of  selective  credit  controls  were indeed introduced with the aim of a healthy housing market; in the meantime, the  Bank continued monitoring banks loan portfolio to curb an inordinate flow of capital  into the real estate sector
According to international institutions, this years oil  prices would be lower than 2022 but would rebound slightly next year
Against the backdrop of intense inflationary pressures and significant downside risks faced by the global economy, the Bank will closely monitor implications for domestic price trends resulting from the Russia-Ukraine conflict and other geopolitical risks, international commodity price movements, and the global pandemic progress
Another board director pointed out that the recent US rate hike will be followed by further gradual increases, and the euro area and Japan will also raise rates albeit at a slower pace; given the current economic and financial conditions, it will serve Taiwan well to stay put
As manufacturing activity and trade gradually picked up, global economic growth is expected to rebound from the low level of last year
Meanwhile, the non-performing ratios of banks housing loans and construction loans  both remained low, indicating sound credit quality
For  the  first  eleven  months  of  the  year, the annual growth rate of the CPI averaged 2.48 and that of the core  CPI averaged 2.60
International  institutions  forecasted  that,  for  this  year,  oil  prices  would  trend  slightly lower than last year and drop further next year
Moreover, as the  domestic market already had ample liquidity, raising the policy rates could attract capital  inflows and further buoy up liquidity
In addition, despite some signs of cooling in housing transactions  and slower price rises, the uptrend in housing prices still continued; given that residential  rent serves as a lagging indicator of housing prices and has a significant weighting in  the CPI basket, rises in rent could in turn drive up overall prices
In all, these  factors would mean there is little room for a rate hike
With this potential positive effect on private consumption, next years GDP growth projection is likely to be revised up
Regarding  money  supply,  the  daily  average  annual  growth  rate  of  the  monetary  aggregate  M2 dropped from 7.48 in 2022 to 6.25 in 2023, returning  to  the 2.5- 6.5  reference  range
Although the headline and  core  inflation  rates  were  edging  downwards,  their  average  values  for  the  first  five  months  of  2023  were  still  higher  than  those  of  the  previous  ten  years
One supervisor stated that according to the DGBAS, who is responsible for CPI  statistics compilation in Taiwan, residential rent has a weight of about 15, while the  U.S. assigns a higher weight to rent above 30 and the sample of housing units are  for urban U.S. Across many countries, data show that housing prices have posted larger  increases than rents
Two board directors gave opinion on the fact that M2 growth had exceeded the upper end  of the reference range
A 70 LTV ratio cap was thus to be introduced for the  second housing loans taken out by natural persons for homes in the specific areas  so as to strengthen real estate-related credit risk management
All primary export categories posted negative growth,  except  for  ICTAV  information,  communication  and  technology,  and  audio-visual  products  as  they  were  buttressed  by  demand  for  AI  and  other  emerging  technology  applications
The Bank has made five amendments to its selective credit control measures since  December 2020, which have helped banks mitigate risks associated with real estate  lending
One board director noted that, in addition to closely following the changes in the Feds  policy, the Bank should also monitor the effect of domestic consumers inflation expectations  and the future price trends and put them into proper consideration in the next quarterly meeting  and adjust the monetary policy timely as warranted
On  balance,  the  Bank  expected  real  private  investment to resume modest positive growth in 2024
The  Bank expected Taiwans economic growth to accelerate in the second half of the  year  compared  to  the  previous  half
Household inflation expectations might capture the tipping point of structural changes in inflation
The  Board  thus  decided  to  raise  the  reserve  requirement  ratios  on  NT  dollar  passbook  and  time  savings  deposits  by  0.25  percentage points, effective July 1, 2024 Appendix 2
These could drive up domestic prices for energy,  food,  and  durable  consumer  goods,  thereby  stoking  inflationary  pressures
Domestic short-term interest rates were broadly stable
Domestic growth momentum could weaken slightly; actual output is below potential  Exports might grow a little more slowly because of a higher base effect, whereas domestic demand will be the key driving force of economic growth given a rebound in private investment and steady private consumption growth
In  the  labor  market,  the  number  of  employed persons continued increasing in recent months, the unemployment  rate registered lower than that  in the same period last year, and total nominal  earnings posted mild growth
With  regard  to  money  supply,  the  annual  growth  rate  of  M2  fell  from  6.80  in  February to 6.58 in March; the rate edged up to 6.70 in April as demand deposits  increased as a result of the governments universal surplus tax rebates
Since the start of the year, international oil prices recovered ground from previous lows
Taking this  assessment into account, the  Board judged that  maintaining the current  policy  rate levels  and monetary easing would help sustain price and financial  stability and foster economic  growth
Meanwhile, tight labor markets in the US  and  Europe  and  fragmentation  of  the  global  economy  could  make  it  difficult  to  ease  inflationary  pressures
One  board  director  pointed  out  that  the  Bank,  in  view  of  weak  momentum  for  domestic  economic  growth,  downgraded its forecast for Taiwans 2023 GDP growth  rate to below 2 with a possibility of turning lower
Even though monetary policy space could be smaller after this rate cut, Taiwan will not pursue negative interest rates
Core inflation excluding vegetables, fruit, and energy items recorded an average annual growth rate of 0.97, indicating mild price rises
Domestic  market  liquidity  was  ample  and  short  and  long -term  market  rates  fluctuated  within a narrow range in  recent  months
However, the US Fed is about to initiate the balance sheet normalization program, while the ECB may also review its asset purchase scheme
Once that expectation takes hold, it would be difficult to reverse the trend even with loan-to-value restrictions or tax-based policies
For the outlook of 2024 as a whole, domestic commodity prices would likely rise  mildly given that international oil prices were forecasted by foreign institutions to run  higher  than  2023
The  Bank  expec ted  Taiwans economy to grow by 3.08 in 2024
Building ownership transfers nationwide increased by 3.34 year-on-year in the first four months, with a 0.7 increase in the six Special Municipalities for January to May
Despite the steady pace of economic expansion, growth in exports and capital equipment imports both slowed, while retail sales also posted limited growth
Such  plans shall not adversely impact the funding needs of non-homeowners applying for  owner-occupied housing loans, or real estate sector entities looking to finance their  projects aligned with the government-promoted policies of urban renewal,  reconstruction  of  old  and  unsafe  buildings,  and  affordable  housing,  or  corporates  seeking capital to build or buy own-use plants or offices
It is estimated that the 0.25 percentage point hike in the RRRs would lead to a  combined increase of approximately NT120 billion in banks required reserves
Therefore, private investment is likely to register mild growth
This board director highlighted that, in accordance with the Central Bank of the R.O.C
The Bank revised down this years economic growth rate projection to 3.75
In  this  view,  the  Bank   needs  to  closely  monitor  the  developments  of  these  events  and  the  stances  of  major  central banks so as to adopt appropriate policy responses as needed
In  addition,  this  Board  decided  to  hold  rates  unchanged  in  September  even  as  the  economic  and  financial  conditions  were  more  stringent than the current environment
However, the core inflation rates did  not  drop  as  fast,  reflecting  slower  services  price  decreases  owing  to  downward  price  stickiness
In  the  months  since  midyear,  the  decline  in  Taiwans  export  growth  has  slowed as continued sluggishness in global final demand was somewhat offset  by  stronger  export  momentum  of  information  communication  technol ogy  products to meet demand for emerging technology applications and by  narrower  contractions  in  traditional  sector  exports
Global inflation is expected to rise steadily amid continued global economic growth and rising raw material prices
Moreover,  positive  readings from data on exports, investment, and consumption indicated that a rate hike  would  not  create  much  of  a  concern
There remain many uncertainties over international economic, trade, and financial prospects, including the lack of clarity in future developments of US trade policy towards China, Europe, and Japan, Chinas economic downturn, and possible extension of Brexit deadline
The interest rate charged on loans extended to SMEs under this facility would, preliminarily, be capped at the aforementioned rate on special accommodations plus one percentage point Appendix 1
A number of board directors believed that the Bank should continue to monitor changes in housing prices, and gave their views on the indicators helpful in making the decision to adopt selective credit controls
Taiwans  high-tech  manufacturers  increased  capital  expenditure,  leading  to  an  expansion  in  capital  equipment  imports
Another board director also stated that the April electricity tariff hike had a limited  effect  on  the  domestic  inflation  rate
Meanwhile, domestic demand was tepid as retail sales continued to contract in recent months, and private investment was somewhat reserved as reflected in declining capital equipment imports
Domestic inflation has been stabilizing and the output gap is expected to be modestly negative next year
This suggests that domestic financial conditions have been adequately accommodative and there is ample market liquidity to support expansions in corporate and household spending
In this view, the Bank revised its inflation forecasts to 2.09 for  both the inflation and core inflation rates for this year, which were lower than the levels  of 2022 at 2.95 and 2.61, respectively
Price  trends  in  the  year  so  far  pointed  to  a  downward  trend  in  the  core  inflation  rates in major economies, indicating continuous easing in global inflationary pressures
International oil prices touched a three-year high in late January and later fluctuated at a lower, narrow range in line with the changes in US crude oil inventories
The annual growth rate of the consumer price index CPI rose from 1.94 in April  2024  to  2.24  in  May,  mainly  owing  to  faster  growth  in  the  prices  of  fruit  and  vegetables
Regarding domestic demand, Taiwanese tech firms increased capital outlay, multinationals  increased  their  footprint  on  this  island,  while  the  government  continued  with  infrastructure  building for green energy and 5G network development and projects to facilitate urban renewal  and construction of social housing
For the first two  months  of  the  year,  banks  excess  reserves  averaged  around  NT54.9  billion;  the  annual  growth  rate  of  M2  measured  on  a  d aily  average  basis  and  that  of  bank loans and investments averaged 5.51 and 7.19 respectively
In light of elevated domestic inflation, a larger policy rate increase would more significantly exacerbate interest burdens of economically-vulnerable businesses and workers taking out relief loans and other policy loans; it would be more appropriate to adopt a more moderate pace for todays rate hike
The Peoples Bank of China, on the other hand, deployed more easing measures
The coronavirus outbreak is causing serious supply and demand shocks to the global economy
Consequently, oil prices moved downwards
However,  exports  still  saw  tepid  recovery  momentum  as  final  demand  remained  suppressed  by  a  dim  global  economic  outlook,  while  domestic  consumer spending was not sufficiently strong
Therefore,  it  would  not  be  appropriate  to  raise  the  policy  rates  in  todays meeting
In  addition,  the  Bank  estimated  that  Taiwan  would  have  a  slightly  negative output gap in both 2024 and 2025
For  the  outlook  of  next  year,  a  rebound  in  global  goods  trade  growth  as  projected by international institutions and the continuous boom in emerging  tech applications would likely bolster growth in Taiwans exports and private  investment
However, May data showed a 7.7 decline year-on-year
Manufacturing  and  non-manufacturing  sentiment  for  the  outlook  for  the  next  six  months,  albeit  climbing  back up, still exhibited caution
For the year as  a  whole,  export  growth  would  continue  to  receive  a  boost  from  the  steadily  rising  demand  for  emerging  tech  applications,  as  well  as  benefiting  from  an  increase  in  inbound  travel
Recent data on multiple inflation-related indicators all pointed to a prospective ease  in domestic inflationary pressures
While Taiwans inflation was mild relative to other major economies, it was  partly  sustained  by  tariff  and  tax  control  measures  aiming  at  restraining  raw  material  prices
However, the long-term effects of protracted low interest rates on Taiwans economy as a whole have been unclear and should be revealed in a timely manner
US and German 10-year government bond yields increased due to market expectations that the Fed would tighten monetary policy faster, begin shrinking its balance sheet, and that the ECB would end asset purchases and gradually start raising rates
Meanwhile, with the WTO Goods Trade Barometer recently climbing to a new high, the growth rate of world trade volume was also forecasted to rebound markedly this year and edge down somewhat next year
Therefore, to contain housing speculation and  property hoarding, and to prioritize the channeling of credit resources towards non- homeowners  seeking  owner-occupied  housing,  the  Board  would  consider  the  following amendments to the selective credit controls    a Imposing a new rule that no grace periods should be granted to a natural person  applying for a first outstanding home loan  when the  person already owns  buildings to hisher name
Taking into account the upside and downside factors, the director approved of a rate hold  and noted that, given the transmission lags of monetary policy, it was with hope that more  effects would show progressively
One way to increase banks willingness to lend to the distressed SMEs would be to raise the guarantee ratio of the Small and Medium Enterprise Credit Guarantee Fund of Taiwan SMEG, thereby mitigating lending risks and bringing down funding costs; it also seemed appropriate to allow banks to decide the levels of interest rates on such loans
Nevertheless, the impact from rising COVID-19 infections at home  since mid-May led to an increase in furloughs
Price changes in the CPI components  showed upward and downward swings in vegetables and services prices, but overall the  CPI  annual  growth  rate  gradually  came  down
The  Bank  will  assess  their  implication s  for  domestic  economic activity and financial conditions and adjust its monetary policy in  a timely manner as warranted, so as to fulfill the statutory duties of  maintaining financial and price stability and fostering economic development  within the scope of the aforementioned objectives
The board directors and supervisors approved unanimously to issue the press release in the post-meeting press conference, together with the Supplementary Materials for the Post-Monetary Policy Meeting Press Conference prepared by the Bank
The Bank has managed market liquidity through open market operations and kept banks excess reserves at an adequately accommodative level
Forecasts by  major domestic and foreign institutions for  Taiwans inflation rate ranged between 2.24  and  2.51  for  this  year  and  between  1.64 and 2.70 for the year 2024
Meanwhile, demand for funds driven by the economic recovery is expected to support continued growth in bank loans and investments
Another  board  director,  in  favor  of  a  rate  hold,  stated  that  a  pause  would  be  appropriate so that the Bank may review the effects of its monetary policy and take this  into consideration for the next policy meeting
Overall,  financial  conditions were accommodative
Despite recent consecutive negative CPI annual growth rates, a lot more items in the CPI basket of goods and services exhibited price rises than those items with price declines, indicating that there was barely a broad-based price downtrend, nor pronounced signs of deflation
One board director noted that against a backdrop of moderate economic growth and muted inflationary pressures, there existed no room for a rate hike
In terms of external demand, the global economic slowdown and US-China trade friction combined to drag export growth in major Asian economies, including Taiwan, into negative territory for the Jan.-Feb. period
For the  year as a whole, the prospects  of global  goods trade  growth firming  up  and  emerging  tech  applications  gaining  traction  would  likely  fuel  export  growth  and  bolster  private  investment
The Board Directors also discussed the Feds decision to initiate balance sheet normalization in October and how this might affect the NT dollar exchange rate
In terms of labor market conditions, the unemployment rate fell slightly compared to the same period of the previous year, whereas the number of employed persons recorded a modest year-on-year decrease
Several board directors expressed their views about the effects, participating banks, lending rates, and eligible borrowers under the proposed Facility, as well as the procedures to adjust the Facility if needed
The economy is expected to advance with moderate momentum in the second half of 2017 and in 2018
In  addition,  several  neighboring  economies  had  turned  less  hawkish  with  rate holds or even rate cuts
In the housing market, recent data showed housing trading cooled down, while real  estate  lending  continued  to  post  slower  year-on-year  growth,  albeit  with  a  still  high  outstanding balance
Still, the member agreed with todays 0.125  percentage point rate hike proposition
Nevertheless, considering that investment plans could be interrupted by this pandemic, as well as a higher base effect, the Bank forecasted a moderation in real private investment growth
The Bank of Japan BoJ also made no change in its easy policy stance
This is also the case for Taiwan
Compared to the previous forecast made in December 2023, there was a slight upward  revision  by  0.10  percentage  points,  reflecting  increased  contribution  from  net  foreign  demand and private consumption
The Bank expected that the inflation rate in the second half of the y ear would  be  slightly  lower  than  the  first  half
Domestic price trends for next year could face upside pressures from increased overseas and domestic travel due to border reopening, the scheduled hike in minimum wages, and possible electricity and gas rate hikes
Since the Board met in late June this year, advanced economies and emerging market economies have both been recovering at a steady pace
Meanwhile, SME  loans granted by banks under the Facility during the aforementioned period 20200401   20210704 will remain eligible for the Facilitys preferential interest rates until June 30,  2022
One other board director stated that as major economies implemented rate reductions Taiwan should not lag behind too much, citing also the remaining room for lower rates as well as the announcement effect of the Banks policy stance
In 2017 so far, as the NT dollar appreciation helped mitigate imported inflationary pressures and food prices stayed low, consumer prices have risen mildly
However, as lives began to return to normal after the pandemic waned, entertainment  prices experienced sharper-than-expected price surges; in addition, worldwide avian flu  pushed up prices of eggs and chicken meat and the domestic electricity tariffs were also  raised significantly
In terms of economic growth,  despite the aforementioned forecast downgrade for this  year, growth was projected to  accelerate next year
However, the semiconductor industry is known to be cyclical, and the industrys bust cycle would bode ill for private investment growth
The Board decided unanimously at the meeting today to raise the discount rate, the rate on refinancing of secured loans, and the rate on temporary accommodations to 1.5, 1.875, and 3.75, respectively, effective June 17, 2022
For the year of 2022, given a stable outlook for global oil prices forecasted by international  institutions,  the  Bank  projects  that  the  annual  growth  rates  of  the  CPI  and  the  core  CPI  would  both  drop  to  0.92
One board director noted the current economic situation was a moderate domestic  economy  confronted  by  an  external  cool-down
In terms of monetary policy developments overseas, central banks in advanced economies had kept policy rates unchanged in the year so far, albeit showing a more dovish turn in general
Therefore, to further enhance management of bank credit resources and reduce related  credit risk, the Bank decided to amend the Regulations Governing the Extension of  Mortgage Loans by Financial Institutions to lower the aforementioned LTV ratio cap  on natural persons second outstanding home loans for housing in the specific areas to  60, effective June 14, 2024 Appendix 1
According to the Banks estimation, the inflation  rate  this  year  would  peak  in  the  second  quarter owing to a one-off spike from the lower base a year ago
Both were considered conducive to private consumption, though wage growth was moderate
Nevertheless, the Forward-Looking Infrastructure Development Program rolled out by the government may shore up private investment, while mild wage increases are likely to boost private consumption, which will combine to bolster domestic demand as a major driving force for economic growth
On the other hand, the last time the Bank adjusted reserve requirements was more than a decade ago, and the effect of this type of adjustment at a time when bank excess reserves stayed somewhat elevated would be limited
The board directors decided to raise the discount rate, the rate on refinancing of secured loans, and the rate on temporary accommodations by 0.125 percentage points to 1.75, 2.125, and 4, respectively
We will also conduct a rolling review  on  the  results  of  these  regulations  and  measures  and  make  timely  adjustments  as  warranted to ensure sound banking operations and promote financial stability
One board director stated that, after the adjustments are approved, the Bank will meet with  banks with the aim of further improving the relevant rules
In  the  financial markets,  softening  US  inflation  and signs of  the  economy  weakening boosted market expectations of an earlier rate cut by the Fed next year, thus  sending the 10-year US Treasury yields sharply down and causing a broad rally across  major  stock  markets  around  the  world
Another board director noted that the consolidated land and housing income tax 2.0 entered into force not long ago, but recent data still showed excessively high annual growth rates of building ownership transfers and land sales
c The average LTV ratio for natural persons second housing loans for homes in the  specific areas was high and on the rise The Banks statistical data showed that  the average LTV ratio of this loan bracket was 75.5 in October 2021 but rose to  77.1 in April, showing a trend towards looser loan underwriting by banks
On  the  other  hand,  the  price  trends  in  the  intermeeting period were similar to those considered for the previous Board Meeting,  and it was forecasted that the inflation and core inflation rates would be lower this year  than last year and would likely ease to below 2 next year
One board director noted that the services sector was battered by the pandemic and was having a hard time regaining its footing
The global economic outlook remains clouded by pandemic uncertainties, including recurring  virus  outbreaks,  discovery  of  new  virus  variants,  and  uneven  vaccination  progress  across  regions
If these risks materialize or intensify, they could dampen the global economic recovery and hamper financial stability
The average annual growth rate of bank loans and investments  also increased from 6.26 in  the fourth quarter last  year  to 7.32 in  the first four  months this year
These  developments  indicated  solid  domestic  economic growth
With vegetable prices falling on the back of stable weather conditions, communications rates decreasing, and consumer electronics products offered at promotional prices, the annual growth rates of CPI and core CPI stayed low for the first two months of the year
All board directors favored the decision to keep the policy interest rates unchanged, based  mainly on the uncertainty surrounding economic growth amid the recent domestic virus flareup
Moreover, for the year to date, export growth would have turned negative when excluding electronic partscomponents or those shipped to China
In addition, the Bank estimated that Taiwan would have a slightly negative output  gap in 2024
For the first two months of 2022, the consumer price index CPI posted an average  annual growth rate of 2.60, a still fast pace mainly because of domestic fuel price  hikes  following  international  oil  rallies  and  cost-pushed  price  increases  for  food  away  from  home,  as  well  as  rising  prices  for  fruit,  durable  consumer  goods,  and flight  tickets
In  addition, next years hikes in base wage and public sector pay are likely to inspire a private  sector wage increase
This called for the  Banks close attention and, if necessary, might require a new round of selective credit  controls on the real estate market
The  Bank projected Taiwans economy to expand by 4.05 this year, while the growth  projections by major institutions ranged between 3.11 and 4.42
However,  with  major  central  banks  such  as  the  US  Federal  Reserve  Fed  and  the  European  Central  Bank  ECB  maintaining  high  policy  rates,  the  global  economy  continued to experience tepid growth momentum
Recently, the US Federal Reserve Fed continued with rate holds  while the European Central Bank just delivered a rate cut
The average projections for Taiwans inflation rate in 2021 and 2022 by major forecasting  institutions had slowly trended upwards since the beginning of 2021 but remained below 2,  indicating mild pressures of inflation
In the meantime, trade tension among major economies had weighed on global trade growth momentum
2 Financial conditions    From June 2023 onwards, interbank funds transfers increased against a backdrop  of  banks  turning  in  the  collected  income  taxes  to  the  National  Treasury,  large  firms  giving out cash dividends, and foreign institutional investors making outward  remittances of the proceeds from net-selling local stocks
Nevertheless,  given  the  monetary  tightening  actions  by  most  major central banks and a recent  decline in energy prices, the world would likely see  next years inflation come down from previous highs
In  regard  to  global  commodities,  oil  prices  turned  lower  from  October  onwards  owing to a softer-than-expected impact of the Israel-Hamas conflict on crude oil supply,  a still tepid Chinese economy, and increased US crude oil inventories
Monetary Policy Decision The board directors reached a unanimous vote to raise  the discount rate, the rate on refinancing of secured loans, and the rate on temporary  accommodations by 25 basis points to 1.375, 1.75, and 3.625, respectively
Thereafter,  despite continued weakness in exports and private investment in recent months, an  expansion  in  private  consumption  was  expected  to  bolster  economic  growth  for  the  second  quarter
It is thus important to explore potential structural impacts of sustained monetary accommodation on the economy as a whole and whether the Bank has enough wiggle room if a sharper financial recession strikes
Prices of new housing units were trending up, reflecting the rise in national Urban Land  Price Index compiled by the Ministry of the Interior in March 2022
Bank  loans  and  investments  further  decreased  from 6.66 of the fourth quarter of 2022 to 5.55 in the first four months of 2023
Therefore, the pressing issue of inflation should be given  priority
Grains prices had stayed low with modest volatility since October and the  ReutersJefferies  CRB  RJCRB  Index,  a  global  commodities  benchmark,  moved  downwards alongside crude oil price declines
Board members reached a unanimous vote to keep the discount rate, the rate on accommodations with collateral, and the rate on accommodations without collateral unchanged at 1.375, 1.75, and 3.625, respectively
While the government has begun to introduce relief measures and stimulus programs, the Bank has also undertaken supportive actions with an easy monetary environment and a special SME accommodation facility
In addition, geopolitical risks and climate change also  add to uncertainties facing global inflation trends
While it has been a while since the tool was last deployed, the increase in the reserve requirement ratios in todays meeting would affect money supply through the money multiplier effect, the positive and negative outcomes of which should be rigorously followed to help guide future policy formulation
For  the first five months of 2023, the annual growth rate of the CPI averaged 2.44  and that of the core CPI averaged 2.68
Consumer confidence has been robust, and the domestic economy has continued to grow
Thereafter, as the domestic coronavirus outbreak remained contained, the indices for future outlooks for the following six months under Taiwans Manufacturing PMI Purchasing Managers Index and NMI Non-Manufacturing Index both continued to rise, pointing to stable outlooks as anticipated by businesses and a likely upturn in domestic economic growth in the latter half of the year
These developments carried positive implications  for financial stability and indicated that the Banks rate hikes were beginning to show  results
One board director commented in regard to the virus impact on prices, stating that despite downside pressures from international oil slumps and soft domestic consumer spending, this pandemic could cause upside pressures
The Special Accommodation Facilitys interest rate on re-accommodations to banks  Maintained at the current level of 0.1 until June 30, 2022 to ensure funding ease  for SMEs after the policy rate hike  Under the Banks Special Accommodation Facility to Support Bank Credit to Small  and Medium-Sized Enterprises SMEs launched in April 2020, financial institutions  have approved preferential loans to more than 300 thousand borrowers with the total  amount exceeding NT500 billion
In terms of international financial market trends since August 2022, as the Federal  Reserve Fed and the European Central Bank ECB signaled for further tightening, the  U.S. and German10-year government bond yields both rebounded
The member thus supported the 0.125 percentage point rate hike as  a preemptive move
Upward pressures on prices may come from 1 price increases for services such as buses and restaurants owing to higher labor costs under the five-day workweek system, 2 higher cigarette prices as a result of the June 12 hike of the cigarette tax by NT20 per pack, and 3 an expected upsurge in vegetable prices owing to torrential rain in June
Regarding  monetary policy  in the  year so far,  most economies, including the  US  and  Europe,  continued  to  raise  policy  rates  whereas  some  central  banks  began  to  slow or pause the pace of rate hikes based on considerations of economic prospects and  in order to assess the effects of previous rate increases
prices  and subdued fuel and lubricant fees, reaching 2.02 in May
Take for instance electronic parts and components firms, which could easily fall victim to a supply dislocation
One board director approved of the Banks recent moral suasion  on  banks  to  enhance internal management of the total volume of real estate lending and stated that  todays policy moves  adjusting selective credit controls and raising the RRRs  would  help  curb  excessive  credit  flows  to  the  real  estate  market
Global  trade  was  also  forecasted  by  international  institutions  to  grow  slower  in  2022 than in 2021 as the WTO Goods Trade Barometer slid deeper this year so far
The director highlighted that the annual growth rate of the monetary aggregate M2 continued to exceed 6.5, the upper threshold of the Banks M2 growth reference range, and noted the widening interest rate differential between Taiwan and the US
Meanwhile,  a  historically  low  rate  level,  upside  inflationary  pressures from rising raw material prices and transportation costs, and ample market liquidity all  made a rate cut an ill-timed adjustment
For  the  second  half  of  the  year,  despite  sluggish investment growth, exports would likely regain momentum from reduced  inventory levels in global supply chains, while domestic demand continues to firm  up  thanks  to  solid  private  consumption  growth  and  the  governments  newly- launched  initiative  to  promote  post-pandemic  economic  resilience  and  to  share  growth  results  nationwide  with  a  universal  surplus  tax  rebate  program;  it  is  therefore expected that economic growth would rebound in the latter half of 2023
With regard to real estate lending by banks, the annual growth rate had  slowed since the Bank implemented selected credit control measures in December 2020
On  the  other  hand,  the  Bank  made  another  downgrade  to  its  2023  GDP  growth  rate  forecast and estimated that the output gap would remain negative this year
In the face of drastic price volatility caused by supply-side factors, monetary policy responses such as aggressive tightening could concomitantly restrain economic output; therefore, supply-side measures would serve better under the circumstances
Hopes of smaller Fed rate increases and concerns about a looming European recession caused US and German 10-year government bond yields to fall, while global stock markets rallied
Meanwhile, banks excess reserves stayed at levels between NT40 billion and NT60 billion
Nonetheless,  when  seasonal  or  irregular  factors  such  as  massive  inflows  or  outflows of short-term capital lead to excess volatility and disorderly movements  in the NT dollar exchange rate with adverse implications for economic and financial  stability, the Bank, in line with its statutory mandates, will step in to maintain an  orderly market
Overall, in view of bleak prospects for exports and private investment,  the Bank  downgraded the 2023 GDP growth rate forecast to 2.21, lower than the 2022 growth  rate of 2.45
The Bank tackled housing price elevation by increasing the cost and limiting the source of funds for property buyers via LTV ratio caps
Another board director agreed with the rate cut decision, citing a forecast downgrade for domestic economic growth and an uncertain outlook
Moreover, the projections made by international  institutions for Taiwans five-year inflation expectations were also mild, ranging between 1.4  and 1.6
In  this  view,  the  Board  judged  that  a  rate  hike  would  help  contain  domestic  inflation expectations and achieve the policy objectives of price stability and sound  financial and economic development
However, given this was a small increase by 12.5 basis points, it would be important to heed potential impacts of a wider US-Taiwan interest rate differential on capital flows and NT dollar exchange rates
2 Discussions on housing prices, residential rent, and consumer price measurement  One board director noted that although tax policies may be the most effective tool  to tamp down housing prices, as repeatedly stressed by the Bank and supported by some  researches, this does not keep monetary authorities on the sidelines when housing prices  continue to surge
Reflecting the Banks monetary tightening, interest rates on  bank  deposits  and  loans  rose  higher  and  money  market  rates  all  trended  up
While short-term market interest rates fluctuated slightly, Taiwans government bond  yields tracked the uptrend of US Treasury yields and edged up
Import prices and prices of domestic sales excluding imports  posted  a  year-on-year  increase  of  1.08  and  0.82,  respectively,  for  the  first  eight  months of the year, indicating an absence of imported inflation pressures
Related discussions are  summarized as follows
Meanwhile, real estate loans continued to take up a rising share in  total loans
Combined with a lower base effect, the annual export growth rate was 12.5 for the first five months of the year, with positive growth registered in exports to all major destination economies
Non-performing housing loans remained low at 0.08
Policy Proposition To keep the discount rate, the rate on refinancing of secured loans,  and the rate on temporary accommodations unchanged at 1.125, 1.5, and 3.375,  respectively; to adjust the Banks selective credit control measures
Another Board Director mentioned that while anticipating Taiwans economy to grow faster next year than this year amid a bright global outlook and a gradual domestic recovery, the Bank also projects the negative output gap to widen; this calls for further in-depth study
Deliberations on the content of the selective credit control measures  One board director stated that in an market economy, property investment should be done  with own funds instead of tapping bank loans; in that sense, the LTV cap on new housing loans  for borrowers with at least two outstanding loans should be even lower than proposed
For the Bank to safeguard financial stability, it needs to take policy  actions in response to housing price changes
Major institutions project Taiwans economy to expand between 2.63 and 3.45 in 2022 and between 1.58 and 2.91 in 2023
In sum, uncertainties over the global economic outlook still weigh on external demand; domestic demand is mild, and economic growth, though projected to pick up at a moderate pace in the second half of this year and next year, would still run below potential
In regard to wage growth in the year to date, nominal  growth of total earnings of manufacturing workers slowed year on year owing to export  contraction,  whereas  that  of  services  workers  increased  as  in-person  consumption  rebounded after the pandemic receded
One board director noted the high uncertainty over the COVID-19 pandemic and the  conspicuous gap across industries; for instance, the electronics industry was largely unscathed  and some even benefited from the pandemic, whereas such sectors as food and beverages and  travel and tourism took a heavy blow
By  frequency  of  purchase,  prices  of  staples  more  frequently  purchased  rose  at  a  slightly slower pace in November
One board director pointed to the current environment where Taiwans SMEs were having difficulties because of the virus outbreak
For the first eight months of the year, the annual CPI growth rate for  rent came higher than last year, while that for entertainment services was elevated; given  that housing rent and prices of services tend to exhibit downward price stickiness, the  future path of these categories warrant continuous monitoring
One board director, referring to Taiwans warm inside, cold outside economy,  pointed  out  that  while  external  demand  was  dampened  by  tighter  monetary  and  economic  conditions  abroad,  domestic  private  investment  could  also  be  dented  as  exports and the manufacturing production index continued declining
Although the  selective credit controls had achieved some results, they would still need to be accompanied by  other types of policy efforts if the housing price problem is to be successfully tackled
The future path of domestic inflation would be affected by weather events  and price trends of international commodities as well as domestic services
The core CPI excluding fruit, vegetables, and energy recorded an average annual growth rate of 0.24
Taking into account a lower comparison base this year, the Bank forecasted  that next years real growth in private investment would excess this years
The  Board  decided  to  raise  the  discount  rate,  the  rate  on  refinancing  of  secured loans, and the rate on temporary accommodations by 0.125  percentage  points to  2, 2.375,  and 4.25, respectively, effective  March  22, 2024
Given the downward  price stickiness of rent, if housing prices continue climbing and push up rent along the  way, it would pose  an  even greater  challenge for price stability
Banks excess reserves averaged slightly above NT45 billion for the two months of  March and April
However, synchronized policy rate hikes by major central banks, including the Fed and the ECB, could further slow global growth, undermine financial stability, and heighten economic risks
As a result of mild domestic inflation, Taiwans real interest rate has returned to positive territory whereas those of many major economies remain negative
The  annual  growth  rate  of  the  CPI  came  back  down  in  November,  mainly  owing  to  slower increases in prices of vegetables, fuel and lubricants, and entertainment services
Nevertheless, uncertainties  still exist for this outlook

Looking  ahead  to  next  year,  employment  and  wage  growth  are  likely  to  benefit  from the recovery in domestically-oriented services sector, helping to extend the  uptrend  in  private  consumption
Going forward, the Bank will  continuously monitor the developments in housing credit and the real estate market  and  the  implementation  results  of  the  selective  credit  control  measures,  and  will  make  adjustments  as  needed  in  order  to  promote  financial  stability  and  sound  banking operations

Projections by domestic and foreign institutions place Taiwans annual CPI growth rate between 2.9 and 3.1 for 2022 and between 1.21 and 2.5 for 2023, with the average forecast for next year below 2
As imported raw material prices such as crude oil are expected to rise this year and the hikes in minimum wage and public sector employee pay may spur wage increases for workers in the private sector, domestic prices are likely to go up
Looking ahead, key determinants of future price trends include upside pressures from the following last years price decline for fruit and vegetables owing to abundant supply is likely to result in a steeper increase in food prices this year; the base wage hike this year would drive upwards employee pay and prices for away-from-home food; coach bus fares would be raised from March onwards
Compared to other economies, Taiwans inflation was mild and expected to drop below but close to 2
Given  the  high  uncertainties, the director supported a 0.125 percentage point rate increase
September meeting of the US Federal Open Market Committee FOMC still viewed that elevated inflation largely reflected transitory factors but did not completely dismiss concerns

Adjustments to the expiry dates of the Banks Special Accommodation Facility  Back in April 2020, the Bank launched the Special Accommodation Facility to Support Bank  Credit to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises SMEs
One board director stated that, from the perspective of bank lending risk  management, it was sensible to introduce the new restriction
In  more  recent  months,  international  oil  and  other  commodity  prices  trended  down, services price rises moderated, and global inflation further eased
For instance, inflation expectations of households could well overshoot actual inflation as the day-to-day shopping experience of goods and services tends to dictate public expectations of inflation
Though still not radical in the near term, structural changes, once set off, would have a greater effect in the coming years
The Board decided to keep the discount rate, the rate on refinancing of secured loans,  and the rate on temporary accommodations  unchanged  at 2, 2.375, and 4.25,  respectively
In addition, the Banks gradual approach to monetary tightening since  March  2022  has  also  helped  reinforce  the  effectiveness  of  the  selective  credit  control  measures
Discussion on the Banks special accommodation facility to support SMEs    One board director pointed out the fact that the Banks special accommodation  facility to  support SMEs hereinafter  the facility was introduced in March 2020 in  tandem  with  a  25  bps  rate  reduction;  accordingly,  a  25  bps  rate  hike  in  this  Meeting  should lead to a simultaneous increase in the rate on the facilitys special  accommodations to banks

One  board  director  put  forward  a  proposition  that,  for  the  benefit  of  monetary  policy  implementation, the Bank may begin to conduct surveys on inflation expectations and consumer  finances at its earliest convenience
Nonetheless,  inflation expectations may influence consumer behavior, which in turn may influence actual  inflation
In January 2023, a flow of currency back into the banking system after  the  Lunar  New  Year  holidays  caused  interest  rates  of  bank  and  money  markets  to  fluctuate  within  a  tight  range
Meanwhile,  although  staples  with  a  higher  purchase frequency had seen smaller price rises in the year so far, they still gained more  markedly compared to the overall inflation rate, thereby intensifying consumer  sentiment of price rises
One board director noted that data on the fundamentals indicated a steady domestic  economy but there remained sluggish growth and slackening manufacturing momentum
Looking  ahead,  the  global  economic  outlook  still  faces  uncertainties,  mainly  from  1  repeated COVID-19 outbreaks, new virus variants, and uneven vaccination progress, leading to a  longer  wait  before  the  pandemic  can  be  well  contained;  2  a  continued  buildup  of  financial  fragilities, including elevated asset prices around the world and an outsize global debt overhang;  3 changes in monetary policy of major central banks, which could trigger global financial market  turbulence; 4 lingering global economic and trade uncertainties such as US-China relations, as  well  as  risks  associated  with  climate  change
In  addition,  global  inflation  prospects  remain  uncertain  as  commodity supply is threatened by climate change and geopolitical risks
One board director stated that monetary policy-making needs to take into account  public perception of prices
In terms of private consumption, labor market conditions were stable, the unemployment rate edged down further, and the number of employed persons increased steadily
However, overtime hours worked in the manufacturing sector posted year-on-year decreases for four consecutive months

Another  board director pointed that, in fact, as early as the end of 2023, some banks had begun  to  dial  down  real  estate  lending  as  they  came  close  to  the  aforementioned  regulatory  limit of 30 or their internal control level
For 2023, oil prices are forecasted to be lower than in 2022

In the first four months of the year, labor market conditions were stable, and the  unemployment rate dropped
While  Ukrainian grain exports hampered by the war have been easing somewhat, many of their  crop areas were no longer arable; combined with adverse weather conditions such as  droughts  in  other  major  food  commodity  exporters,  feed  prices  remained  elevated,  which could affect domestic prices of eggs and meat and impact the CPI trends
Meanwhile, the Fed carried on with rate hikes, there remained international economic uncertainties, and some central banks made prudent decisions to hold rates unchanged, including Taiwans major trading partners such as China, Japan, and the euro area, and a primary export rival South Korea
As to the issue of inflation and how inflation  expectations and pressures develop, potential structural changes in the long term should also be  taken into account

One Board Supervisor stated that among the five challenging issues, electricity shortage is a key concern that could thwart investment
Since the Board met in December last year, global economic and trade momentum  has  moderated,  prices  of  commodities  such  as  international  crude  oil  have  exhibited  a  downtrend,  and  global  inflation  has  fallen  back  down  gradually
Being a small open economy, Taiwan also needs  to take into account the effect of major economies monetary policy actions; as major central  banks mostly kept an easy monetary policy stance, the conditions were not suitable for the Bank  to hike rates
One board director remarked that domestic consumer price trends were relatively steady, and a rate hike out of step with major economies could amplify the NTD strength
For  the  second  quarter,  the  economy  was  expected  to  exhibit  solid  growth, with data in recent months showing a rebound in private investment as well  as continuous growth in exports and private consumption
Moreover, recurring COVID-19 pandemic outbreaks would also add uncertainties to the global economy
In  contrast,  services  prices  would  likely  extend  the  slowdown  from  the  fourth  quarter  of  2023  onwards
In  addition,  keeping  inflation  in  check  would  likely  boost  slow-growing  real  wages
Therefore, inflationary pressures were contained
While  taking  into  account  the  continuous  export  contraction, the Banks monetary policy actions would have a relatively limited impact  on this issue given that waning foreign demand was the culprit
In regard to bank credit in the year so far, bank lending to the private sector grew steadily, but the pace was slower than the previous year as some companies issued corporate debt to repay bank loans, locking in lower funding cost for a longer term
Domestic services prices were expected to show a slower  increase owing to a high base effect
Against such a background, commodity  prices  have  registered  a  narrower  increase  because  of  cooling  demand,  whereas  services  price  increase  have  remained  stubbornly  strong  as  a  partial  shift  of  consumer demand from commodity to services boosted demand for foodbeverage  and entertainment services and the related imbalance between services labor supply  and  demand  also  pushed  up  labor  costs
Meanwhile, rising prices of oil and of fruit and vegetables  also drove the inflation rate upwards, albeit judged to be temporary
Excess reserves in the banking sector were kept at a higher level, increasing from over NT40 billion of the previous quarter to a level higher than NT50 billion on average for the Jan.-Feb. period
Despite a rate hold, the Peoples Bank of China cut reserve requirements for all banks to keep credit conditions accommodative
Meanwhile, private consumption rose steadily, and private investment posted  a smaller contraction
The global economic outlook also faces other causes for concern, including uncertainties associated with international economic and trade policies, the progress of Brexit negotiations, and geopolitical risks
We  were  told  that  although  the  prudential measures did help dampen speculative demand, housing prices were not expected to  decline soon given recent waves of capital repatriation and rising construction costs
Meanwhile, bank loans and investments are likely to grow steadily as the domestic recovery and mild growth in fixed investment drive a stable demand for funds
In particular, one board director pointed out that, while the real interest rate turned negative as opposed to the positive value when the board convened last time, this measure was just one of the elements for the Banks monetary policy deliberation
With the pandemics impact diminishing at home, the number of employed persons  increased by 0.29 year on year in July
Domestic  consumption  is  also  expected to increase moderately
Meanwhile, the Bank still needs to keep close  watch on the issue of persistent inflation
One Board Director showed support for maintaining the current policy rate level, saying that caution is warranted as central banks of Taiwans major trading partners, as well as main export competitors including South Korea, also held rates unchanged at the juncture where another Fed rate hike is expected near the end of the year
In the meantime, most  major  stock  markets  recorded  upswings
The  ratio  of  real  estate  loans to total loans concentration of banks lending in real estate  loans increased to 37.5 at the end of August, close to the historical high of 37.9
Regarding financial conditions, one board director stated that domestic financial conditions  were  stable,  whereas  the  global  economic  outlook  remained  shrouded  in  many  uncertainties  including mounting financial fragilities and turmoil in major financial markets
However, considering that the currently low rates also left little room for a rate cut, it would be the appropriate decision to keep policy rates unchanged
The Bank expected the inflation rate to come down  slowly during the second half of the year with the fourth quarter witnessing a pace of  around 2
Bank loans and investments rose steadily, with increased demand from both private and public enterprises
For housing  loans to corporate entities, high-value housing loans, and the third or more  housing loans to natural persons, the LTV ratio caps would both be lowered to  30
Several  board  directors  also  expressed  concern  about  the  situation  where  a  borrower  inherits  a  housing  property  with  an  outstanding  loan but has to take out the second loan to buy a home because of job-related relocation,  subjecting the borrower to the new stricter credit controls of no grace period and lower  LTV ratios
Domestic inflation has continued to come down gradually in the year so far and is  expected to drop to below 2 next year
Meanwhile,  the  survey  on  firms  showed  that  most  respondents  expected  the  CPI  inflation rate to stay below 2 in the same period, indicating still mild inflation expectations
In the future, the Bank should continue monitoring developments related to real estate lending and, if necessary, take further measures in a timely manner
The normalization move would also be warranted  by  the  fact  that  interest  rates  had  stayed  low  for  a  long  while
The Board considered the economic and financial conditions at home and abroad in todays  meeting The current domestic inflation situation is viewed as manageable and the inflation  rate is expected to return to a slower pace next year
During the first eleven months of the year, the CPI increased by 2.48 on average  over the same period last year
Research shows that Taiwans housing price cycle runs ahead of the credit cycle, suggesting that housing price increases are not primarily driven by bank credit growth
One board supervisor added that the CPI spike in February was also attributable to the deferred impact of last years cigarette tax hike, and the same price measure would be significantly lower by excluding the seasonal factor and the tax effect
This supervisor also pointed out that domestic economic growth was not as slow as perceived by the public, let alone recessionary
This has led to a downward trend in the annual growth rate of the CPI, which registered 2.35 in November
Meanwhile, local consumer demand was impaired as the virus outbreak persisted; some service providers tried to lure customers with lower prices
The director cited recent data as the reasons  backing up a rate hold for now First, the headline inflation rate began trending down after  a streak of rate hikes and the economy still faced a relatively low probability of recession  in the next quarter despite the recent forecast downgrade
In addition, monetary tightening since March would also help dampen housing credit growth
Considering that the average mortgage burden ratio monthly housing loan repayment as a  percentage of monthly disposable income of Taiwanese households exceeds 30, the  Bank urges mortgage borrowers to caution an immediate increase in repayment after the  grace period and a risk of possible interest rate changes
This years uptrend in the annual CPI growth rate was due to supply side factors and a lower  base effect, which would likely decline next year, indicating little urgency to apply rate  hikes against inflation
With corporate profits growing, employers might be more willing to increase hiring and hand out bonus pay
For the first eight  months  of  the  year,  the  headline  inflation  rate  averaged  2.29  and  the  core  inflation rate averaged 2.66
Inflation projections by domestic and foreign institutions ranged from 2.20 to 3.80
One  supervisor  pointed  out  that  some  of  the  data  on  consumer  finances might not be available owing to trade secret protection
Domestic demand, on the  other hand, gained support from private consumption thanks to the lifting of pandemic- related  restrictions  and  the  universal  surplus  tax  rebates  as  well  as  other  stimulus  schemes under the governments special budget for post-pandemic economic recovery
With the interest rates already at a relatively lower level, the future policy space will be limited
For the first seven months of the year, the average annual growth rates of the monetary aggregate M2 and of bank loans and investments were 4.72 and 5.91, respectively, indicating that money and credit conditions were sufficient to support domestic economic activity
