A series of uncertainties have sowed the seeds of this concern, including the US-China trade conflicts, which are not merely some transitory events but represent fundamentally a contest for technological dominance
On balance, this director viewed that a rate hold would be the  appropriate decision
Against this background, in  order to contain domestic inflation expectations, the Board judged that a rate  hike  would  help  sustain  price  stability  and  foster  sound  economic  and  financial development on the whole
The  Non-Manufacturing  Index  NMI  and  its  six-month  outlook  subindex remained expansionary, pointing to sustained economic recovery and  manufacturing growth momentum picking up
Looking at next year, the base wage increase, the public sector pay raise, and potential price  hikes in some sectors to reflect higher personnel and raw material costs could push prices  upwards
For  the  first  five  months of the year, the average annual growth rates of the CPI and the core CPI were 1.39  and  1.13,  respectively,  representing  mild  price  uptrends  for  both
Recent data  also suggest that growth in construction loans of all banks have continued to slow
Discussion on the proposition to adjust selective credit control measures  Several board directors expressed the opinion that by introducing a new 70 cap  on the LTV ratio on second housing loans taken out by natural persons for homes in the  designated specific areas it would help enhance lending risk management of banks,  improve  proper  allocation  of  credit  resources,  achieve  a  healthy  housing  market,  and  promote financial stability
The CPI annual growth rate of food away from home has gone above 4 every month  since  February  2022,  except  for  February  2023
In sum, for the year to date, M2 and bank credit exhibited stable growth, indicating that credit market had sufficient liquidity to support real economic activity
As a result of mild inflation, Taiwans real interest rate has returned to positive territory, whereas many major economies continued to register negative real interest rates
In addition, given  that  changes  in  rental  costs  usually  lag  behind  housing  prices,  the  effect  of  further  housing price rises on rent and, in turn, on the CPI inflation requires monitoring
Nonetheless, with major institutions projecting a slower ascent for international  oil prices in 2022, the Bank expects the domestic CPI annual growth rate to drop to 1.59  and the core CPI to maintain mild growth at a pace of 1.45
The  recent  Russian  invasion  of  Ukraine  has  propelled  major economies to impose economic and financial sanctions on Russia, hampering  global commodity supply, inducing commodity price surges, and thereby creating  further inflationary pressures
Do the same factors  that have held inflation steady or down in the past three decades remain in sight?
In addition,  data  on  exports  in  the  year  up  to  May  showed  that  only  AI-related  ICTAV  exports  recorded  fast  growth  whereas  the  rest  product  categories  posted  negative  growth
For  this  year  as  a  whole,  the  annual  growth  rate  of  the  CPI  and  that  of  the  core  CPI were forecasted to register 2.22 and 2.44, respectively see Appendix  Table 2 for the forecasts by major institutions, lower than the 2022 readings  of 2.95 and 2.61
Meanwhile, housing transaction volume has gained a better footing, in tandem with price corrections
However, this outlook could still change depending on prices trends of  international commodities and domestic services, as well as weather events
Compared with major economies, Taiwans economy is projected to be relatively resilient in both 2020 and 2021
In addition, geopolitical risks and  climate  change could  also affect the progress of global disinflation
The  forecasts  by  international  and  domestic  institutions  for  Taiwans inflation next year average around 1.37
As of the end of April  2021,  the  annual  growth  rate  of  SME  loans  extended  by  banks  registered  13.46  and  the  annual growth rate of overall bank lending was 7.32
With weakening global demand, easing supply chain bottlenecks, and declining raw material prices, global inflation is expected to moderate in the coming year
With respect to global inflation, it was expected to soften this year as a result of the  effects from monetary tightening by major economies, global consumer demand cooling  off, and international energy prices trending down
One noted that, despite the impact from the pandemic, Taiwans economic fundamentals were stronger than many other economies
Regarding the CPI for rent, it climbed back up in August from a  modest  downswing earlier
In terms of  money supply, reflecting the slowdown in bank loans and investments and a  year-on- year increase of foreign capital outflows, as well as the Banks hikes of policy rates and  the RRRs, the M2 annual growth rate had trended downwards since May this year, with  the pace of growth averaging 7.66 for the first eight months of the year
Another board director stated that housing loans granted with high LTV ratios are susceptible to a price trend reversal that could  cause the amount of the loans to exceed the market value of their collaterals, creating credit risk  to banks; likewise, risk therefrom would be smaller if the LTV ratios are lower
Both  Japan  and  Germany  saw  their  10-year  government  bond  yields  climbing  upwards
As a small  open economy, Taiwan could be impacted by spillover effects via the following three  channels    The real economy With global final demand weakening, Taiwans exports have  seen  slower  growth  in  recent  months  and  private  investment  has  turned  conservative
As  a result, Taiwans headline inflation was mild compared to major economies
One board director pointed out that M2 growth still has influence on  prices over the longer term
Given the pandemics economic shock and rising uncertainties over the pandemic and economic and trade policies, international forecasters projected that it would be difficult for world trade volume to stage a strong recovery next year
Projections for Taiwans GDP growth rate in 2020 by major forecasting institutions fell between -1.36 and 1.83, and all of them expected next years growth to be faster, with projections ranging from 1.40 to 3.92
With regard to advanced economies, the US expansionary fiscal stimulus is likely to drive up global economic growth, while the outlook for Europe and Japan seems brighter on the back of growth in global manufacturing sectors and world trade
With global economic and trade activity on the mend,  demand  for  emerging  tech  applications  and  remote-working  products  staying  strong,  and  manufacturers  in  Taiwan  expanding  capacity,  the  Bank  projected  Taiwans exports  to  enjoy  solid growth in real terms this year
In respect of domestic economic conditions, several board directors discussed the issue of domestic investment growth momentum
If the RRRs are to be  raised further in the future, M2 growth would likely soften more markedly, which  could amplify the effect of denting inflation expectations
While discussing the interest rate decision, many board directors said that they have taken stock of domestic inflation outlook, economic growth, and the real interest rate and noted that current and expected inflation were both mild, the output gap was still negative, and uncertainties continued to weigh on economic prospects at home and abroad
Therefore, the director was in favor of keeping the policy rates steady
However, in addition to a slowing global economy, the continuous rise in US oil production would probably balance out the effect of production cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries
In terms of money supply trends since April this year, the annual growth rate of the  monetary aggregate M2 first rose to 6.25 in June alongside the rising annual growth  rate  of  loans  and  investments;  afterwards,  M2  growth  dropped  to  an  annual  pace  of  5.80 in August owing to net capital outflows
However,  an  upturn in the annual growth rate of housing loans from the second half of 2023 onwards  caused real estate lending to take up a large share in total bank lending
Data also  showed that building ownership transfers in these two area categories rose year on year  by  33.3  and  24.3  in  July  2024,  respectively
Under the circumstances, large capital flows could move to Taiwan, carrying adverse implications for the foreign exchange market, financial stability, and the real economy
And though the proposed NT200 billion Facility was preliminarily designed to run for a short term, an extension or expansion might be considered should the SMEs still remain financially strapped later on
For  the  outlook  of  the  entire  year,  domestic  commodity  prices  would  likely  rise  mildly given that international oil prices were forecasted  by foreign institutions to  go  modestly higher than 2023
The  director  then  cited  the  International  Monetary  Fund,  whose  World  Economic  Outlook  stated  that  continued  rate  hikes  by  major economies since last year caused the world to face  anemic economic growth in  the  next  five  years,  a  rocky  road  fraught  with  uncertainties
From June onwards, on account of the rebound in domestic food prices, the CPI annual growth rate displayed a mild uptrend and reached 0.96 in August
In terms of private consumption, the easing of pandemic containment measures and  border controls would bolster consumer confidence and retail and foodbeverage sales;  the planned hike in minimum wage and higher income tax-free allowance, as well as the  governments  universal  surplus  tax  rebate  program,  would  also  help  sustain  growth  momentum
One board director stated that the domestic inflation rate had been above 2 since April 2021 and was expected to remain so for the rest of 2022, longer than previously projected, while surveyed data also showed that experts and scholars still envisaged inflation exceeding 2 next year
Moreover,  though  being  closely  watched  by  the  Bank,  housing prices as an indicator does not in itself necessitate a systemic policy response
For the first eleven months of the year, the average annual growth rates of the  CPI and the core CPI were 1.91 and 1.28, respectively
Another  board  director  remarked  that  the  Bank  should  take  action  to  vigorously  fight inflation and, in particular, inflation expectations; therefore, the director supported  the rate hike proposition
Another board director pointed out that, despite a large basket of CPI components, the  public tend to response more strongly to the price rises in staple goods as they purchase these  items more frequently
Notwithstanding  the gradual slowdown in the inflation rate, persistent inflation remained a concern, and  it is crucial to continue monitoring how long the CPI annual growth rate would come  down below 2 since this would affect the anchoring of inflation expectations; it is also  important for monetary policy actions to be taken when necessary
To address the pandemics impact, major economies kept their monetary policy stances accommodative and continued to roll out large fiscal stimulus programs
The Bank forecasts this years CPI annual growth rate to be 1.07 and core CPI 1.11
The Bank will continue to closely monitor new developments of the coronavirus outbreak and the monetary policy actions by major economies, as well as the resultant effects on the economic and financial conditions at home and abroad
On the other hand, the selective credit control measures  could be  deployed to keep new property  investors and new speculators from entering  the housing market by denying them easy access to banks housing credit
The developments of the COVID-19 outbreak will be a key variable for Taiwans economy this year
At  the  meeting  today,  the  Board  decided  to  raise  the  discount  rate,  the  rate  on  refinancing of secured loans, and the rate on temporary accommodations by 0.125  percentage  points  each  to  1.875,  2.25,  and  4.125,  respectively,  effective  March 24, 2023
Inflation was expected to reach significantly higher levels compared to the previous year
The  US  dollar  index  rebounded  and  major  currencies broadly depreciated against the US dollar
For the year as a whole, it is expected that bank loans and investments will post mild growth
In the future, the Bank will continue reviewing the status of banks real estate lending  and the effectiveness of the Banks credit control measures, closely monitor potential  impacts of real estate sector-related policies on the housing market, and adjust the  measures  as  needed  in  order  to  promote  financial  stability  and  sound  banking  operations
With the Banks Special Accommodation Facility set to close soon, a further 25 basis-point rate hike would weigh on the services sector as well as the SMEs
On the other hand, though, this is neither the right time to begin a rate hike cycle, considering the absence of an overheating risk or strong growth momentum
In  regard  to  inflation,  elevated  services  prices  in  major  economies  had  led  to  a  slower  decline  in  core  inflation,  causing  the  disinflation  progress  to  stall
In view of this assessment, it  would be appropriate not to raise the policy rates
One director cited  the forecasts of the US headline and core price indices for personal consumption expenditures  PCE, released after the Federal Open Market Committees FOMC June Meeting, and pointed  out that US inflation could climb higher this year before declining next year
Two board directors noted that the Bank had adjusted the control measures twice since December 2020; they hoped this adjustment would also be well-received by the market
With respect to internal demand, private investment was expected to sustain growth  with  tech  firms  increasing  capital  outlay,  major  investment  projects    such  as  green  energy  and  government-supported  infrastructure  development    moving  along,  and  maritime and air transporters procuring new equipment
One board director noted that staple prices continued to face considerable upside  pressures, and energy prices, of which the rising costs had been absorbed by state-owned  oil and electricity enterprises i.e., the CPC and Taipower, could drive up prices after  the  electricity  tariffs  are  hiked  in  April
The primary points to this amendment are as follows Appendix 1      1  Granting no grace period to a natural persons first outstanding home loan when  the borrower already owns buildings to hisher name
Exports to all major destination economies, especially South Korea, China, and ASEAN, registered positive growth
This is aimed at preventing such borrowers from  using financial leverages for speculative homebuying and reinforcing banks  credit risk management
Second, while the unemployment rate has dropped to a recent low, the common phenomenon of low wages suggested that slack remained in the labor market
One board director noted that although  recent declines in  animal  feed costs took  pork prices lower, price stickiness would prevent related food-away-from-home prices  from decreasing correspondingly
Looking ahead, the global economy still faces downside risks, including 1 long-term scars to potential output of major economies as capital stock and labor force are constrained by the pandemic; 2 escalation in US-China trade tensions; 3 a worsening in financial fragilities as the necessary policy responses to the pandemic, such as large fiscal stimulus and ultra-loose monetary policy, aggravate the debt burdens of governments and firms
Meanwhile, the negative output gap and insufficient aggregate demand might create downward pressures on prices
The marked rebound in international raw material prices this year drove up prices of imports  and goods for domestic sales, stepping up pressures of imported inflation
Another board director noted that the effectiveness of the selective credit  controls was hampered by the liquidity flush in the domestic market
For this year as a whole, the Bank forecasts the CPI and core CPI annual growth rates to be -0.20 and 0.24, respectively Appendix Table 2
Nevertheless, the reserve requirement adjustment has not been frequently deployed, and the effect of such policy implementation on bank excess reserves and market interest rates would need to be closely monitored
Based on the assessment of domestic and international economic and financial conditions and prospects, the Board Directors all expressed approval of keeping policy rates unchanged
In  addition,  the  pace  of  Chinas  economic  recovery,  climate change, and geopolitical risks could weigh on commodity prices,  increasing uncertainties over global inflation trends
Such high concentration implied that Taiwans exports are vulnerable to changes in one or several particular industries or markets
For instance, private investment is forecast to expand faster in the coming three quarters from the second quarter onwards than last year, and the governments Forward-looking Infrastructure Development Program is also expected to propel growth in public and private investment this year
In terms of bank credit, as the annual growth rate of housing loans had picked up  since  the  second  half  of  2023  and  Taiwans  export  growth  stabilized  in  the  fourth  quarter, bank loans and investments gradually rose to an annual pace of 6.58 by the  end of 2023
Nevertheless, the director cautioned that  prices  of  services  continued  to  rise  markedly  and,  like  core  inflation,  tend  to  resist  downward change; it was important to prevent inflation expectations from firming up
We  will  also  monitor  the  results  of  the  regulations  and  measures  introduced  and  make  timely  adjustments  to  the  relevant measures as warranted
As the domestic economic upswing bolstered labor market conditions, employment increased and the unemployment rate dropped further
It was expected that exports  and  private  investment  would  both  post  negative  real  growth  this  year
Taiwans  Manufacturing  PMI  climbed  to  expansion  territory,  with  the  six-month  outlook  subindex  pointing  to  expansion  for  the  fourth  consecutive  month
For  next  year,  international institutions expected global oil prices to be steady; meanwhile, domestic  services inflation would likely continue with a gradual downtrend
For instance, exports of non-AI servers and mobile  phones  were  tepid
As real estate developers were keen on buying more land, the ensuing land price hikes also pushed up housing prices
For the first two months of the year, excess reserves  of banks averaged around NT54.9 billion
As mentioned, the domestic market interest rates have remained steady
In addition, such a tool would  require a massive scale to meaningfully affect housing market trends
In this  economic context, it would be necessary for the Bank to maintain its policy stance with  further  rate  hikes
By  contrast,  after  the  pandemic  concerns  receded, pent-up demand was released briskly, sending private consumption growth to  a  33-year  high  in  the  second  quarter  of  2023
Against this backdrop, stable monetary policy will provide some predictability for firms and investors in their investment decisions and thus galvanize domestic investment, which justifies keeping the policy rates unchanged for the time being
Another board director noted that the import price index in US dollar terms dropped  in the Jan.-Aug. period; in NT dollar terms, the index also fell despite NTD weakness  vis-à-vis  the  USD
Since the  Board  met in December  last  year, the global  manufacturing and services  sectors  have  witnessed  faster  growth,  and  trade  activity  has  gradually  recovered
As a result, the annual growth rate of domestic  banks loans and investments rose, with loans to small and medium-sized  enterprises  SMEs also expanding
One board director noted that strong housing demand was insufficiently met owing  to shortfalls in new projects for sale and new housing starts
In regard to domestic demand, growth in private investment would benefit from the  execution of deferred investment plans this year, and from further investment promises  by  major  chipmakers  and  semiconductor  supply-chain  firms  in  order  to  maintain  a  leading  edge  as  well  as  by  the  corporate  sector  moving  towards  net-zero  energy  transition
Therefore, the cut should be considered in a broader context, including accounting for the aforementioned interest rate spread and short-term capital issues
Data showed that there had been a large number of new borrowers taking out  their second outstanding housing loans, representing a share of about 17 in  the second quarter of 2024
Unabated  supply-demand  imbalance  owing  to  supply  chain  bottlenecks  and  the  Ukraine  war-induced  price  surges  amid  disrupted  supply  and  exportation  of  raw  materials exerted heavy pressures on global inflation, leading international institutions  to revise this years global inflation forecasts upwards
Another board director noted that since housing rents have a large weight among the CPI  basket, attention should be paid to whether housing price rises also lead to rent increases
Another board director also supported the adjustments, stating that the housing price trends  at present reflected a combination of supply-side and demand-side factors and the Bank would  need to demonstrate its resolve to keep the housing market from overheating
Board Directors expressed their opinions on the impact of exchange rate and stock price movements on financial conditions
Regarding the international economic situation, one Board Director expressed the view that though a global economic pickup is expected for this year, the longer-term growth trend is still weak
It is expected that the combined efforts would work in concert to promote steady growth for the Taiwan economy
From  the  beginning  of  this  year,  continuously  buoyant  demand  for  electronic  parts  and  components  and  information  and  communication  products,  as  well  as  stronger  sales  of  traditional manufacturing merchandise, boosted Taiwans export growth substantially
The Board decided unanimously to keep the policy rates on hold  At  the  meeting  today,  the  Board  considered  the  totality  of  economic  and  financial  conditions  at home and  abroad
Both  retail  and  foodbeverage  sectors  witnessed  the  strongest  sales  in  history  during  the  Jan.-Jul
In addition, the hikes in  minimum wage and public sector employee pay may spur wage increases for workers in the  private sector
Taiwans forecasts for CPI and core CPI to drop below 2 in 2023 already consider potential power tariff increases
Several board directors discussed the developments in the domestic housing market
Regarding  private  consumption,  post-pandemic  consumer  sentiment  for  travel  would  likely  remain  high,  while  household  disposable  income  would  gain  from  a  minimum wage hike, a public sector pay-raise, and a further rise in the income tax-free  basic living expenses allowance
Manufacturing and non- manufacturing sentiment for the outlook for the next six months also became cautious
Exports to Taiwans  major trading partners also registered a broad uptrend
During the first eight months of the year, the annual growth rate of the CPI averaged  2.32  mainly  owing  to  rising  food  prices  such  as  fruit  and  food  away  from  home,  housing  rent  hikes,  and  price  rises  in  personal  effects,  entertainment  services,  and  medical  fees,  which  combined  to  contribute  1.75  percentage  points,  or  about  75,  to  the rise in the CPI annual growth rate
One board director pointed out that although the 0.25 percentage point cut was in line with an assessment of the current economic disruption, the Bank could face renewed rate cut pressures if the coronavirus outbreak persists
Taiwans economy is projected to  exhibit strong growth this year, albeit with divergence among different sectors, and is also  expected to post solid growth next year as the global economic recovery continues onwards  amid potential downside risks
One  board  director  stated  that  continued  rate  hikes  by  various  central  banks  to  contain  inflation  had  inhibited  global  economic  growth
In addition, US-China trade negotiations are likely to achieve positive results, and global financial markets have rebounded significantly
Demand for currency increased prior to the Lunar New Year Holidays, which fell  in February this year
For next year, private consumption was  forecasted to grow mildly, with disposable income to be boosted by a scheduled hike in  the minimum wage and public sector pay next year and stronger corporate willingness  to raise pay thanks to stronger profits in the first half of this year
The domestic inflation rate would  gradually  come  down  this  year  from  the  levels  of  last  year  and  is  expected  to  decline  to  around  2  next  year
Banks average excess reserves stayed above NT60 billion
Policy Proposition To keep the discount rate, the rate on accommodations with collateral, and the rate on accommodations without collateral unchanged at 1.375, 1.75, and 3.625, respectively
As lockdowns and travel bans restricted the movement of goods and people, merchandise costs would increase and commodity exports and imports would be obstructed, both of which could push up domestic prices
One board director pointed to the spillover effect of the US monetary easing policy having a world-wide impact and noted that a small open economy like Taiwan would be especially vulnerable
The CBC forecasts CPI and core inflation for 2017 to rise 0.80 and 1.04 year on year, respectively
Considering  the above benefits and a higher base effect, the Bank projected that real private investment  would grow at a mild pace next year
Nonetheless, when  seasonal or irregular factors such as massive inflows or outflows of short-term capital lead to  excess  volatility  and  disorderly  movements  in  the  NT  dollar  exchange  rate  with  adverse  implications for economic and financial stability, the Bank, in line with its statutory mandates,  will step in to maintain an orderly market
Reviews  and  rectifications  will  then  be  conducted  after  some  time  into  the  policy  implementation,  with  a  focus  on  comprehensiveness and an understanding of specific cases
1 The domestic inflation slowdown was projected to continue, with the annual growth  rates of CPI and core CPI both forecasted to be 2.09
The  director  therefore  supported  the  proposition  to  raise  the  policy  rates  by  25  basis  points
Nevertheless,  effects  of  monetary tightening by major economies and unrelenting geopolitical conflicts  continued  to  hamper  global  economic  growth  momentum
Several board directors discussed economic uncertainties lying ahead and a wider US-Taiwan interest rate differential, and stated that the Banks monetary policy conduct should be more nimble
In the year to date, growth in banks  construction and housing loans continued to slow, real estate lending as a share of  total lending has broadly held steady, and the level of non-performing loan ratio for  real estate lending has stayed low
In addition, the relatively mild inflation in Taiwan was mainly supported by utility oil, electricity, natural gas, etc
Lowering the LTV ratio ceiling on mortgage loans for idle land in industrial districts to  50; stipulating that the well-defined period of time for the relevant exemptions to  apply shall be one year
Discussion on domestic and international economic and financial conditions In respect of the external environment, one board director noted that since the end of February international forecasting institutions and investment banks have actually adjusted their views on the global economic outlook given the Feds rate hike pause and a milder-than-expected slowdown in China thanks to Beijings massive stimulus measures
Private  investment,  whose  growth  has  long  been  highly  correlated  with  exports,  could  fare  poorly  this  year;  the  Bank  expected  private  investment  to  show  negative  growth in 2023 in consequence of sluggish export growth, ongoing inventory  adjustments, and cautious business outlook sentiment
Moreover, the Bank had bucked the trend for several years by keeping the rates unchanged when other central banks eased
Overall,  the  Bank  projected  exports  to  post  solid  growth this year and slower growth next year
Discussion on domestic and international economic and financial conditions Several board directors gave views on the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on Taiwans macroeconomic and price conditions
With regard to domestic demand, private investment  gained stronger momentum with capital equipment imports increasing  significantly  in recent  months, and private consumption continued growing
In  terms  of  economic  growth,  the  global  recovery  remains  on  track,  though  still  facing  multiple uncertainties
Spillover effect of Chinas economic slowdown,  and  global  economic fragmentations and supply chain restructuring, could all affect trade,  economic, and financial development of the  world
Domestic  inflation  is  expected  to  come down moderately in the second half of the year, bringing the inflation rate to  around 2 in the fourth quarter
Among international commodities, sharp declines in crude prices have exerted a downward pressure on global inflation
Recent data pointed to little change in domestic economic and financial conditions; combined with the Feds aggressive rate hikes, it would seem more fitting for the Bank to raise the policy rates by 25 basis points
Meanwhile, given the US-China  trade conflict, some supply chains could shift out of China, driving production costs upwards
The  Banks  survey  for  inflation  expectations  found  that,  compared  to  the  previous  quarter,  a  larger  share  of  respondents  in  the  corporate  sector  and  in  investment  trust  companies  expected  the  annual CPI growth rate to exceed 2, mainly because of international raw material price  rises and domestic price hikes by some firms
These have all exerted downward pressures on interest rates
This board director explained further in regard to M2 growth
One board director pointed to tepid exports and private investment and cautioned  that these sectors  remained  mired in negative growth despite some  signs of recovery
The Bank of Japan moved towards monetary policy  normalization,  and  the  Peoples  Bank  of  China  continued  with  its  accommodative  monetary policy stance
Survey data on inflation expectations showed more corporate respondents anticipating inflation above 2.5 within 12 months, reflecting rising international raw material prices and domestic price hikes
In terms of bank credit, with home mortgages and personal working capital loans  continuing to rise year on year since May 2024 and the corporate sector also showing  greater  funding demand amid steady  export growth,  the annual growth rate of banks  loans and investments rose month by month during the  year, averaging 7.73 for the  first eight months of 2024
Discussions regarding the policy rate decision  One board director pointed out that the domestic economy was gradually firming  up, and inflation continued with a broad downtrend without an expected surge following  the April electricity tariff hike
For the outlook of the second half of the year, with services inflation easing further,  the Bank expects the inflation rate to gradually come down in the second half of the  year
One board director pointed out that following the policy launch, the  Bank  will  strive  to  address  problems  and  difficulties
In the first half of this year, substantial foreign capital inflows have brought about an upsurge in foreign currency supply, resulting in NT dollar appreciation against the US dollar
The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war pushed up international raw material prices
Removing  the  grace  period  for  a  second  home  loan  taken  out  by  a  natural  person  for  housing located in the stipulated specific areas, namely Taipei City, New Taipei City,  Taoyuan  City,  Taichung  City,  Tainan  City,  Kaohsiung  City,  Hsinchu  County,  and  Hsinchu City
Meanwhile, a rate hike increases  funding costs, likely hindering corporate investment, exports, and private consumption
Taiwan has recently witnessed frequent short-term capital movements with adverse implications for the domestic forex and stock markets
The growth rate stood at 6.75 at the end of October and averaged 7.55 for the first ten months of the year
The Bank forecasted the domestic economy to expand by 1.92 this year, lower by 0.65 percentage points from the previous forecast in December 2019
In  this  light,  a  rate  hold  would be the sensible decision that would allow the Bank to pause for new information  such as the lagged effect of monetary tightening and take stock of a need for future rate  adjustments
Moreover, international prices of crude oil and other raw materials trended downward
As major economies such as the US and Europe still recorded high inflation and many central banks significantly tightened monetary policy, global economic growth is expected to slow further in 2023, with the US and Europe likely entering mild recessions
This could lead to deterioration  in asset quality
Average bank excess reserves stood at around NT70 billion
For small open economies like Taiwan, it has always been a difficult task to manage  inflation, as demonstrated by the effects of international crude oil price fluctuations on domestic  prices
Regarding labor market conditions in recent  months, job gains continued, the unemployment rate came lower than a year  ago, and nominal wage increased mildly
Inflationary pressures would be mild, given a slight moderation in the domestic economy and still below-potential output
This Director pointed out that co-movements between stock prices and exchange rates could create risks
The Bank projects that in 2021 the CPI and core CPI annual growth rates would rise to 0.92 and 0.62 respectively, noting the global economic recovery, higher oil prices as anticipated by international forecasters, and mild consumption demand at home
Given  the current economic and financial situation, the director supported a 25 bps rate hike  and  suggested  to  continue  monitoring  the  Feds  rate  path,  global  economic  developments, and domestic price trends while prudently formulating monetary policy
In terms of a rate cut, given the historically low levels  of the policy rates at present, the room and the effect of a reduction would be very limited
Therefore, selective credit control would be the right way to foster a sound real estate market
A rate cut decision this time would imply less room for future policy maneuver
Considering  that  real  estate-related  lending  still  takes  up  a  large  proportion  in  bank credit, the director agreed with the proposition to adjust selective credit controls  and to hike the RRRs in order to promote financial stability
Another board director pointed out that most major economies have kept  their policy rates unchanged since April this year in order to buttress the economic recovery
In respect of domestic demand, private investment grew at a slower pace mainly  because  raw  material  shortfalls  resulted  in  an  extension  of  equipment  delivery  time,  while labor shortage and inventory adjustments as well as a cautious economic outlook  prompted some firms to postpone capital expenditure plans
In terms of grain  prices, this  year had so far witnessed a downtrend as weather conditions in Argentine  and  US  crop  areas  improved  and  the  Black  Sea  grain  export  deal  was  extended
The  Bank  successively  met  with  a  total  of  34  domestic  banks  between  August  12  and  August  21
Furthermore, in the fourth quarter of 2020, more than half  at 54.51  of non-real estate and non-construction  related  corporations  sold  houses  within  one  year  of  purchase
Compared  to  the  projections  made in March 2024, the Bank upgraded the forecast of Taiwans 2024 GDP growth  rate by 0.55 percentage points, reflecting both a higher-than-expected GDP growth rate  in 2024 Q1 but also the Banks upward revision of the contribution from net external  demand and private investment to the 2024 GDP growth rate
Most  countries, including the U.S. and Japan, use the rental equivalence approach; their rent  is generally less susceptible to housing price changes, showing a more stable trend with  little deviation from the CPI
2 The global economy is shrouded in many uncertainties
Looking ahead, the global economy would have to move forward in a sea of uncertainties  likely  to  arise  from  1  a  significant  lack  of  effective  mass  vaccination;  2  rising  yields  on  longer-term bonds of major economies, which could cause financial conditions to tighten; 3  financial  fragilities  exacerbating  further  as  the  pandemic  aggravates  existing  inequality,  productivity slack, and debt burdens; 4 lingering global economic and trade uncertainties over  such  issues  as  US-China  relations,  as  well  as  unabated  climate  change  risks
Furthermore, the Bank had previously introduced the control measure of allowing no grace  periods for a second housing loan in eight specific areas. Should the real estate market remain  heated, more targeted prudential measures could be deployed to rein it in
Many  major central banks continued to raise their policy  rates to  tackle inflation whereas some economies still kept an accommodative monetary policy  stance or even reduced rates
For the first seven months of the year, the unemployment rate averaged 3.76, decreasing by 0.15 percentage points compared to the same period last year
Private consumption, on the other hand, was forecasted to continue expanding in  real  terms  as  the  domestic  economic  recovery  bolstered  consumer  confidence,  along  with brisk trading in the stock market
Price trends of international crude oil since early November 2021 showed a decline from  previous highs as oil demand was hampered by the U.S. efforts to increase local oil output and  by market concerns that the new variants could result in a fresh round of major outbreaks
Another board director stated that a widened output gap, which indicated deficient growth momentum and subdued inflation, and the likely year-long pause of rate hikes by the Fed gave little ground for Taiwan to raise policy rates
Meanwhile, both long- and short-term market interest rates slipped slightly downwards in recent months
Major stock markets  experienced  turbulence  in  recent  months  in  response  to  U.S.  inflation  data  and  Fed  policy paths
One board director pointed out that structural factors holding down global inflation have weakened somewhat
As the pandemic raged through the world, most economies saw steep cuts to their domestic growth forecasts, with the United States, the euro area, and Japan recently projected by international forecasters to register negative growth
Meanwhile, core CPI i.e.,  excluding  fruit  and  vegetables  and  energy  items  increased  by  2.57  year  on  year, abating rather slowly mainly because prices of foodbeverage and  travelaccommodation  services  were  buttressed  by  booming  demand  amid  the  post- pandemic reopening period
As for projections, the Bank expected to see extended growth  in real exports next year on account of robust development of emerging technology  applications, new capacity for advanced semiconductor production, and increased production  in Taiwan as firms re-distribute production plans
As  to  private  consumption,  tightened  containment  measures  in  response  to  the  domestic  COVID-19  flareup  restrained  consumer  spending  from  mid-May  onwards
If  inflation  shows  any hint of becoming unanchored by the next Board Meeting, the Bank should take a  stronger approach to contain inflation
In  addition, some banks might be caught ill-prepared upon an RRR hike, potentially putting  the Bank in a position  to provide  liquidity  as  seen fit
Such  policy measures include increasing the supply of social housing, raising the relevant tax levies,  etc
In this view, further US dollar strength would be on the horizon, as evident in the fact that the US dollar appreciated soon after the Feds announcement of the asset reduction plan
In addition, given Taiwans large trade surplus and foreign capital inflows, small capital outflows could help let out pressures of a domestic market flush with liquidity
The director therefore supported the proposed decision to not adjust  the policy rates
Several Board Directors also pointed out that monetary policy decisions should take into account both current inflationary pressures and the future inflation outlook
Recently,  residential rent seemed to be trending upwards,  and that uptrend was indicated by the  DGBAS CPI data using a compilation approach in line with the international principles
A noticeable improvement in global trade activity was evident in a strong rebound of the  WTO Goods Trade Barometer
Moreover, Taiwans nominal and real interest rates continue to register around the middle range among a host of economies Appendix Figure 1  Table 2
Major foreign stock indices generally rallied from June onwards
Meanwhile, domestic  demand was still sound in contrast to softening external demand
The domestic COVID-19 resurgence since mid-April caused companies to institute more furloughs, and consumers shied away from dining out and travel
Overall, the Bank expected the economy to be encumbered by the corornavirus outbreak for the first half of 2020 as manufacturing supply chains and the service sector were hampered
Meanwhile, recent developments in US inflation and the  Feds  monetary  policy  stance  have  sparked  a  drastic  increase  in  volatility  in  international financial markets
With public and private investment expected to grow faster than last year and private consumption to expand steadily, domestic demand would continue to be the main driving force behind this years economic growth
In addition, compared with recent data of other economies, Taiwans real  housing  price  index  seemed  to  have  a  relatively  lower  annual  growth  rate;  however,  Taiwan ranked higher than most countries in terms of accumulated growth in housing  prices in the past 20 years
Furthermore, several board directors also approved of keeping rates steady, taking into account the trajectory of monetary policies in major economies
The annual growth rate of bank loans and investments averaged 5.70 for the same period as bank lending to private enterprises continued increasing
Firms are building up production capacity with greater investment in machinery and equipment as the global economy strengthens
Based  on  the  assessments  thereof, the Bank may  adjust its  monetary  policy timely and appropriately to fulfill  the statutory duties of maintaining price stability, safeguarding financial stability, and  fostering economic development
For the year as a whole, international institutions expected global economic growth to moderate
Since  the  Board  met  in  December  last  year,  the  coronavirus  COVID-19  pandemic  has  gradually been brought under control, leading to a gradual recovery in global economic and  trade  activities,  coupled  with  an  uptrend  in  international  crude  oil  and  other  commodity  prices
This also showed  that labor market conditions were picking up
Moreover, in recent months, the number of employed persons and the amount  of  overtime  hours  worked  both  continued  decreasing  in  the  manufacturing  sector  but  rose further in the services sector
In light of anticipated slowing in global economic and trade activity this year and a higher base last year, export growth may decelerate in 2019
Current inflationary pressures and expected inflation are both mild
In terms of annual changes in the number of employed persons, the  manufacturing sector posted a further decrease in October while the services sector saw  an  increase
One of these directors pointed out that  upon the June 2023 introduction of this LTV ratio cap, a supplementary policy measure  was  implemented  concurrently  to  exempt  home-movers  within  a  one-year  window  conditional upon signed affidavits
The Banks tightening measures since March amplified the effectiveness of these controls
There  has  been  a  divergence  in  economic  growth  across  major  economies
Firms also expressed optimism about the outlook in the coming six months
Developments  since  the  Board  met  in  December  2022  pointed  to  tepid  growth  momentum  in  advanced  economies,  while  policy  rates  could  stay  high  for  some  time  owing to elevated inflationary pressures
Currently, Taiwans inflation is not much a cause for concern
One board director noted that exports vital role in the economy makes Taiwan  closely interconnected with, and susceptible to, the world economy
In  addition,  housing  market trading had started to slacken since the beginning of the year as a result of the  concerted efforts under the  governments Healthy Real Estate  Market Plan as well as  the pandemics impact; given time, more results of the policy efforts are expected to  show
Another board director stated that M2 continues to serve as an important reference for  monetary policy deliberation
In  this  view,  the  Board  judged  that  a  rate  hold  would  help  sustain  price  and  financial  stability  and  foster  economic growth
The following uncertainties are expected to surround the global economic  and financial outlook 1 The duration of high policy rates adopted by major central  banks, 2 Chinas economic downturn, and 3 global economic fragmentation and  supply chain restructuring, all of which could dampen the momentum for the world  to achieve an economic recovery
Greater final demand benefiting from the gradual normalization of economic activity in major economies was expected to keep Taiwans exports enjoying solid real growth in the second half of 2021, with significant expansion for the year as a whole before moderating next year
The solution would therefore be to guide insurers to invest more in real economic activity
Rising prices for agricultural products and energy items could further exacerbate inflation next year
With  interest  rates  staying  low  for  a  long  while,  speculators  seeking  short-term  gains  and  first-time  homebuyers  wary  of  price  surges scrambled to buy houses, creating a vicious loop that could be exacerbated if low  rates persist longer
Furthermore, the annual growth rate of  construction loans also picked up, reaching 5.0 at the end of August
In addition, the higher-than-usual price rises at home in the  recent year could push up inflation expectations
The policy measures have so far effectively helped banks mitigate  credit  risk  associated  with  real  estate  lending,  reflected  by  steady  slowdown  in  banks construction and housing loan growth and the continuously low level of the  non-performing loan ratio for real estate lending
The  Bank forecasts that Taiwans economy would expand by 4.53 in 2021 Appendix Table 1
Assessed against economic conditions, some of those economies enjoy higher GDP growth than Taiwan while recording a relatively lower negative real interest rate when compared with Taiwan
Based on the estimations of the money demand function, the annual growth rate of M2 demand will remain between 2.5 and 6.5 next year
Meanwhile, although prices of some household paper products hiked to factor in international pulp price movements, and electricity rates are to be raised from April onwards to reflect higher costs of fuel imports for power generation, these factors only made a modest influence on the overall price trend
Despite a recent downtrend  in  the  30-day  commercial  paper  rate,  future  developments  in  the  money  markets  still  require  monitoring
Nonetheless, this does not mean the Bank should write off interest rate policy completely but consider a policy mix of macroprudential measures and interest rate adjustment when warranted
In terms of credit support to help counter the economic impact of the pandemic, there were relief loan programs for both employers and employees implemented by the government
Though the selective credit  controls had proved effective to an extent, they could only treat the symptoms but not the  disease; the housing price malady cannot be cured without a targeted therapy against loose  monetary policy
Considering a slowdown in inflation next year, moderation in economic growth, and already high levels of bank loans and investments, M2 growth is expected to return to the 2.5-6.5 reference range in the second half of 2023
On  the  other  hand,  sources  of  downside  pressures included 1 declines in communication devices prices and communications  rates; 2 the governments potential reduction of tax rates for commodity tax, customs  duty, and business tax, helping to mitigate rising cost pressures for firms
As the domestic pandemic cases diminished, the housing market also witness a  rebound in transaction volume as well as a price rally
One Board Director also noted that the positive effect of the public sector wage increase on private consumption could be offset by a contraction effect as civil servants might tighten their purse strings on concern over reduced income post retirement following the pension reform
In  addition,  the  domestic  economy  is  expected  to  continue expanding at a moderate pace both for the second half o f this year  and  for  next  year,  with  a  modestly  negative  output  gap  for  both  years
In this light, it is advisable to include longer-term factors in the Banks monetary policy decision-making in the future
Although economic expansion remained steady, indicators like the business climate monitor and leading indicators signaled high uncertainties
In view of these risk  concerns and a higher base effect this year 2021, it was expected that major economies would  register slower growth in 2022 compared to 2021
The director  pointed out that the dynamics between some of these factors and inflation trends have changed
In respect of business sentiment, Taiwans leading and coincident indicators for business  cycles recorded consecutive rises in recent months, against a backdrop of the increasing  domestic vaccination rate and gradual easing of containment measures, along with continued  export strength
In this regard, this board director suggested the  Bank consider adjusting the acceptable range for the annual CPI growth rate to a band higher  than 0-2  One board director noted that inflation has different effects on individuals and households  across different income classes because inflation is the most regressive tax of all
Among  major  economies,  growth  was  uneven  The  US  economy  advanced  steadily,  the  euro  area and the UK sputtered, Japan posted mild growth, and China saw greater risk of an  economic slowdown
One board director presented two points of views regarding the future development of domestic economic growth
Nevertheless, considering subdued global inflation expectations, falling oil prices, and soft domestic demand, the CBC forecasts CPI and core CPI inflation for 2017 to rise 1.07 and 1.11 year on year, respectively, reflecting a stable inflation outlook
Therefore, the director supported a 0.125  percentage point rate hike in the hope of containing inflation expectations
Meanwhile, homebuyer sentiment seemed to be dampened recently as the governments  housing  market  policies  gradually  showed  results
Meanwhile, real  estate lending as a percentage of total bank lending had remained stable
Despite the fact that recent NTD weakness was mainly caused by foreign portfolio investment outflows, more downward pressures on the currency could ensue if a wider US-Taiwan interest rate differential induces more capital outflows
Another board director stated that the Bank should closely monitor the changes in the housing market and would better act preemptively before public expectations of home-price rises become palpable
The Banks selective credit control measures, implemented through four amendments since December 2020, have bolstered credit risk management in the banking sector
In terms of labor market conditions, the overall unemployment rate  dropped,  yet  the  number  of  furloughed  employees  in  the  manufacturing  sector  increased
For 2021 as a whole, the Bank  forecasts the CPI and core CPI annual growth rates to be 1.70 and 1.17, respectively  Appendix Table 2
Major  economies  had  begun  reopening  from  the  coronavirus  COVID-19  lockdown  and  continued  with  macro  support  policies,  boosting  consumption  and  investment  demand
One board director stated that maintaining the current policy rate levels would be appropriate, and that policy rate adjustments generally serve two purposes
In addition, as the US Fed and other central banks in  major  economies  began  to  reduce  monetary  policy  accommodation,  the  global  economy this year is expected to grow at a slower pace
While a rate hike is warranted, stronger arguments exist for a 0.25 percentage point hike
Nevertheless,  uncertainties  still  abounded  for  price  trends and economic activity; in the future, the Board could still consider adjusting the  policy rates if deemed necessary
Meanwhile, other economies in Asia either maintained or reduced their policy rates
One board director viewed that maintaining low rates at home should be in order given lingering uncertainties over the global economy
One board director shared that  the Bank noticed a continuous increase in banks  real estate loans with a large balance as a percentage  of total  loans
Meanwhile, the international economic outlook is  confronted  by  many  uncertainties,  the  domestic  output  gap  would  likely  turn  negative,  and  the  domestic  economy  is  projected  to  grow  at  a  slower  pace  than  previously forecasted
Then,  intensifying  conflicts  in  Ukraine  pushed up hedging demand and led the US dollar index to rise sharply and fluctuate at  elevated levels
Regarding  monthly  earnings,  total  nominal  earnings  posted  faster growth, averaging 3.62 for the first four months of the year
On  the  other  hand,  faltering  final  demand  amid  a  slowing  global  economic  expansion  and  the  ensuing  inventory  adjustment  by  some  firms  have  exerted  a  drag  on  Taiwans  export  growth  and  private investment
Therefore,  with  the  aim  of  stemming  an  inordinately  high  flow  of  bank  credit  into the real estate sector and further reining in credit risk of such lending, the Bank decided  to introduce the following amendments Appendix, effective March 19, 2021           1 Lowering the LTV ratio cap on housing loans extended to corporate entities capped  at 40
The Bank managed market liquidity and helped keep bank reserves at an adequate level, and the overnight call loan rate of the banking sector was also steady
In  terms  of  external  demand,  emerging  technology  application  and  traditional  manufacture continued enjoying strong demand, leading exports of major products and  exports  to  major  trading  partners  to  expand  by  more  than  10  for  the  year  to  date
The Bank projected solid export growth for the year as a whole
The pandemic-hit domestically-oriented services sector gradually rebounded, and  labor market conditions steadily resumed the levels before the mid-2021 domestic  COPVID-19 flare-up
In this view, the board director supported the proposed rate hold
One board director pointed out that, given the scale of Taiwans investment in and merchanting trade particularly intermediate goods trade with China over the years since 2000, we are highly integrated into the global value chain
The annual growth rate edged up in August,  though, buoyed by greater demand of government enterprises for funding
For  the year as a whole, the CPI and core CPI inflation rates were forecasted to be 2.22  and 2.44, respectively, lower than last years 2.95 and 2.61
Overall, the Bank forecasted Taiwans economy to expand by 3.22 year on year  in  2024,  higher  than  1.31  of  2023,  based  on  the  expectation  of  exports  and  private  investment  resuming positive  growth  and private  consumption continuing  rising
With  the  fed  funds  rate  expected to stay elevated, major stock markets in the world recorded weaker rallies, the  US dollar index swung high, and major currencies broadly depreciated against the US  dollar
In regard to the key determinants of future price trends, upside pressures could stem from 1 a minimum wage hike implemented early in the year, which would drive up prices in services, and 2 faster rises in food prices including fruit and vegetables, owing to a lower base effect from last years favorable weather conditions
In the foreign  exchange market, the US dollar index trended up as investors expecting a faster rate hike  cycle  of  the  Fed  turned  to  US  dollar  assets
Considering these and a higher base effect in the second half of the year, the pace of the economic recovery may moderate slightly
Growth projections by major institutions ranged between 2.77 and 4.50
Taking  into  account  the  relatively  milder  inflation in Taiwan compared to major economies, and the slower pace of the Feds rate  hike  by  only  0.25  percentage  points  yesterday  March  22,  the  director  supported  the  proposition of raising the policy rates by 0.125 percentage points
Several board directors gave their views about the requirement that land loan borrowers  should commit to begin construction work within a specific time frame
With regard to lending rates, one board director gave the view that whether the lenders are state-owned banks or private ones, the aid efforts were not designed to make them take losses
Since  the  Board  met  in  June  this  year,  the  cumulative  effects  of  significant  policy  rate  hikes  by  major  central  banks  in  the  US  and  Europe  since  2022  have continued to work through the economy
Furthermore, Taiwans nominal and real interest rates were still around the middle range compared to selected economies
Meanwhile,  the  long-term  government  bond  yields  in  major  economies  declined, the US dollar index fell from its peak levels, and major currencies broadly  appreciated against the US dollar
Against this  background, the Board judged that a rate hold would help foster sound economic and  financial development on the whole
As  the M2 annual growth rate had continued to overshoot the reference range this year so far, it  would be important to examine if this also reflected significant growth in bank loans, especially  real estate loans, and to find out if the Banks selective credit controls helped restrain the  expansion of banks real estate lending
The domestic COVID-19 case surge from mid-April slowed private consumption significantly, disrupting recovery in domestically-oriented services
While inflation and expectations are not as severe in Taiwan, exports have contracted for three consecutive months due to slowing global demand and inventory adjustments
In respect  of the electricity tariff hike, it would not only have a direct impact but also create a chain  reaction by pushing up costs across business sectors; for example, electricity-intensive  industries  could  pass  the  increased  bill  costs  to  consumers
Looking ahead, the global economy  faces  multiple downside risks, including the  following 1 Aggressive tightening by major central banks including the Fed and the  ECB,  roiling  global  financial  markets  and  depressing  economic  activity  worldwide,  heightening the risk of defaults by countries with high levels of external debt; 2 the  Russia-Ukraine  war  continuing  on,  taking  a  toll  on  the  European  economy  amid  the  resulting energy crisis and hurting political and economic stability amid financial market  turbulence; 3 Chinas zero-COVID policy posing a threat to the easing of global  supply  chain  bottlenecks,  and  the  real  estate  market  pressures  destabilizing  global  financial stability
This shaped a more acute sense of price rises in  staple items among consumers
Hurricane disruptions to oil production in the Gulf of Mexico in late August, as well as market expectations of a demand rebound as the pandemic eased, pushed international oil prices back upwards
Bank lending rates, including those on adjustable rate mortgages, would change in tandem
However, the Bank should  not be discouraged by the limited results but rather carried on with what should be done
It was projected that global economic growth would  soften  this  year,  with  international  institutions  downgrading  their  forecasts  for  the  worlds GDP growth rate in 2022 and expecting a further slowdown in 2023
Housing transactions in the six Special Municipalities increased moderately in the first eight months compared to the same period last year
Looking  into  the  second  half  of  the  year,  private  consumption  will  likely  continue  with mild growth, while a rebound in global final demand and the ever-brightening  business prospects of emerging tech applications are both expected to buttress export  growth momentum and boost private investment
As  for  the  issue  of  a  negative  real  interest  rate,  if  inflation  is  successfully subdued, the real interest rate would turn positive; in contrast, if inflation  stays elevated, further rate hikes could be warranted
It is also suggested that the Bank communicate to the public that it pays great attention to not only short-term volatility but also longer-term economic growth
While headline inflation trended downwards, key staple goods and core inflation remained elevated, requiring close monitoring of inflation expectations
As the imbalance issue and elevated energy prices  expected to  continue into the first half of 2022  would likely ease afterwards, international institutions  projected a gradual decline of inflation by the end of 2022, with the inflation rate for the year  as a whole to register slightly higher than 2021
Amid expectations of a global economic recovery and  the US governments US1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus package, recent inflation expectations  in  the  US  have  strengthened  markedly,  driving  up  long-term  government  bond  yields  of  major economies, and in turn causing greater volatility in international stock markets
The global manufacturing sector has remained subdued, while the services sector has  softened
Looking ahead, the global economic and financial outlooks are clouded by multiple  uncertainties, such as the cumulative effects of monetary tightening by major central  banks and the duration of interest rates staying high,  Chinas economic  slowdown,  and fragmentation of the global economy, which could all restrain the momentum for  global economic recovery
Looking ahead, downside risks continue to loom over the global economic outlook, including uneven vaccination progress, a greater impact of new virus strains, pressures for some advanced economies to gradually withdraw monetary easing, potential disasters owing to climate change, and heightened geopolitical conflicts
Domestic inflation to come down gradually in the second half of the year, with the  inflation rate slowing to 2 in the fourth quarter    The Bank forecasted the annual growth rates of the CPI and core CPI in 2023 to be  2.24 and 2.38, respectively, lower than last years 2.95 and 2.61
Meanwhile, foreign capital showed a net inflow, the NT dollar appreciated, and Taiwans stock markets rallied
Taiwans real interest rate has reached above zero while many major economies still register negative real interest rates
Meanwhile, active business investment in the emerging applications related to the Internet of Things IoT and cloud services, among others, are also likely to fuel export growth
Monetary tightening measures have led to higher interest rates on bank deposits, loans, and money market instruments
For next  year,  the Bank projected that  a higher base  effect would result in mild real growth in private consumption
Meanwhile, recent concerns about the future courses of US  inflation and the Feds monetary policy have rattled international financial markets
One board director stated that although Taiwans often-watched housing price indices showed a slower rise in the second quarter of this year, a broad uptrend persisted, justifying the adjustment proposition
For the same period, the annual growth rate of  the core CPI averaged 2.66
However, a slowing Chinese economy, lingering world trade protectionism and a higher base effect may combine to restrict export momentum in the second half of the year
One Board Director stated that Taiwans real interest rate, though negative, was still higher than those of the US, Singapore, South Korea, and Hong Kong, while Taiwans 2017 GDP growth projections by forecasting institutions were broadly lower than these economies
In terms of export markets, exports to Taiwans major trading  destinations all recorded positive growth
The board directors decided to raise the discount rate, the rate on refinancing of  secured loans, and the rate on temporary accommodations by 0.125 percentage  points to 2, 2.375, and 4.25, respectively
Nevertheless, the zero interest rate policy of major advanced economies since the 2008 global financial crisis could have unhealthy influences on the economy in general
This concept could be described with the impossible trinity theory
One board director, in favor of both of the propositions, stated that despite steady  economic  growth,  the  National  Development  Councils Monitoring Indicator had in  recent months descended to the lower threshold of the stable signal range, the Leading  Indicators  had  trended  further  downwards,  and  exports  had  also  showed  signs  of  weakening
Against the backdrop of the domestic economic recovery and stable inflation, the CBC has continued to conduct open market operations to manage market liquidity and maintain banks excess reserves at a sufficiently accommodative level
Looking ahead, given lingering uncertainties over the US trade policies toward major economies such as China, the euro area, and Japan, a slowdown in the Chinese economy, and a possible extension of the Brexit deadline, the global economic and financial outlook remains unclear
In  particular,  the  harder-hit  services  sector saw a gradual rebound in wages and this sectors real GDP also resumed growth  thanks  to  improved  domestic  pandemic  situation
The Bank forecasted private consumption growth to gather pace
The rate hike, albeit based on a comprehensive assessment of the overall economic and financial conditions, would be helpful to some parts of the economy while undesirable to others
3 The Banks approach of simultaneously affecting price interest rate and quantity  money stock with hikes in both the policy rates and the RRRs, helping to rein in  domestic inflation expectations    A
Since the Board last met in March, economies where the coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak  came under control such as the US and Europe have gradually relaxed pandemic restrictions  while keeping monetary  and fiscal policy support in place, helping to sustain the upturn in  global economic and trade activity and bolster the prices of crude oil and other commodities
In regard to domestic demand, the Bank expected to see continued real growth in private  investment as domestic and multinational tech firms expanded their local investment plans and  major  government  spending  schemes  including  green  energy  and  5G  network  infrastructure also moved along
Nevertheless,  housing  market  transactions  began  to  climb  back  up  and  housing  prices saw steeper rises in the second half of last year, leading the annual growth rate  of housing loans to trend upwards continuously to 11.0 at the end of August this  year, the highest since May 2006
Services exports, however, were constrained by a sharp decline of inbound visitors as some of the pandemic-related border controls remained in place
In terms of the inflation outlook for the second half of the year, the recent cigarette tax hike may exert upward pressures on prices
In terms of external demand, major export products recorded across-the-board growth  thanks to growing global demand and rising international raw material prices, with the  subcategory of electronics parts and components making the greatest contribution
Looking ahead, cross-border capital movements will likely become a major influence behind Taiwans M2 growth as the global outlook is still shrouded by uncertainties and the U.S. Fed will move ahead with balance sheet reduction and rate hikes
The director emphasized that M2 is a mid- to long-term indicator and suggested allowing more time before adjusting its reference range
From the second half of 2017 to 2018, Taiwans economic growth is likely to advance with mild momentum and to remain lower than potential
In respect of monetary policy moves by major central banks, the US Fed and the  ECB held policy rates steady in the year to date
Since todays increase in policy rates was smaller than the March rate hike and the reserve requirement tool functions indirectly via the bank credit channel, adequate communication to the public about the inflation-fighting effects of todays decisions would be important for the policy to work well in containing inflation expectations
Given the domestic economic expansion under way, it seems the timing is appropriate to  gradually begin monetary policy normalization, which would also help soothe housing price  surges
The  estimates show that the CPI annual growth rates would remain above 2 in the first  three quarters of the year, before slowing to below 2 in the fourth quarter
Another board director noted that projections for investment supported the view that Taiwans economic growth in the second half of the year would outpace that in the first half
The main rationales of the downward revision included 1 both supply-side and demand-side factors resulting in the low global growth trend have not receded, and 2 long-term structural factors will require more time to resolve
In the labor market, the unemployment rate dropped to 4.24 in August, though it remained high
The Bank judged that a positive impetus from domestic demand and a lower base effect would enable Taiwans pace of economic expansion to pick up quarter by quarter in 2019, albeit not as fast as 2018 on a yearly basis
Recently, failures or financial distresses of some banks in the US and Europe had  roiled  international  financial  markets
For the months of September to October, excess reserves  of banks averaged around NT54 billion
In  the  months  since  midyear,  Taiwans  exports  have  recorded  solid  growth,  supported  by  robust  demand  for  artificial  intelligence  and  other  emerging  technology applications
More recently, despite a pickup in  investment growth last year, the pandemic-led decline in consumption also caused saving to  increase faster
Meanwhile,  with  increasing  global  demand  and  lingering  supply  chain  bottlenecks  pushing  up  international  goods  prices,  major economies have witnessed a pronounced uptick in inflation, judged by their central  banks  to  be  transitory
Regarding money supply, the M2 annual growth rate first rose before declining in  the months since February 2024, reflecting a reversal of a net foreign capital inflow into  a net outflow
Nonetheless, the annual M2 growth rate has stayed within the Banks 2.5-6.5 target range in recent years, implying sufficient support for domestic economic activity in normal circumstances
The selective credit controls aimed at mitigating the impact of housing credit on financial stability, rather than targeting housing prices directly
In  Taiwan,  the  impact  was  relatively  mild  because  domestic  banks  have  a  different  balance  sheet  structure  than  those  in  the  US  and  Europe
In principle, the NT dollar exchange rate is determined by market forces
Meanwhile,  some  central  banks  continued  with  monetary  tightening  to  combat  still-high  inflation,  while  some  others  maintained  an  accommodative  stance
Developments since the previous Board meeting in June 2017 showed that the global recovery continued at a solid pace
For  the  year  as  a  whole,  inflation  is  expected  to  rebound as import prices trend up on the back of global price recoveries for oil and other  raw  materials  and  surging  international  freight  charges
Moreover, with the domestic pandemic situation under control,  the government rolled out consumption stimulus measures, leading to an upturn in private  consumption
Therefore, the Board judged that a policy rate hold and a continued accommodative monetary policy stance will help foster sound development of the economy and the financial sector
As  inflationary  pr essures  linger  in  major  economies,  high  interest  rates  may  sustain  for  some  time
Todays new cap tightening  would not only prevent credit flows from being used for property hoarding,  but also help channel those credit towards priority use for home loans to non- homeowners

Slower growth in exports and capital equipment imports in recent months, as well as limited growth in retail sales, may put a drag on economic growth
The Bank forecasted  solid real export growth in both the second half of 2024 and the year as a whole

Export growth is likely to benefit from a firming global economy next year
By product groups, most of the leading groups registered negative growth, except for information, communications  audio-video products, and electrical machinery products
Looking  ahead,  the  global  economic  and  financial  outlooks  are  still  shrouded  in  many uncertainties, such as the duration of policy rates of major economies staying  high, the degree of tightening of global financial conditions, the pace of Chinas  economic recovery, geopolitical risks, and climate change

Our economic growth would pick up in the latter half of this year and continue to expand moderately next year with exports strengthening and domestic demand reinvigorated as the domestic COVID-19 situation remains under control
Since the Board met in June this year, growth in the US, the euro area, and China  has moderated, prices of commodities such as international crude oil have trended  downward,  and  global  supply  chain  bottlenecks  have  gradually  eased,  whereas  global inflation remains at high levels
Looking at the coming quarters, with the supply chain inventory drawdown nearing the  end,  AI-related  business  booming,  new  tech  products  hitting  the  market,  and  orders  rising for the high season, it was expected that growth in exports would see a smaller  decline in only single digits for the third quarter of 2023 and would turn positive in the  fourth quarter, albeit still in negative territory for the year as a whole
The present uptick in inflation is judged to be transitory and inflation is expected to be mild this  year
Regarding private consumption, domestic COVID-19  containment policy was eased, government measures to boost consumption were launched, and  business in the services industry  a domestically oriented sector  gradually rebounded
The  annual growth rate  of the CPI has stayed over  2 for consecutive  months and will  likely remain so towards the third quarter of the year, while that of the core CPI has  also increased, both pointing to a persistent trend of elevated inflation
Looking ahead, upside pressures for domestic prices could arise from 1  downward price stickiness i.e., easy  to rise but hard to fall in some items of the  services category, including food away from home and residential rent; 2 the easing of  border controls leading to hikes in airfares and travel group fees; 3 greater demand for  domestic travel as concerns over pandemic waves diminished, and the resulting rise in  prices for hotels and accommodation; 4 the planned hike of minimum wages next year

For the first four months of the year, the M2 annual growth rate averaged  5.81,  within  the  2.5-6.5  reference  range  but  slightly  higher  than  5.44  of  the  fourth quarter last year
Looking ahead, the global economic outlook is confronted by many uncertainties,  as  these  factors,  including  monetary  policy  paths  of  major  central  banks  such  as  the  timing  of  a  Fed  or  ECB  pivot  to  easing,  developments  after  the  BoJ  ended  negative  interest rate policy, etc
Compared to the end of last year, the level of concentration of real estate lending increased slightly as of the end of July
As a result, consumer spending slumped, and the recovery of domestically-oriented services sectors faltered
International commodity prices, including crude oil, have mostly declined, alleviating global inflationary pressures
Combined with the growth-dampening effect of a warm winter at the start of the year, food prices are likely to pick up
Borrowers would also be required to commit  to begin construction within a specific time frame, a rule aiming at urging them to begin  building work sooner so as to increase housing supply and prevent undue financing for  land hoarding
In addition, the non-performing loan ratios of these two loan brackets stayed  low, indicating good credit quality
The impact on workers pay could further weigh on private spending
The proposed actions at todays meeting was a  policy  mix  of  two  quantity-related  tools  by  adjusting  the  selective  credit  control  measures alongside an RRR hike
Board  members  reached  a  unanimous  decision  to  raise  the  policy  rates  by  0.125  percentage points
In regard to housing market-related measures, the Banks four recent rounds of selective credit controls were in fact financial stability measures introduced to avoid an inordinate credit flow into the real estate sector, instead of attempts aiming directly at housing prices
With global goods demand cooling off, the European energy crunch thawing on a  warm  winter,  and  China  lifting  pandemic  lockdown  measures,  concerns  about  goods  supply disruptions also eased, global supply chain pressures fell to pre-pandemic levels and container freight rates dropped significantly
Given that Taiwans CPI annual growth rate has come close to or exceeded 2 for four  consecutive years, the inflation expectation problem should be heeded
This director expressed concern that the Board did not take action against the housing price issue in the March meeting, neither did it in todays meeting
Second, the seemingly robust  export expansion this year was partially attributable to some sectors emerging from the previous  years contraction thanks to a lower base effect
As for next year, most of them are expected to grow at a slightly slower or similar pace, except for the U.S. where the economy is projected to strengthen further
The director viewed that the effect of a 25 bps hike  was less about dampening housing prices than about sending a message
