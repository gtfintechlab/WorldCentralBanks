The Bank of Japan BoJ embarked on  policy normalization with a rate hike this week, ending the negative interest rate policy  and  abolishing  yield  curve  control  while  maintaining  a  loose  monetary  policy  stance
The annual growth rate of M2 measured on a daily average  basis decreased from 7.25 in the fourth quarter of 2022 to an average of 6.69  in  the  first  four  months  of  2023
Therefore,  the Bank will continue reviewing the status of banks real estate lending and  the  effectiveness  of  the  selective  credit  controls,  closely  monitor  potential  impacts  of  real  estate  sector-related  policies  on  the  housing  market,  and  adjust relevant measures as needed in order to promote financial stability and  sound banking operations
In respect of money supply, owing to the economic slowdown and weaker annual  growth  in  bank  loans  and  investments  so  far  this  year,  the  annual  growth  rate  of  the  monetary aggregate M2, measured on a daily average basis, decreased to 6.44 during  the Jan.-Oct. period from the 7.54 recorded in the same period last year, still within  the reference range of 2.5-6.5
Another board director pointed out that during the global financial crisis the Bank held six meetings during the four months of September through December instead of just the two scheduled quarterly meetings
Another Board Director pointed out that, although rising stock prices helped to mitigate a tightening in financial conditions, the wealth effect of stock rallies mainly benefited foreign investors, who collectively hold about 40 of the shares listed on Taiwans stock markets
In  respect  of  private  investment,  an  improving  outlook  for  goods  exports  would  likely drive private investment in 2024
The domestic economy is on track to solid growth this year, likely expanding by 4.53  according to the Banks forecast
For this year, the Bank forecast the CPI and core CPI annual growth rates to be 0.91 and 0.78, respectively
Therefore, this director considered it to be the right move to keep related regulations in place
Nevertheless, there remain downside risks such as the  spread of the new virus variants and lingering supply chain bottlenecks
For the year as a whole, international institutions projected oil prices to be higher  than the previous  year
Another Board Director expressed a similar view that, in the context of a gradual recovery next year and insufficient momentum for private consumption and investment, it is even more important to maintain a stable financial environment while the government is pressing ahead with expansionary fiscal stimulation
As of October 2022, annual growth rates of real estate lending, housing loans, and construction loans edged down to 8.6, 7.6, and 12.18, respectively
Meanwhile, as minimum  wage  and  public  sector  pay  were  scheduled  to  be  raised  next  year,  private  consumption is expected to enjoy further growth
Meanwhile,  the  construction  loan  ratio  of  domestic  banks was 27.05, still below the 30 cap prescribed in Article 72-2 of the Banking  Act.2  The ratio of non-performing housing loans extended by domestic banks remained  low at 0.08
The Bank forecasted inflation and core inflation rates for 2022 at 2.93 and 2.59, respectively
A rate cut would indicate the Banks stance on easing and a commitment to ensure ample market liquidity
With government helping banks to help businesses, it showed the importance of the corporate sector
The data also showed that the average LTV ratio of this loan bracket had stayed  high since July 2023
The NT dollar has strengthened against the US dollar, but the real effective exchange rate REER index of the NT dollar trended down as major currencies appreciated more markedly against the US dollar
The director expressed  support for a rate hold today, but noted that by the time the next quarterly Board Meeting  is  convened,  the  Bank  should  pay  special  attention  to  price  uptrends  and  to  whether  consumer  sentiment  about  prices  would  step  up  inflation  expectations  and  create  an  impact on price stability
Policy Propositions To raise the discount rate, the rate on refinancing of secured  loans, and the rate on temporary accommodations by 0.125 percentage points to  1.625, 2, and 3.875, respectively; and to increase the reserve requirement  ratios  on  NT  dollar  demand  deposits  and  time  savings  deposits  by  0.25  percentage points, respectively
Domestic  market  liquidity  was  ample  and  short  and  long -term  market  rates  fluctuated  within  a  small  range  in  recent  months
The proposition to restrict the  LTV ratios of this loan bracket seemed to aim at the concern that excessive lending to  the  real  estate  sector  could  undermine  banks risk control
The  Feds aggressive hikes came with a worrying economic outlook; if the U.S. economy  has  a  hard  landing,  then  Taiwan  could,  in  the  following  six  months,  sustain  injury  in  many  aspects  including  investment,  consumption,  and  exports,  a  consideration  that  warranted the directors support for a 0.125 percentage point rate hike
Another board director pointed to the complex international economic and financial  conditions recently
Overall, the pace of disinflation remained slow
As of the end of April, the average annual growth rate of home loans extended  by  banks  rose  modestly  while  that  of  construction  loans  declined  further,  and  their  non- performing ratios stayed low
The non-performing loan NPL ratio of home-purchase loans of domestic banks stood at 0.15 in July, lower than the NPL ratio of all loans, which was 0.25
From the beginning of 2022, domestic prices of food and oil-related products were pushed up by rising import costs, and domestic harvests of fruit and vegetables were restrained by unfavorable weather conditions, leading the consumer price index CPI annual growth rate to trend upwards
By contrast, serious  debates and rigorous research on inflation are somewhat insufficient in Taiwan
The growth projections made by major forecasting institutions for Taiwan this year ranged between 1.05 and 2.37
In  January  and  February  this  year,  the  inflation  rate  fluctuated  more  markedly  owing to the Lunar New Year holidays
The Banks survey on  investment trust companies revealed a significant increase in the number of respondents expecting  the  CPI  inflation  rate  to  exceed  1  in  the  following  12  months,  indicating  higher  inflation  expectations
According to the Banks forecast, this years economic growth rate will be a moderate 2.58, slightly lower than last years 2.86
Looking ahead, the global economy is still clouded by multiple downside risks, mainly including the Russia-Ukraine conflict, inflation expectations likely being pushed up by high global inflation, a slowdown in Chinas economic growth, and tightening international financial conditions, which could weigh on global production as well as economic and trade activity
Price trends of international commodities and domestic services as well as  weather events are among the possible factors affecting Taiwans inflation this year
In  addition, the estimation of the money demand function showed that the growth rate of demand  for M2 is likely to range between 2.5 and 6.5 next year, consistent with the reference range  used by the Bank
In the four quarter of 2020, the number and  amount of high-value housing increased by 17.57 and 23.92 year on year, respectively
In respect of external demand, a slow global economic recovery caused Taiwans  exports to shrink by 11.5 during the first eleven months of the year; all major product  categories recorded negative growth, except for ICTAV information, communication  and technology, and audio-visual products thanks to demand for AI and other emerging  technology  applications
Since  the beginning of  this year,  the U.S.,  Europe, and  some  Asia-Pacific  economies had aggressively raised their policy rates to tame relatively higher  inflationary pressures
Meanwhile, international institutions expected that global inflation and inflation in most economies would be weaker than last year, citing a sluggish global economic prospect and a projected downtrend in international oil prices
Looking  ahead,  global  economic  prospects  face  many  downside  risks,  including  the cumulative effect of major central banks tightening and the duration for the policy  rates to stay elevated, greater risk for the Chinese economic slowdown to worsen, and  fragmentation in the world economy, all of which could weigh on the momentum of the  global  economic  recovery
In  the  second  half  of  the  year,  despite still sluggish investment activity, economic growth was expected to rebound by  3.84, with exports gaining traction as a result of global supply chain destocking and  domestic demand buttressed by steady private consumption growth and the  governments tax  surplus  rebates
The Bank will also stay attentive to incoming information  regarding  monetary  policy  paths  of  major  central  banks,  risks  from  Chinas  economic  downturn,  international  raw  material  prices,  geopolitical  risks,  extreme  weather,  etc
In terms of the inflation outlook, considering the adverse impact on domestic consumption demand caused by the spread of the virus, combined with plunging international oil and raw material prices, the Bank trims the forecasts of the CPI and core CPI annual growth rates for 2020 to 0.59 and 0.55, respectively Appendix Table 2
In respect of domestic demand, private  consumption recorded solid growth thanks to resurging post -pandemic  demand  for  domestic  travel  and  dining,  but  private  investment  remained  sluggish  as  capital  equipment  imports  still  exhibited  negative  growth
In addition, the Bank estimated that Taiwan would have a negative output gap in  2024
Likewise, downward  price stickiness  of  food away from home  also warrants attention as its annual growth  rate has stayed elevated, and a faster hike in food-away-from-home prices could make  it harder for inflation pressures to ease anytime soon
For  the  outlook  of  this  year,  the  CPI  inflation  rate  would  likely  slow  down  from  last  year  given  a  mild  rise  in  commodity  prices,  as  international  oil  prices were  projected  by international institutions  to  edge up  from  the  previous year, and a smaller increase in services prices owing to a high base  effect
Currently, the only restriction imposed on the newly- extended second housing loans for homes in the specific areas was the prohibition of a grace period during which borrowers pay just the interest but not the principal  and some banks appeared to have applied looser mortgage underwriting standards  compared to other banks
One board director remarked that the persistent easy money conditions in Taiwan is related  to ample market liquidity amid a saving glut and investment deficiency
Short-term market interest rates climbed higher in September 2023, reflecting end- of-quarter funding needs, the Mid-Autumn Festival long-weekend holiday, provisional  payments of profit-seeking enterprise income tax, and continued net selling and outward  remittances by foreign institutional investors
Among major economies, growth in the US economy is expected to accelerate, the euro area continues to exhibit robust growth, while Japan and China are likely to expand at a slower pace
Global recovery is steadily on track, but uncertainties remain
Major institutions at home and abroad projected Taiwans economy  to grow by 0.77-2.00 in 2023 and by 2.30-3.40 in 2024
Overall, the current inflation upswing is viewed to be transitory and inflation is expected to  be mild for this year as a whole, with next years inflation outlook tilting to the downside
Factors likely  to  influence  the  future  path  of  domestic  inflation  include  price  trends  of  international  commodities and domestic services, as well as weather conditions
As a result, 10-year government bond yields of  the US, Japan, and Germany were all on the rise
In terms of participants, one board director pointed to an inspiring sense of unity in Taiwan during the 2008 global financial crisis, when the government helped banks, banks helped businesses, and businesses helped workers  the kind of inspiration that should be re-created by the banking sector in the current crisis to turn the tide
As a result, it is expected that growth momentum for the global economy is likely to soften this year
International  institutions  trimmed  down  the  global  economic growth forecast for this  year and revised up their projections for global  inflation
Market attention to major  central banks monetary policy moves has induced greater volatility in international  financial markets
Private investment also exhibits brighter prospects
The  Bank  will  take  these  into  account  in  assessing  the  implications  for  domestic  economic  and  financial  conditions  and  adjust  its  monetary  policy  in  a  timely  manner  as  warranted,  so  as  to  fulfill  the  statutory duties of maintaining financial and price stability and fostering economic  development within the scope of the above objectives
The Banks 2024 inflation projections were revised upwards on account of the  planned electricity tariff hike in April
In addition to this Facility, as part of the governments continued efforts to urge state-owned banks to give full support for SMEs, other central agencies introduced SME aid programs that could also expect keen cooperation from state-owned banks
For  next  year,  it was expected Taiwans exports would be  buoyed up by stronger world trade growth than this year, booming demand for emerging   technology  applications,  and  consumers sustained  appetite  for  cross-border  travel
Therefore,  the  member  supported  a  rate  hike  by  0.125  percentage  points
Another  board  director  noted  that  current  international  financial  conditions  have  faced  increasingly  higher  uncertainties  than  before;  a  similar  situation  would  lead  to  different assessments in different times, hence the difference in the size of policy rate  adjustments
This was mainly because Taiwan has broadly kept the pandemic situation under  control and has experienced little supply chain bottlenecks such as logistics problems, and  the domestic labor market did not face capacity constraints and recorded mild growth in  average non-farm employee earnings
In the international financial markets, equity price volatility intensified at the beginning of the year but abated after mid-February, while VIX the widely-followed measure of expected volatility also dropped then and moved within a narrower range
Banks  excess  reserves  averaged  slightly  above  NT45  billion  for  the  three  months  from June to August
Amid the evolving pandemic, the Bank paid close attention to credit conditions of small and medium-sized enterprises
On the other hand, imported inflationary pressures would be held down by lower international oil prices projected for this year
Moreover,  the  average  real  annual  growth  rates  of  total  employee  earnings  turned  negative  for  the  January-April  period  of  the  year,  the  first  negative  growth  in  seven  years,  warranting  continued attention to the potential impact of prices on real total earnings growth
In  the  domestic  financial  system,  liquidity  remained  ample,  and  banks  excess  reserves  stayed  above  NT50  billion  recently
In  respect  of  external  demand,  sluggish  global  final  demand,  ongoing  inventory  adjustments, and a higher base effect combined to drag Taiwans exports down by  16.9 year on year for the first five months of 2023
The overnight call loan rate has also been steady
Meanwhile, housing price rises continued but at a slower pace
Should  these  uncertainties  and  risks  materialize  andor intensify, they could weigh down the global economic recovery
Another board director stated that there are three types of interest rate decisions, a rate cut, a rate hold, and a rate hike
For the first two months of the year, the annual CPI growth rate averaged 2.60,  reflecting price rises in fuel and lubricant products, food away from home, fruit, durable  consumer  goods,  and  transportation  with  a  combined  contribution  of  1.57  percentage  points to the increase
For the outlook of next year, as continuous expansion in the global economy and  trade were expected to bolster Taiwans exports and private investment, coupled with  continuous private consumption growth, the Bank forecasted the economy to expand by  3.08  in  2025
Surging  energy  and  food  prices  have  kept  inflation  in  major  economies  at  high  levels  this  year  so  far
The annual CPI growth rate stood at 2.35 in November, while the core CPI annual growth rate, excluding fruit, vegetables, and energy items, remained high at 2.86
One board director stated the current domestic downturn was partly due to a higher  base effect arising from robust economic growth in the past three  years,  while  global  inflation also took its toll on our economy
In particular, it needs to be determined if the significant increase in net ETF assets in the interim affected M2 growth adversely
The  Bank  therefore  slightly  upgraded  the  forecast for Taiwans 2024 GDP growth rate to 3.22 see Appendix Table 1  for the forecasts by major institutions, which was higher than 1.31 in 2023
With the spread of the coronavirus, the global economy is expected to expand at a notably slower pace this year, which may undermine Taiwans exports
Developments since the Board met in June 2023 showed a slow recovery in global  final demand owing to the cumulative effect of aggressive tightening by major central  banks  in  the  US  and  Europe
A reference survey the Bank conducted on investment trust companies revealed  an increased share of those respondents expecting domestic prices to slightly turn upwards, and  the expectation pointed to a mild inflation
Given the decline in international raw material prices and a higher base effect, the  annual CPI growth rate was expected to gradually come down from the third quarter of  the year onwards
The annual growth rate of the CPI was 1.97 in 2021, 2.95 in 2022, and 2.49  in 2023 and is projected by the Bank to be 2.16 in 2024
The Bank forecasted that the annual growth rates of the  CPI  and  the  core  CPI  would  register  2.46  and  2.56  in  2023,  lower  than  2.95 and  2.61  in  2022 see  Appendix  Table 2 for the forecasts by  major  institutions
Related discussions are summarized as follows
The average core CPI annual growth rate excluding fruit, vegetables, and energy prices for the same period was 0.97
Exports are projected to expand at a slower pace next year
The amended Regulations  Governing  the  Extension  of  Mortgage  Loans  by  Financial  Institutions the Regulations took effect on December 8, 2020, a policy move in line with  the aims of efficient allocation and proper use of credit resources in the governments  Program to Foster a Sound Real Estate Market. So far, the LTV ratios of the loans  governed by the Regulations have dropped and the interest rates thereof have risen, but  there remains a substantial increase in banks real estate lending
The median of domestic institutions CPI forecasts is 1.18 and that of international institutions forecasts is 1.30
For the first five months of the year, the average CPI annual growth rate was 0.60, mainly because a slump in vegetable prices mostly offset the increases in fuel and fruit prices
One board director noted that the key considerations for the Banks monetary policy  conduct may also include housing price trends in addition to inflation and economic growth
In addition, second  housing loans taken out by natural persons  increased both in terms of the number of borrowers and as a share of total borrowers of  newly-extended  housing  loans
Key drivers contributing to the  rise included rising food prices such as food away from home and fruit, higher housing  rent, and prices rises for personal effects and entertainment services, with a combined  contribution of 1.51 percentage points, or 67, to the rise in the CPI annual growth rate
Meanwhile, the RJ CRB index,  a global commodities benchmark, was dragged down by the oil price slump
Private  consumption would also continue expanding next year thanks to the planned  minimal  wage  hike  and  public  sector  pay  raise,  albeit  with  slower  year -on- year  growth  than  2023  owing  to  a  higher  base  effect
Financially strapped SMEs could even be forced to close down
While nominal regular earnings of all payroll employees in the  industrial  and  services  sectors  posted  the  highest  annual  growth  rate  since  2000,  real  regular earnings adjusted for inflation actually slipped to negative growth
The biggest contribution came from increased exports of electronic parts and components thanks to solid global demand for semiconductors
At this juncture,  the  Banks  strong commitment to rein in inflation would help lower inflation  expectations
To promote financial stability, reinforce banks credit risk management associated with real  estate lending, and curb inordinate flows of credit resources towards the property market,  the Bank amended the _Regulations Governing the Extension of Mortgage Loans by  Financial Institutions hereinafter the Regulations or Mortgage Loan Regulations  three times from December 2020
In the future, the Bank will monitor the policy changes of other central banks  and the developments in international economic and financial conditions to advise quarterly  reviews and respond as warranted
In terms of bank credit, the annual growth rate of bank loans and investments turned  to a downtrend after December 2022 as exports contracted, mortgage growth declined  year on year, and bank investments shrank further
Nonetheless, major  companies remained cautious in devising investment strategies given the uncertainties  about  the  global  economic  outlook
On another front, Japan has adopted low policy rates for a long time but could still be slipping into the lost 30 years. While monetary policy such as the BoJs balance sheet expansion and fiscal policy such as increased government spending could be used to counter short-term economic cycles, they are not the effective cure for long-term structural diseases, which have been ailing Japan
In this view, private consumption will likely record modest growth this year and grow slightly further next year
Meanwhile,  raising the RRRs by 0.25 percentage points was to require banks to increase the reserves  they already retain and the impact on banking operations should be limited
Domestic long and short-term interest rates went upwards as the Banks hikes in  policy  rates  and  the  reserve  requirement  ratios  RRRs  took  effect  in  June  and  July,  respectively
The Bank forecasted the CPI and  core CPI inflation rates to further decrease from 2.46 and 2.56 in 2023 to 1.89 and  1.83 in 2024, respectively
The board directors decided unanimously to keep the discount rate, the rate on  refinancing  of  secured  loans,  and  the  rate  on  temporary  accommodations  unchanged at 2, 2.375, and 4.25, respectively, to adjust the selective credit  control  measures,  and  to  raise  the  reserve  requirement  ratios  on  NT  dollar  deposits by 0.25 percentage points
Another board director supported the 0.125 percentage point hike and remarked on  the inflation rate
The construction loan  ratio of domestic banks was 26.84 at the end of October 2021, below the 30 cap prescribed  in Article 72-2 of the Banking Act
Since current  economic  readings  were  divergent,  the  director  approved  of  a  rate  hold  for  the  time  being, and noted that continued  monitoring was warranted  for another quarter, with  a  possibility of having to proactively address the issue of inflation
However,  banks  real  estate  lending  continued  to  increase  markedly
Overall, the Bank revised the forecast for this years GDP growth rate slightly upward to 1.60 based on brighter prospects for growth in fixed investment and exports compared to the previous June forecast
In the financial markets, from April 2024 onwards, continuous strength in the US  labor  market and sluggish disinflation bolstered market expectation for a Fed  rate cut  delay,  leading  to  high-level  fluctuations  of  the  US  government  bond  yields
The Bank forecasts this years GDP growth rate to be 2.13, higher than last years 1.48
In the financial markets, US and German government bonds yield curves inverted  owing to recent market expectations about the Fed and the ECB keeping policy rates at  high levels for a considerable time, along with concerns that the cumulative effects of  monetary  tightening  could  suppress  future  economic  growth
Nevertheless,  the  lifting  of  pandemic-related  restrictions  in  most  countries  has  supported a rebound in the services sector
Recent concerns over the turbulence in the banking sectors of the US and Europe  and the ensuing effects on market expectations about the size of rate hikes by major  central  banks  have  heightened  volatility  in  international  financial  markets
However, among construction loans, those taken out for land purchases continued to grow fast,  expanding by 24.1 year on year
Citing the recent uptrend in construction-related financing, one of the board directors  expressed support for the adjustment to reduce the LTV caps to as low as 40, stating that the  timely tightening of selective credit controls would help restrain property speculation
The Bank has made four adjustments to its selective credit control measures since  December 2020
For the first five months of the year, the annual growth rates of the CPI and core CPI excluding fruit, vegetables, and energy items averaged 3.04 and 2.33, respectively
Policy efforts from the Ministry of the Interior, Ministry of Finance, Financial Supervisory Commission, and local governments under the Healthy Housing Market Plan are expected to show results over time
Therefore, the Bank expected to see private investment register  solid  real  growth  this  year
The Bank revises its GDP growth forecast downward to 2.21 in 2023 Appendix  Table 1, a pace slower than the 2.45 in 2022
Looking at different categories of the CPI basket, prices of goods declined recently  while prices of services, which tend to be sticky e.g., easy to increase but slow to  decrease,  continued  to  trend  upwards
The global economic outlook remains shrouded in numerous uncertainties
In addition, housing  market transactions have been dampened somewhat in the year to date as a result of  the governments cross-agency efforts under the Healthy  Real Estate Market Plan and the pandemic flare-up in recent months
Looking ahead, the global economy faces multiple downside risks synchronized monetary policy tightening could deepen the global economic slowdown and undermine financial stability; implications from US-China disputes could hamper the process of globalization; geopolitical risks could disrupt supply chain networks; the Russia-Ukraine war and the ensuing energy crisis in Europe could add to global economic headwinds; and extreme weather events and energy transition efforts could both be inflationary
In China, a surge in COVID-19 cases and inventory destocking sharply impacted corporate sales
The overall monitoring indicator flashed a yellow-blue transitional between stable and sluggish signal
The average annual growth rate of bank loans and investments was 4.45 for the first two months of the year, higher than the sum of the 2018 projected GDP and CPI annual growth rates 3.85, which indicates sufficient supply in the credit market
All board directors expressed support for the policy rate reduction and the introduction of the Special SME Accommodation Facility
Showing the effectiveness of the Banks monetary policy instruments in  guiding market interest rates, most of the money market rates and banks depositlending  rates had sufficiently risen in reflection of the Banks policy rate increases
Another board director agreed with todays propositions and stated that the considerations supporting the policy rate increase by only 12.5 basis pointsincluding financial conditions having tightened, economic activity likely slackening off, relief loan programs closing leaving the respective loan rates at the discretion of banks, and domestic demand recovery sputtering e.g., domestically-oriented services sector posting negative real earnings growthwere understandable
These risks, should they materialize, could hinder global economic growth  and jeopardize financial stability
For  the  first  two  months  of  the  year,  the  average  bank  excess reserves  was  slightly above NT60 billion
One  board  director  remarked  that  the  previous  series  of  selective  credit  controls  were indeed introduced with the aim of a healthy housing market; in the meantime, the  Bank continued monitoring banks loan portfolio to curb an inordinate flow of capital  into the real estate sector
According to international institutions, this years oil  prices would be lower than 2022 but would rebound slightly next year
Against the backdrop of intense inflationary pressures and significant downside risks faced by the global economy, the Bank will closely monitor implications for domestic price trends resulting from the Russia-Ukraine conflict and other geopolitical risks, international commodity price movements, and the global pandemic progress
Another board director pointed out that the recent US rate hike will be followed by further gradual increases, and the euro area and Japan will also raise rates albeit at a slower pace; given the current economic and financial conditions, it will serve Taiwan well to stay put
As manufacturing activity and trade gradually picked up, global economic growth is expected to rebound from the low level of last year
Meanwhile, the non-performing ratios of banks housing loans and construction loans  both remained low, indicating sound credit quality
For  the  first  eleven  months  of  the  year, the annual growth rate of the CPI averaged 2.48 and that of the core  CPI averaged 2.60
International  institutions  forecasted  that,  for  this  year,  oil  prices  would  trend  slightly lower than last year and drop further next year
Moreover, as the  domestic market already had ample liquidity, raising the policy rates could attract capital  inflows and further buoy up liquidity
In addition, despite some signs of cooling in housing transactions  and slower price rises, the uptrend in housing prices still continued; given that residential  rent serves as a lagging indicator of housing prices and has a significant weighting in  the CPI basket, rises in rent could in turn drive up overall prices
In all, these  factors would mean there is little room for a rate hike
With this potential positive effect on private consumption, next years GDP growth projection is likely to be revised up
Regarding  money  supply,  the  daily  average  annual  growth  rate  of  the  monetary  aggregate  M2 dropped from 7.48 in 2022 to 6.25 in 2023, returning  to  the 2.5- 6.5  reference  range
Although the headline and  core  inflation  rates  were  edging  downwards,  their  average  values  for  the  first  five  months  of  2023  were  still  higher  than  those  of  the  previous  ten  years
One supervisor stated that according to the DGBAS, who is responsible for CPI  statistics compilation in Taiwan, residential rent has a weight of about 15, while the  U.S. assigns a higher weight to rent above 30 and the sample of housing units are  for urban U.S. Across many countries, data show that housing prices have posted larger  increases than rents
Two board directors gave opinion on the fact that M2 growth had exceeded the upper end  of the reference range
A 70 LTV ratio cap was thus to be introduced for the  second housing loans taken out by natural persons for homes in the specific areas  so as to strengthen real estate-related credit risk management
All primary export categories posted negative growth,  except  for  ICTAV  information,  communication  and  technology,  and  audio-visual  products  as  they  were  buttressed  by  demand  for  AI  and  other  emerging  technology  applications
The Bank has made five amendments to its selective credit control measures since  December 2020, which have helped banks mitigate risks associated with real estate  lending
One board director noted that, in addition to closely following the changes in the Feds  policy, the Bank should also monitor the effect of domestic consumers inflation expectations  and the future price trends and put them into proper consideration in the next quarterly meeting  and adjust the monetary policy timely as warranted
On  balance,  the  Bank  expected  real  private  investment to resume modest positive growth in 2024
The  Bank expected Taiwans economic growth to accelerate in the second half of the  year  compared  to  the  previous  half
Household inflation expectations might capture the tipping point of structural changes in inflation
The  Board  thus  decided  to  raise  the  reserve  requirement  ratios  on  NT  dollar  passbook  and  time  savings  deposits  by  0.25  percentage points, effective July 1, 2024 Appendix 2
These could drive up domestic prices for energy,  food,  and  durable  consumer  goods,  thereby  stoking  inflationary  pressures
Domestic short-term interest rates were broadly stable
Domestic growth momentum could weaken slightly; actual output is below potential  Exports might grow a little more slowly because of a higher base effect, whereas domestic demand will be the key driving force of economic growth given a rebound in private investment and steady private consumption growth
In  the  labor  market,  the  number  of  employed persons continued increasing in recent months, the unemployment  rate registered lower than that  in the same period last year, and total nominal  earnings posted mild growth
With  regard  to  money  supply,  the  annual  growth  rate  of  M2  fell  from  6.80  in  February to 6.58 in March; the rate edged up to 6.70 in April as demand deposits  increased as a result of the governments universal surplus tax rebates
Since the start of the year, international oil prices recovered ground from previous lows
Taking this  assessment into account, the  Board judged that  maintaining the current  policy  rate levels  and monetary easing would help sustain price and financial  stability and foster economic  growth
Meanwhile, tight labor markets in the US  and  Europe  and  fragmentation  of  the  global  economy  could  make  it  difficult  to  ease  inflationary  pressures
One  board  director  pointed  out  that  the  Bank,  in  view  of  weak  momentum  for  domestic  economic  growth,  downgraded its forecast for Taiwans 2023 GDP growth  rate to below 2 with a possibility of turning lower
Even though monetary policy space could be smaller after this rate cut, Taiwan will not pursue negative interest rates
Core inflation excluding vegetables, fruit, and energy items recorded an average annual growth rate of 0.97, indicating mild price rises
Domestic  market  liquidity  was  ample  and  short  and  long -term  market  rates  fluctuated  within a narrow range in  recent  months
However, the US Fed is about to initiate the balance sheet normalization program, while the ECB may also review its asset purchase scheme
Once that expectation takes hold, it would be difficult to reverse the trend even with loan-to-value restrictions or tax-based policies
For the outlook of 2024 as a whole, domestic commodity prices would likely rise  mildly given that international oil prices were forecasted by foreign institutions to run  higher  than  2023

Therefore, private investment is likely to register mild growth
This board director highlighted that, in accordance with the Central Bank of the R.O.C
The Bank revised down this years economic growth rate projection to 3.75
In  this  view,  the  Bank   needs  to  closely  monitor  the  developments  of  these  events  and  the  stances  of  major  central banks so as to adopt appropriate policy responses as needed
In  addition,  this  Board  decided  to  hold  rates  unchanged  in  September  even  as  the  economic  and  financial  conditions  were  more  stringent than the current environment
However, the core inflation rates did  not  drop  as  fast,  reflecting  slower  services  price  decreases  owing  to  downward  price  stickiness
In  the  months  since  midyear,  the  decline  in  Taiwans  export  growth  has  slowed as continued sluggishness in global final demand was somewhat offset  by  stronger  export  momentum  of  information  communication  technol ogy  products to meet demand for emerging technology applications and by  narrower  contractions  in  traditional  sector  exports
Global inflation is expected to rise steadily amid continued global economic growth and rising raw material prices
Moreover,  positive  readings from data on exports, investment, and consumption indicated that a rate hike  would  not  create  much  of  a  concern
There remain many uncertainties over international economic, trade, and financial prospects, including the lack of clarity in future developments of US trade policy towards China, Europe, and Japan, Chinas economic downturn, and possible extension of Brexit deadline

A number of board directors believed that the Bank should continue to monitor changes in housing prices, and gave their views on the indicators helpful in making the decision to adopt selective credit controls
Taiwans  high-tech  manufacturers  increased  capital  expenditure,  leading  to  an  expansion  in  capital  equipment  imports
Another board director also stated that the April electricity tariff hike had a limited  effect  on  the  domestic  inflation  rate
Meanwhile, domestic demand was tepid as retail sales continued to contract in recent months, and private investment was somewhat reserved as reflected in declining capital equipment imports
Domestic inflation has been stabilizing and the output gap is expected to be modestly negative next year
This suggests that domestic financial conditions have been adequately accommodative and there is ample market liquidity to support expansions in corporate and household spending
In this view, the Bank revised its inflation forecasts to 2.09 for  both the inflation and core inflation rates for this year, which were lower than the levels  of 2022 at 2.95 and 2.61, respectively
Price  trends  in  the  year  so  far  pointed  to  a  downward  trend  in  the  core  inflation  rates in major economies, indicating continuous easing in global inflationary pressures
International oil prices touched a three-year high in late January and later fluctuated at a lower, narrow range in line with the changes in US crude oil inventories
The annual growth rate of the consumer price index CPI rose from 1.94 in April  2024  to  2.24  in  May,  mainly  owing  to  faster  growth  in  the  prices  of  fruit  and  vegetables

For the first two  months  of  the  year,  banks  excess  reserves  averaged  around  NT54.9  billion;  the  annual  growth  rate  of  M2  measured  on  a  d aily  average  basis  and  that  of  bank loans and investments averaged 5.51 and 7.19 respectively
In light of elevated domestic inflation, a larger policy rate increase would more significantly exacerbate interest burdens of economically-vulnerable businesses and workers taking out relief loans and other policy loans; it would be more appropriate to adopt a more moderate pace for todays rate hike
The Peoples Bank of China, on the other hand, deployed more easing measures
The coronavirus outbreak is causing serious supply and demand shocks to the global economy
Consequently, oil prices moved downwards
However,  exports  still  saw  tepid  recovery  momentum  as  final  demand  remained  suppressed  by  a  dim  global  economic  outlook,  while  domestic  consumer spending was not sufficiently strong
Therefore,  it  would  not  be  appropriate  to  raise  the  policy  rates  in  todays meeting
In  addition,  the  Bank  estimated  that  Taiwan  would  have  a  slightly  negative output gap in both 2024 and 2025
For  the  outlook  of  next  year,  a  rebound  in  global  goods  trade  growth  as  projected by international institutions and the continuous boom in emerging  tech applications would likely bolster growth in Taiwans exports and private  investment
However, May data showed a 7.7 decline year-on-year
Manufacturing  and  non-manufacturing  sentiment  for  the  outlook  for  the  next  six  months,  albeit  climbing  back up, still exhibited caution
For the year as  a  whole,  export  growth  would  continue  to  receive  a  boost  from  the  steadily  rising  demand  for  emerging  tech  applications,  as  well  as  benefiting  from  an  increase  in  inbound  travel
Recent data on multiple inflation-related indicators all pointed to a prospective ease  in domestic inflationary pressures
While Taiwans inflation was mild relative to other major economies, it was  partly  sustained  by  tariff  and  tax  control  measures  aiming  at  restraining  raw  material  prices
However, the long-term effects of protracted low interest rates on Taiwans economy as a whole have been unclear and should be revealed in a timely manner
US and German 10-year government bond yields increased due to market expectations that the Fed would tighten monetary policy faster, begin shrinking its balance sheet, and that the ECB would end asset purchases and gradually start raising rates
Meanwhile, with the WTO Goods Trade Barometer recently climbing to a new high, the growth rate of world trade volume was also forecasted to rebound markedly this year and edge down somewhat next year
Therefore, to contain housing speculation and  property hoarding, and to prioritize the channeling of credit resources towards non- homeowners  seeking  owner-occupied  housing,  the  Board  would  consider  the  following amendments to the selective credit controls    a Imposing a new rule that no grace periods should be granted to a natural person  applying for a first outstanding home loan  when the  person already owns  buildings to hisher name
Taking into account the upside and downside factors, the director approved of a rate hold  and noted that, given the transmission lags of monetary policy, it was with hope that more  effects would show progressively
One way to increase banks willingness to lend to the distressed SMEs would be to raise the guarantee ratio of the Small and Medium Enterprise Credit Guarantee Fund of Taiwan SMEG, thereby mitigating lending risks and bringing down funding costs; it also seemed appropriate to allow banks to decide the levels of interest rates on such loans
Nevertheless, the impact from rising COVID-19 infections at home  since mid-May led to an increase in furloughs
Price changes in the CPI components  showed upward and downward swings in vegetables and services prices, but overall the  CPI  annual  growth  rate  gradually  came  down

Forecasts by  major domestic and foreign institutions for  Taiwans inflation rate ranged between 2.24  and  2.51  for  this  year  and  between  1.64 and 2.70 for the year 2024
Meanwhile, demand for funds driven by the economic recovery is expected to support continued growth in bank loans and investments
Another  board  director,  in  favor  of  a  rate  hold,  stated  that  a  pause  would  be  appropriate so that the Bank may review the effects of its monetary policy and take this  into consideration for the next policy meeting
Overall,  financial  conditions were accommodative
Despite recent consecutive negative CPI annual growth rates, a lot more items in the CPI basket of goods and services exhibited price rises than those items with price declines, indicating that there was barely a broad-based price downtrend, nor pronounced signs of deflation

In  addition,  several  neighboring  economies  had  turned  less  hawkish  with  rate holds or even rate cuts
In the housing market, recent data showed housing trading cooled down, while real  estate  lending  continued  to  post  slower  year-on-year  growth,  albeit  with  a  still  high  outstanding balance
Still, the member agreed with todays 0.125  percentage point rate hike proposition
Nevertheless, considering that investment plans could be interrupted by this pandemic, as well as a higher base effect, the Bank forecasted a moderation in real private investment growth
The Bank of Japan BoJ also made no change in its easy policy stance
This is also the case for Taiwan
Compared to the previous forecast made in December 2023, there was a slight upward  revision  by  0.10  percentage  points,  reflecting  increased  contribution  from  net  foreign  demand and private consumption
The Bank expected that the inflation rate in the second half of the y ear would  be  slightly  lower  than  the  first  half
Domestic price trends for next year could face upside pressures from increased overseas and domestic travel due to border reopening, the scheduled hike in minimum wages, and possible electricity and gas rate hikes
Since the Board met in late June this year, advanced economies and emerging market economies have both been recovering at a steady pace
Meanwhile, SME  loans granted by banks under the Facility during the aforementioned period 20200401   20210704 will remain eligible for the Facilitys preferential interest rates until June 30,  2022
One other board director stated that as major economies implemented rate reductions Taiwan should not lag behind too much, citing also the remaining room for lower rates as well as the announcement effect of the Banks policy stance
In 2017 so far, as the NT dollar appreciation helped mitigate imported inflationary pressures and food prices stayed low, consumer prices have risen mildly
However, as lives began to return to normal after the pandemic waned, entertainment  prices experienced sharper-than-expected price surges; in addition, worldwide avian flu  pushed up prices of eggs and chicken meat and the domestic electricity tariffs were also  raised significantly
In terms of economic growth,  despite the aforementioned forecast downgrade for this  year, growth was projected to  accelerate next year
However, the semiconductor industry is known to be cyclical, and the industrys bust cycle would bode ill for private investment growth
The Board decided unanimously at the meeting today to raise the discount rate, the rate on refinancing of secured loans, and the rate on temporary accommodations to 1.5, 1.875, and 3.75, respectively, effective June 17, 2022
For the year of 2022, given a stable outlook for global oil prices forecasted by international  institutions,  the  Bank  projects  that  the  annual  growth  rates  of  the  CPI  and  the  core  CPI  would  both  drop  to  0.92
One board director noted the current economic situation was a moderate domestic  economy  confronted  by  an  external  cool-down
In terms of monetary policy developments overseas, central banks in advanced economies had kept policy rates unchanged in the year so far, albeit showing a more dovish turn in general
Therefore, to further enhance management of bank credit resources and reduce related  credit risk, the Bank decided to amend the Regulations Governing the Extension of  Mortgage Loans by Financial Institutions to lower the aforementioned LTV ratio cap  on natural persons second outstanding home loans for housing in the specific areas to  60, effective June 14, 2024 Appendix 1
According to the Banks estimation, the inflation  rate  this  year  would  peak  in  the  second  quarter owing to a one-off spike from the lower base a year ago
Both were considered conducive to private consumption, though wage growth was moderate
Nevertheless, the Forward-Looking Infrastructure Development Program rolled out by the government may shore up private investment, while mild wage increases are likely to boost private consumption, which will combine to bolster domestic demand as a major driving force for economic growth
On the other hand, the last time the Bank adjusted reserve requirements was more than a decade ago, and the effect of this type of adjustment at a time when bank excess reserves stayed somewhat elevated would be limited
The board directors decided to raise the discount rate, the rate on refinancing of secured loans, and the rate on temporary accommodations by 0.125 percentage points to 1.75, 2.125, and 4, respectively
We will also conduct a rolling review  on  the  results  of  these  regulations  and  measures  and  make  timely  adjustments  as  warranted to ensure sound banking operations and promote financial stability
One board director stated that, after the adjustments are approved, the Bank will meet with  banks with the aim of further improving the relevant rules
In  the  financial markets,  softening  US  inflation  and signs of  the  economy  weakening boosted market expectations of an earlier rate cut by the Fed next year, thus  sending the 10-year US Treasury yields sharply down and causing a broad rally across  major  stock  markets  around  the  world
Another board director noted that the consolidated land and housing income tax 2.0 entered into force not long ago, but recent data still showed excessively high annual growth rates of building ownership transfers and land sales
The average LTV ratio for natural persons second housing loans for homes in the  specific areas was high and on the rise The Banks statistical data showed that  the average LTV ratio of this loan bracket was 75.5 in October 2021 but rose to  77.1 in April, showing a trend towards looser loan underwriting by banks
On  the  other  hand,  the  price  trends  in  the  intermeeting period were similar to those considered for the previous Board Meeting,  and it was forecasted that the inflation and core inflation rates would be lower this year  than last year and would likely ease to below 2 next year
One board director noted that the services sector was battered by the pandemic and was having a hard time regaining its footing
The global economic outlook remains clouded by pandemic uncertainties, including recurring  virus  outbreaks,  discovery  of  new  virus  variants,  and  uneven  vaccination  progress  across  regions
If these risks materialize or intensify, they could dampen the global economic recovery and hamper financial stability
The average annual growth rate of bank loans and investments  also increased from 6.26 in  the fourth quarter last  year  to 7.32 in  the first four  months this year
These  developments  indicated  solid  domestic  economic growth
With vegetable prices falling on the back of stable weather conditions, communications rates decreasing, and consumer electronics products offered at promotional prices, the annual growth rates of CPI and core CPI stayed low for the first two months of the year
All board directors favored the decision to keep the policy interest rates unchanged, based  mainly on the uncertainty surrounding economic growth amid the recent domestic virus flareup
Moreover, for the year to date, export growth would have turned negative when excluding electronic partscomponents or those shipped to China
In addition, the Bank estimated that Taiwan would have a slightly negative output  gap in 2024
For the first two months of 2022, the consumer price index CPI posted an average  annual growth rate of 2.60, a still fast pace mainly because of domestic fuel price  hikes  following  international  oil  rallies  and  cost-pushed  price  increases  for  food  away  from  home,  as  well  as  rising  prices  for  fruit,  durable  consumer  goods,  and flight  tickets
In  addition, next years hikes in base wage and public sector pay are likely to inspire a private  sector wage increase
This called for the  Banks close attention and, if necessary, might require a new round of selective credit  controls on the real estate market
The  Bank projected Taiwans economy to expand by 4.05 this year, while the growth  projections by major institutions ranged between 3.11 and 4.42
However,  with  major  central  banks  such  as  the  US  Federal  Reserve  Fed  and  the  European  Central  Bank  ECB  maintaining  high  policy  rates,  the  global  economy  continued to experience tepid growth momentum
Recently, the US Federal Reserve Fed continued with rate holds  while the European Central Bank just delivered a rate cut
The average projections for Taiwans inflation rate in 2021 and 2022 by major forecasting  institutions had slowly trended upwards since the beginning of 2021 but remained below 2,  indicating mild pressures of inflation
In the meantime, trade tension among major economies had weighed on global trade growth momentum
2 Financial conditions    From June 2023 onwards, interbank funds transfers increased against a backdrop  of  banks  turning  in  the  collected  income  taxes  to  the  National  Treasury,  large  firms  giving out cash dividends, and foreign institutional investors making outward  remittances of the proceeds from net-selling local stocks
Nevertheless,  given  the  monetary  tightening  actions  by  most  major central banks and a recent  decline in energy prices, the world would likely see  next years inflation come down from previous highs
In  regard  to  global  commodities,  oil  prices  turned  lower  from  October  onwards  owing to a softer-than-expected impact of the Israel-Hamas conflict on crude oil supply,  a still tepid Chinese economy, and increased US crude oil inventories
Monetary Policy Decision The board directors reached a unanimous vote to raise  the discount rate, the rate on refinancing of secured loans, and the rate on temporary  accommodations by 25 basis points to 1.375, 1.75, and 3.625, respectively
Thereafter,  despite continued weakness in exports and private investment in recent months, an  expansion  in  private  consumption  was  expected  to  bolster  economic  growth  for  the  second  quarter
It is thus important to explore potential structural impacts of sustained monetary accommodation on the economy as a whole and whether the Bank has enough wiggle room if a sharper financial recession strikes
Prices of new housing units were trending up, reflecting the rise in national Urban Land  Price Index compiled by the Ministry of the Interior in March 2022
Bank  loans  and  investments  further  decreased  from 6.66 of the fourth quarter of 2022 to 5.55 in the first four months of 2023
Therefore, the pressing issue of inflation should be given  priority
Grains prices had stayed low with modest volatility since October and the  ReutersJefferies  CRB  RJCRB  Index,  a  global  commodities  benchmark,  moved  downwards alongside crude oil price declines
Board members reached a unanimous vote to keep the discount rate, the rate on accommodations with collateral, and the rate on accommodations without collateral unchanged at 1.375, 1.75, and 3.625, respectively
While the government has begun to introduce relief measures and stimulus programs, the Bank has also undertaken supportive actions with an easy monetary environment and a special SME accommodation facility
In addition, geopolitical risks and climate change also  add to uncertainties facing global inflation trends
While it has been a while since the tool was last deployed, the increase in the reserve requirement ratios in todays meeting would affect money supply through the money multiplier effect, the positive and negative outcomes of which should be rigorously followed to help guide future policy formulation
For  the first five months of 2023, the annual growth rate of the CPI averaged 2.44  and that of the core CPI averaged 2.68
Consumer confidence has been robust, and the domestic economy has continued to grow
Thereafter, as the domestic coronavirus outbreak remained contained, the indices for future outlooks for the following six months under Taiwans Manufacturing PMI Purchasing Managers Index and NMI Non-Manufacturing Index both continued to rise, pointing to stable outlooks as anticipated by businesses and a likely upturn in domestic economic growth in the latter half of the year
These developments carried positive implications  for financial stability and indicated that the Banks rate hikes were beginning to show  results
One board director commented in regard to the virus impact on prices, stating that despite downside pressures from international oil slumps and soft domestic consumer spending, this pandemic could cause upside pressures
The Special Accommodation Facilitys interest rate on re-accommodations to banks  Maintained at the current level of 0.1 until June 30, 2022 to ensure funding ease  for SMEs after the policy rate hike  Under the Banks Special Accommodation Facility to Support Bank Credit to Small  and Medium-Sized Enterprises SMEs launched in April 2020, financial institutions  have approved preferential loans to more than 300 thousand borrowers with the total  amount exceeding NT500 billion
In terms of international financial market trends since August 2022, as the Federal  Reserve Fed and the European Central Bank ECB signaled for further tightening, the  U.S. and German10-year government bond yields both rebounded
The member thus supported the 0.125 percentage point rate hike as  a preemptive move
Upward pressures on prices may come from 1 price increases for services such as buses and restaurants owing to higher labor costs under the five-day workweek system, 2 higher cigarette prices as a result of the June 12 hike of the cigarette tax by NT20 per pack, and 3 an expected upsurge in vegetable prices owing to torrential rain in June
Regarding  monetary policy  in the  year so far,  most economies, including the  US  and  Europe,  continued  to  raise  policy  rates  whereas  some  central  banks  began  to  slow or pause the pace of rate hikes based on considerations of economic prospects and  in order to assess the effects of previous rate increases
prices  and subdued fuel and lubricant fees, reaching 2.02 in May
Take for instance electronic parts and components firms, which could easily fall victim to a supply dislocation
One board director approved of the Banks recent moral suasion  on  banks  to  enhance internal management of the total volume of real estate lending and stated that  todays policy moves  adjusting selective credit controls and raising the RRRs  would  help  curb  excessive  credit  flows  to  the  real  estate  market
Global  trade  was  also  forecasted  by  international  institutions  to  grow  slower  in  2022 than in 2021 as the WTO Goods Trade Barometer slid deeper this year so far
The director highlighted that the annual growth rate of the monetary aggregate M2 continued to exceed 6.5, the upper threshold of the Banks M2 growth reference range, and noted the widening interest rate differential between Taiwan and the US
Meanwhile,  a  historically  low  rate  level,  upside  inflationary  pressures from rising raw material prices and transportation costs, and ample market liquidity all  made a rate cut an ill-timed adjustment
For  the  second  half  of  the  year,  despite  sluggish investment growth, exports would likely regain momentum from reduced  inventory levels in global supply chains, while domestic demand continues to firm  up  thanks  to  solid  private  consumption  growth  and  the  governments  newly- launched  initiative  to  promote  post-pandemic  economic  resilience  and  to  share  growth  results  nationwide  with  a  universal  surplus  tax  rebate  program;  it  is  therefore expected that economic growth would rebound in the latter half of 2023
With regard to real estate lending by banks, the annual growth rate had  slowed since the Bank implemented selected credit control measures in December 2020
On  the  other  hand,  the  Bank  made  another  downgrade  to  its  2023  GDP  growth  rate  forecast and estimated that the output gap would remain negative this year
In the face of drastic price volatility caused by supply-side factors, monetary policy responses such as aggressive tightening could concomitantly restrain economic output; therefore, supply-side measures would serve better under the circumstances
Hopes of smaller Fed rate increases and concerns about a looming European recession caused US and German 10-year government bond yields to fall, while global stock markets rallied
Meanwhile, banks excess reserves stayed at levels between NT40 billion and NT60 billion
Nonetheless,  when  seasonal  or  irregular  factors  such  as  massive  inflows  or  outflows of short-term capital lead to excess volatility and disorderly movements  in the NT dollar exchange rate with adverse implications for economic and financial  stability, the Bank, in line with its statutory mandates, will step in to maintain an  orderly market
Overall, in view of bleak prospects for exports and private investment,  the Bank  downgraded the 2023 GDP growth rate forecast to 2.21, lower than the 2022 growth  rate of 2.45
The Bank tackled housing price elevation by increasing the cost and limiting the source of funds for property buyers via LTV ratio caps
Another board director agreed with the rate cut decision, citing a forecast downgrade for domestic economic growth and an uncertain outlook
Moreover, the projections made by international  institutions for Taiwans five-year inflation expectations were also mild, ranging between 1.4  and 1.6
In  this  view,  the  Board  judged  that  a  rate  hike  would  help  contain  domestic  inflation expectations and achieve the policy objectives of price stability and sound  financial and economic development
However, given this was a small increase by 12.5 basis points, it would be important to heed potential impacts of a wider US-Taiwan interest rate differential on capital flows and NT dollar exchange rates
Discussions on housing prices, residential rent, and consumer price measurement  One board director noted that although tax policies may be the most effective tool  to tamp down housing prices, as repeatedly stressed by the Bank and supported by some  researches, this does not keep monetary authorities on the sidelines when housing prices  continue to surge
Reflecting the Banks monetary tightening, interest rates on  bank  deposits  and  loans  rose  higher  and  money  market  rates  all  trended  up
While short-term market interest rates fluctuated slightly, Taiwans government bond  yields tracked the uptrend of US Treasury yields and edged up
Import prices and prices of domestic sales excluding imports  posted  a  year-on-year  increase  of  1.08  and  0.82,  respectively,  for  the  first  eight  months of the year, indicating an absence of imported inflation pressures
Related discussions are  summarized as follows
Meanwhile, real estate loans continued to take up a rising share in  total loans
Combined with a lower base effect, the annual export growth rate was 12.5 for the first five months of the year, with positive growth registered in exports to all major destination economies
Non-performing housing loans remained low at 0.08
Policy Proposition To keep the discount rate, the rate on refinancing of secured loans,  and the rate on temporary accommodations unchanged at 1.125, 1.5, and 3.375,  respectively; to adjust the Banks selective credit control measures
Another Board Director mentioned that while anticipating Taiwans economy to grow faster next year than this year amid a bright global outlook and a gradual domestic recovery, the Bank also projects the negative output gap to widen; this calls for further in-depth study
Deliberations on the content of the selective credit control measures  One board director stated that in an market economy, property investment should be done  with own funds instead of tapping bank loans; in that sense, the LTV cap on new housing loans  for borrowers with at least two outstanding loans should be even lower than proposed
For the Bank to safeguard financial stability, it needs to take policy  actions in response to housing price changes
Major institutions project Taiwans economy to expand between 2.63 and 3.45 in 2022 and between 1.58 and 2.91 in 2023
In sum, uncertainties over the global economic outlook still weigh on external demand; domestic demand is mild, and economic growth, though projected to pick up at a moderate pace in the second half of this year and next year, would still run below potential
In regard to wage growth in the year to date, nominal  growth of total earnings of manufacturing workers slowed year on year owing to export  contraction,  whereas  that  of  services  workers  increased  as  in-person  consumption  rebounded after the pandemic receded
One board director noted the high uncertainty over the COVID-19 pandemic and the  conspicuous gap across industries; for instance, the electronics industry was largely unscathed  and some even benefited from the pandemic, whereas such sectors as food and beverages and  travel and tourism took a heavy blow
By  frequency  of  purchase,  prices  of  staples  more  frequently  purchased  rose  at  a  slightly slower pace in November
One board director pointed to the current environment where Taiwans SMEs were having difficulties because of the virus outbreak
For the first eight months of the year, the annual CPI growth rate for  rent came higher than last year, while that for entertainment services was elevated; given  that housing rent and prices of services tend to exhibit downward price stickiness, the  future path of these categories warrant continuous monitoring
One board director, referring to Taiwans warm inside, cold outside economy,  pointed  out  that  while  external  demand  was  dampened  by  tighter  monetary  and  economic  conditions  abroad,  domestic  private  investment  could  also  be  dented  as  exports and the manufacturing production index continued declining
Although the  selective credit controls had achieved some results, they would still need to be accompanied by  other types of policy efforts if the housing price problem is to be successfully tackled
The future path of domestic inflation would be affected by weather events  and price trends of international commodities as well as domestic services
The core CPI excluding fruit, vegetables, and energy recorded an average annual growth rate of 0.24
Taking into account a lower comparison base this year, the Bank forecasted  that next years real growth in private investment would excess this years
The  Board  decided  to  raise  the  discount  rate,  the  rate  on  refinancing  of  secured loans, and the rate on temporary accommodations by 0.125  percentage  points to  2, 2.375,  and 4.25, respectively, effective  March  22, 2024
Given the downward  price stickiness of rent, if housing prices continue climbing and push up rent along the  way, it would pose  an  even greater  challenge for price stability
Banks excess reserves averaged slightly above NT45 billion for the two months of  March and April
However, synchronized policy rate hikes by major central banks, including the Fed and the ECB, could further slow global growth, undermine financial stability, and heighten economic risks
As a result of mild domestic inflation, Taiwans real interest rate has returned to positive territory whereas those of many major economies remain negative
The  annual  growth  rate  of  the  CPI  came  back  down  in  November,  mainly  owing  to  slower increases in prices of vegetables, fuel and lubricants, and entertainment services
Nevertheless, uncertainties  still exist for this outlook
The CBC has adopted consistent exchange rate policy aimed at dynamic stability
Myriad  uncertainties  facing  the  global  economic  outlook  could  dampen the domestic growth momentum
Despite these supportive forces, capital equipment imports dropped sharply in recent months as investment in semiconductor machinery and equipment was compared against a higher base
One board director contended that, aside from inflation and the unemployment rate, exchange rate movements also play a key role in monetary policy-making
Board members reached a unanimous vote to keep the policy rates unchanged
Combined  with  the governments forthcoming rollout of consumption stimulus measures, it is expected that  private  consumption  would  show  an  upturn
