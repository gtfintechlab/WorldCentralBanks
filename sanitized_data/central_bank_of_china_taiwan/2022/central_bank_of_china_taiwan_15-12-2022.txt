Since the Board last met in September 2022, the effects from the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, elevated inflation, and monetary policy tightening by major economies have markedly dampened global goods consumption demand, causing firms to receive fewer orders and inventories to pile up, putting a drag on global economic growth. With tepid demand for goods, world trade expansion weakened, while supply chain snags continued to ease and shipping rates dropped considerably. As major economies such as the US and Europe still recorded high inflation and many central banks significantly tightened monetary policy, global economic growth is expected to slow further in 2023, with the US and Europe likely entering mild recessions. From October onwards, oil prices dropped to levels last seen prior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine as international institutions downgraded their projections for global crude oil demand growth and US crude oil production increased. For 2023, oil prices are forecasted to be lower than in 2022. Grain prices fell since November after Russia rejoined the Black Sea grain export deal. The global commodities benchmark, the RJ/CRB Index, moved downward before stabilizing at low levels. In spite of oil and grain price declines in recent months, inflation remained high in major economies for the year. Global inflation is expected to soften next year thanks to reduced consumption demand, eased supply bottlenecks, and a higher base effect. Most economies, including the US and Europe, continued to raise policy rates to rein in high inflation, whereas Japan and China maintained an accommodative monetary policy stance. In foreign exchange markets, the US Dollar Index traded significantly lower since November as US inflation posted lower-than-expected numbers for two consecutive months and the Federal Reserve was thought to slow the pace of rate hikes. Major currencies broadly strengthened against the US dollar. Hopes of smaller Fed rate increases and concerns about a looming European recession caused US and German 10-year government bond yields to fall, while global stock markets rallied. Looking ahead, the global economy faces multiple downside risks: synchronized monetary policy tightening could deepen the global economic slowdown and undermine financial stability; implications from US-China disputes could hamper the process of globalization; geopolitical risks could disrupt supply chain networks; the Russia-Ukraine war and the ensuing energy crisis in Europe could add to global economic headwinds; and extreme weather events and energy transition efforts could both be inflationary. The leading and coincident indicators extended their downtrends recently. Manufacturing and non-manufacturing sentiment for the outlook for the next six months remained cautious. Since August 2022, exports were impacted by cooling global final demand and inventory adjustments by foreign firms, resulting in a year-on-year contraction of 13.1% in November, marking the third consecutive month of negative growth. For next year, global economic and trade activity is expected to remain sluggish, keeping final demand weak and inventory adjustments ongoing, dampening Taiwan’s export growth. Exports are projected to expand at a slower pace next year. Private investment growth benefited from investment in advanced equipment by major semiconductor and related supply chain firms. However, with goods exports expected to slow down, business sentiment cautious, and lasting inventory overhang concerns possibly causing firms to delay investments or reduce capital outlays, private investment growth is expected to moderate significantly next year. Private consumption is likely to gain traction as pandemic-related restrictions ease and borders reopen, encouraging in-store and overseas spending. A minimum wage rise and a hike in the income tax-free allowance to be enacted next year would further boost consumption. Private consumption is expected to grow faster next year than this year. In the labor market, the unemployment rate dropped as the pandemic's impact waned, and the number of employed persons slightly increased. However, overtime hours worked in the manufacturing sector posted year-on-year decreases for four consecutive months. With a significant export slowdown this year, the economy is expected to moderate markedly in the fourth quarter, and the GDP growth rate forecast for 2022 has been downgraded to 2.91%. For 2023, the GDP growth rate is expected to slow to 2.53% as a global economic downturn restrains Taiwan’s export and investment growth. Major institutions project Taiwan’s economy to expand between 2.63% and 3.45% in 2022 and between 1.58% and 2.91% in 2023. After policy rates were raised in September and the RRR increase took effect in October, bank deposit and loan rates trended up, and money market interest rates also climbed. Banks’ excess reserves averaged around NT$60 billion in recent months. Short-term market interest rates and bank deposit rates rose in October, reflecting the policy rate hike of 0.125 percentage points. Commercial paper interest rates rose more steeply than the policy rate hike, showing a strong transmission effect from monetary policy. The annual growth rate of bank loans and investments rose steadily since August due to strong private sector demand for working capital and increased government enterprise expenditures. The growth rate stood at 6.75% at the end of October and averaged 7.55% for the first ten months of the year. The RRR increase beginning in July led banks to set aside more reserves, reducing their disposable funds. A net foreign capital outflow further slowed M2 growth, which increased year-on-year by 6.83% in September. Despite another RRR increase, M2 annual growth rose to 7.32% in October due to foreign investor portfolio inflows and faster growth in bank loans and investments. M2 growth averaged 7.54% in the first ten months, exceeding the Bank’s reference range of 6.5%. This was driven by fast bank loans and investments growth but was partly restrained by net foreign capital outflows. Considering a slowdown in inflation next year, moderation in economic growth, and already high levels of bank loans and investments, M2 growth is expected to return to the 2.5%-6.5% reference range in the second half of 2023. In the housing market, trading moderated this year. Building ownership transfers nationwide decreased by 4.5% year-on-year for the first ten months, while transfers in the six Special Municipalities dropped by 7% for the first eleven months. Construction costs for newly-built homes rose but at a slower pace. Prices of new and existing homes trended upward, reflecting the rise in the national Urban Land Price Index. In the third quarter, price indices for existing homes rose by 15.64%, and new housing projects saw a 33.73% price gain. The new housing project index reflects estimated prospective sale prices rather than actual transaction prices. Sentiment among builders and real estate businesses cooled significantly due to monetary tightening and government housing measures, while banks became cautious about the residential housing market outlook in major cities. As of October 2022, annual growth rates of real estate lending, housing loans, and construction loans edged down to 8.6%, 7.6%, and 12.18%, respectively. Real estate loans as a share of total loans slightly declined to 36.7% from 37.16% at the end of 2021. The construction loan ratio of domestic banks remained below the 30% cap prescribed in the Banking Act, standing at 26.63%. The ratio of non-performing housing loans extended by domestic banks remained low at 0.07%. Since the Bank deployed selective credit control measures through four amendments to relevant regulations starting in December 2020, banks’ loan portfolio concentration in the real estate sector has remained steady, supporting bank credit risk management. The Bank’s tightening stance since March 2022 has amplified the effectiveness of selective credit controls. Additionally, housing market trading has gradually slackened since the beginning of the year due to the government’s Healthy Real Estate Market Plan and the pandemic's impact. Cross-agency policy efforts toward a sound housing market have begun to show results. The annual growth rate of the consumer price index (CPI) rose to 3.59% in June before domestic inflation gradually slowed, reflecting price declines in international raw materials and domestic food items such as fruit and vegetables. The annual CPI growth rate stood at 2.35% in November, while the core CPI annual growth rate, excluding fruit, vegetables, and energy items, remained high at 2.86%. For the first eleven months of the year, the inflation rate averaged 2.97%, driven by rises in food, fuel and lubricants, rent, and durable goods, with core inflation averaging 2.6%. Since mid-year, the annual growth rates of import and producer price indices have moderated due to softening international raw material prices, relieving some pressures from imported inflation. The Bank forecasted inflation and core inflation rates for 2022 at 2.93% and 2.59%, respectively. For 2023, with global supply bottlenecks easing, lower international freight rates, and declining crude oil and other raw material prices, inflation and core inflation rates are forecasted to decline to 1.88% and 1.87%, respectively. Projections by domestic and foreign institutions place Taiwan’s annual CPI growth rate between 2.9% and 3.1% for 2022 and between 1.21% and 2.5% for 2023, with the average forecast for next year below 2%. Domestic price trends for next year could face upside pressures from increased overseas and domestic travel due to border reopening, the scheduled hike in minimum wages, and possible electricity and gas rate hikes. Conversely, downside pressures could come from lower international freight rates, a decline in raw material prices, and reductions in domestic prices of communication devices. The domestic inflation rate has declined in the second half of the year but could still register above 2% for the year overall, before dropping below 2% next year. Export expansion has significantly moderated, and the Bank revised down the economic growth forecast for 2022 to 2.91%, 0.6 percentage points lower than the previous forecast. For 2023, with increasing risks of a global economic slowdown affecting domestic export and investment growth, the Bank revised the forecast to 2.53%, a 0.37 percentage point reduction. The Bank decided to raise the discount rate, the rate on refinancing of secured loans, and the rate on temporary accommodations by 0.125 percentage points to 1.75%, 2.125%, and 4%, respectively. One board director noted that Taiwan’s inflation was not as high as in the US and Europe, partly because state-owned enterprises absorbed rising costs of electricity and oil. This prevented domestic prices from spiraling upward, though it resulted in significant losses for these enterprises. International oil prices are expected to decline, but liquefied natural gas prices remain elevated, and steam coal spot prices exceed contract prices. The extent to which electricity and gas pricing reflects true costs will have significant implications for monetary policymaking. Another board director highlighted Taiwan’s supply-side price stabilization measures, which were more effective than those in Europe and the US. Freezing electricity rates and mitigating oil price hikes contained price rises at the source, unlike subsidy policies implemented in Western countries. Aggressive rate hikes in Western economies dampened growth and impacted vulnerable households. Taiwan’s forecasts for CPI and core CPI to drop below 2% in 2023 already consider potential power tariff increases. One board director supported the 0.125 percentage point rate hike, noting it was appropriate given the projected CPI growth of over 2% this year and slightly below 2% next year. Although the Fed raised its rates by 0.5 percentage points, Taiwan’s moderate rate hike without a reserve requirement ratio (RRR) increase reflects a milder approach. With Taiwan’s export growth declining sharply and inflation still a concern, a 0.125 percentage point hike strikes the right balance. Another board director agreed, noting the interest rate differential with major central banks. Aggressive rate hikes by the Fed and ECB combat inflation, but Taiwan’s inflation trends and economic strains necessitate a more measured approach. While inflation and expectations are not as severe in Taiwan, exports have contracted for three consecutive months due to slowing global demand and inventory adjustments. The 0.125 percentage point hike avoids excessive pressure on economic growth. A board director emphasized that although inflation is expected to drop below 2%, inflationary pressures persist, with core inflation above 2% since March. Prolonged inflation could raise inflation expectations, necessitating proactive measures. While a rate hike is warranted, stronger arguments exist for a 0.25 percentage point hike. Another board director supported the 0.125 percentage point hike, balancing inflation pressures against an economy facing downside risks. In the US, a looming recession raises concerns about the impact of further aggressive Fed rate hikes. Europe faces energy price surges and tightening policies pushing its economy toward recession. In China, a surge in COVID-19 cases and inventory destocking sharply impacted corporate sales. The director supported a 0.125 percentage point rate hike. Another board director also supported raising the policy rates by 0.125 percentage points while leaving the RRR unchanged, stating that the move aligned with market expectations. The director highlighted that the annual growth rate of the monetary aggregate M2 continued to exceed 6.5%, the upper threshold of the Bank’s M2 growth reference range, and noted the widening interest rate differential between Taiwan and the US. One board director emphasized the importance of monetary policy adjustments in managing inflation expectations. Nominal earnings had risen markedly this year, exerting further pressure on inflation and potentially reflecting high inflation expectations. While higher inflation led to a contraction in real earnings, hurting household disposable income and potentially restraining consumption and investment, it is crucial to prevent inflation from accelerating. Prices for goods purchased frequently, especially staple items, had risen significantly, which heightened consumer sensitivity to price increases and fueled inflation expectations. Rising housing prices were also contributing to rent increases, impacting price stability. Furthermore, M2 growth had exceeded the Bank's reference range for 27 consecutive months, which might necessitate a review of the reference range. The director suggested communicating the Bank’s monetary policy stance to the public to demonstrate its commitment to addressing inflation. The director supported a larger rate hike of 0.25 percentage points and recommended employing alternative tools such as issuing certificates of deposits or raising policy rates for more effective interest rate transmission. Another board director pointed out that corporate pay-rise decisions were primarily influenced by employee performance and company profits rather than price trends. Domestic price increases were mainly due to supply-side shocks. However, Taiwan’s inflation was milder compared to the US and Europe, thanks to effective government supply-side measures and the spillover effects of aggressive monetary tightening by major central banks, which eased inflationary pressures in Taiwan. Regarding M2 growth, another director noted that the annual growth rate began exceeding the 6.5% threshold in August 2020, driven by the pandemic’s economic impacts and modest inflationary pressures at the time. High M2 growth was necessary to support the economy. This growth has recently moderated, with the exchange rate contributing to apparent increases due to the NT dollar depreciation. The director emphasized that M2 is a mid- to long-term indicator and suggested allowing more time before adjusting its reference range. A board director approved the 0.125 percentage point rate hike but also expressed support for a larger hike. While imported inflation concerns had subsided, potential inflationary pressures could arise from China’s reopening and consumption boom, which might increase supply chain costs and inflation. Despite the Bank’s lowered economic growth forecasts and projected decline in inflation, the Bank should monitor global supply chain developments and their impact on domestic prices. Another board director highlighted that export growth had slowed, with three consecutive months of contraction. Although economic expansion remained steady, indicators like the business climate monitor and leading indicators signaled high uncertainties. While headline inflation trended downwards, key staple goods and core inflation remained elevated, requiring close monitoring of inflation expectations. Compared to other economies, Taiwan’s inflation was mild and expected to drop below but close to 2%. The director deemed the 0.125 percentage point rate hike appropriate, considering the latest Fed rate hike of 0.5 percentage points. Another director noted that while inflation and core inflation rates were expected to drop below 2% next year, this projection was influenced by a higher base effect. Core inflation components like food away from home, rent, durable goods, meat, and apparel had experienced sustained price increases, making it difficult for core inflation to slow in the near future. Rising prices for agricultural products and energy items could further exacerbate inflation next year. Public concerns about inflationary pressures were evident from surveyed data, warranting close attention from the Bank. One board director cautioned that previous inflation forecasts by the Bank appeared overly optimistic and should be revisited. Taiwan’s milder inflation compared to other economies was largely due to government policy controls and underestimated rent costs in the CPI. Core inflation remained elevated, and slow rate hikes of 0.125 percentage points might not effectively contain inflation or mitigate inflation expectations. Historical lessons showed that insufficient monetary tightening could result in prolonged inflation and increase the risk of stagflation. Another board director remarked that the Bank’s gradual and mild approach to monetary tightening had been appropriate, given Taiwan’s relatively mild inflation. Gradual tightening helps achieve a soft economic landing, while excessive tightening risks triggering a recession and exacerbating difficulties for vulnerable populations. The proposed rate hike was based on domestic inflation readings and global economic factors. While inflationary pressures had eased recently, uncertainties surrounding inflation remain, and the Bank would adjust its monetary policy as needed. Regarding the overnight call loan rate, its role has diminished due to ample market liquidity conditions in Taiwan, unlike in the US, where the Federal Reserve uses the fed funds rate as its operational target for monetary policy. One board director noted that housing prices had surged dramatically this year, despite indications from the Bank and the industry that this reflected price-inelastic housing demand (e.g., owner-occupied housing) and rising construction costs. Even though the price index for construction works had significantly decreased since the beginning of the year, housing prices continued to rise. Bank loan portfolio concentration in real estate lending ticked down only modestly, and no new selective credit controls had been introduced since December 2021. Elevated property prices not only worsen housing affordability but also contribute to higher rental costs, driving inflation and raising concerns about financial stability. The director emphasized that high housing prices are linked to monetary policy. Research shows that Taiwan’s housing price cycle runs ahead of the credit cycle, suggesting that housing price increases are not primarily driven by bank credit growth. This could explain why the Bank’s selective credit controls have not been distinctly effective in curbing housing price gains. Speculative activities expecting price gains play a significant role in driving housing price increases. The Bank must address this issue directly and take committed efforts rather than relying solely on other authorities. Another board director pointed out that housing price trends must be assessed for their potential to cause financial instability, in line with the Bank’s mandate to safeguard financial stability. The selective credit controls aimed at mitigating the impact of housing credit on financial stability, rather than targeting housing prices directly. The director noted that property price surges were partly driven by supply-side cost increases due to labor and material shortages, as well as speculative transactions influenced by large corporate investment projects. The government’s Healthy Real Estate Market Plan, involving cross-agency efforts to address demand, supply, and institutional factors, aimed to mitigate these issues. The Bank contributed by implementing four rounds of selective credit controls, further reinforced by monetary tightening policies. Similarly, other major economies raised policy rates to combat high inflation, indirectly dampening housing prices. The director expressed hope for a soft landing in the housing market, noting that a hard landing could cause severe damage and require extensive policy measures to address, as seen in recent examples such as China’s property market crisis or Japan’s housing market crash in the late 1980s. The board directors decided to raise the discount rate, the rate on refinancing of secured loans, and the rate on temporary accommodations by 0.125 percentage points to 1.75%, 2.125%, and 4%, respectively. Since the Board last met in September, major economies have continued to tighten monetary policy, leading to significantly slower global growth. International commodity prices, including crude oil, have mostly declined, alleviating global inflationary pressures. With weakening global demand, easing supply chain bottlenecks, and declining raw material prices, global inflation is expected to moderate in the coming year. However, synchronized policy rate hikes by major central banks, including the Fed and the ECB, could further slow global growth, undermine financial stability, and heighten economic risks. Other factors, such as the US-China conflict, extreme weather events, the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, and the European energy crisis, add uncertainty to global inflation trends. Domestically, unemployment has decreased, private consumption is recovering, and the number of employed persons has edged up, thanks to diminishing pandemic impacts and lifted restrictions. However, weaker global demand and inventory destocking have led to three consecutive months of export contraction, dampening business sentiment and constraining private investment. The Bank expects economic growth to slow notably in the fourth quarter of this year and has downgraded Taiwan’s GDP growth forecast to 2.91% for the year. For 2023, loosened social restrictions and border controls may boost private consumption, but global economic slowdown and inventory overhangs are expected to weigh on export and private investment growth, moderating Taiwan’s economic expansion to 2.53%. Since mid-year, international prices of raw materials, including crude oil and grains, have softened, and domestic food prices, such as fruit and vegetables, have posted smaller gains. This has led to a downward trend in the annual growth rate of the CPI, which registered 2.35% in November. However, core CPI growth remained elevated at 2.86% in November. For the first eleven months, CPI and core CPI growth rates averaged 2.97% and 2.60%, respectively. The Bank forecasts inflation and core inflation rates for 2022 to be 2.93% and 2.59%. For 2023, as global supply chain gridlocks are resolved and raw material prices decline, the Bank projects the CPI and core CPI growth rates to drop to 1.88% and 1.87%, respectively. Banks’ excess reserves have averaged NT$60 billion in recent months. For the first ten months of the year, the annual growth rates of bank loans and investments and M2 were 7.55% and 7.54%, respectively. Monetary tightening measures have led to higher interest rates on bank deposits, loans, and money market instruments. The Board decided that a policy rate hike and continued monetary tightening will help rein in inflation expectations and promote price stability while supporting economic and financial stability. The Bank raised the discount rate, the rate on refinancing of secured loans, and the rate on temporary accommodations by 0.125 percentage points, effective December 16, 2022. Looking ahead, the Bank will closely monitor global and domestic economic and financial conditions, including monetary policy changes in major economies, raw material prices, geopolitical risks, and extreme weather events. Adjustments to monetary policy will be made as needed to maintain price and financial stability and foster economic growth. The Bank’s selective credit control measures, implemented through four amendments since December 2020, have bolstered credit risk management in the banking sector. Construction and housing loans have expanded at a slower pace, and real estate loan concentration has improved slightly. The effectiveness of these measures has been amplified by monetary tightening. Housing market transactions have decreased amid slower economic growth and government efforts under the Healthy Real Estate Market Plan. The Bank will continue to monitor housing credit and market developments and adjust measures as needed to ensure financial stability and sound banking operations. The NT dollar exchange rate remains determined by market forces. However, the Bank will intervene to maintain orderly market conditions if excessive volatility or disorderly movements arise due to factors such as massive short-term capital flows, which could adversely affect economic and financial stability.
