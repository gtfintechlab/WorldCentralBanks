    "2022": [
        "Since  the  second  quarter  this  year,  the  U.S.,  the  euro  area,  and  China  had  all \nexperienced economic slowdown.",
        "Global manufacturing expansion sputtered, business \nsentiment of major economies became more cautious about the economic outlook, and \ndecreasing  new  orders  and  increasing  inventories  also  pointed  to  weaker  demand  for \ngoods  consumption  worldwide.",
        "Amid  the  global  economic  moderation  and  sluggish \ntrade growth, supply chain bottlenecks had begun to ease and freight fees had dropped \nsignificantly  from  the  peaks.",
        "However,  the  world  continued  to witness  elevated \ninflation, many economies including the U.S. and Europe continued hiking policy rates \nand financial conditions were tight.",
        "It was projected that global economic growth would \nsoften  this  year,  with  international  institutions  downgrading  their  forecasts  for  the \nworld’s GDP growth rate in 2022 and expecting a further slowdown in 2023.",
        "Regarding  commodity  prices,  oil  prices  had  swung  downwards  since  July  2022, \nagainst a background of the European Union allowing Russia to export its crude oil to \neconomies  outside  the  EU,  OPEC+  agreeing  to  increase  oil  output,  and  a  global \neconomic moderation  dampening  demand for  crude  oil.",
        "International  institutions \nforecasted this year’s oil prices would exceed the levels of last year then edge down next \nyear.",
        "The Reuters/Jefferies CRB (RJ/CRB) Index, the global commodities benchmark, \nfell in recent months from a previous high and fluctuated within a narrow range.",
        "Surging  energy  and  food  prices  have  kept  inflation  in  major  economies  at  high \nlevels  this  year  so  far.",
        "Nevertheless,  given  the  monetary  tightening  actions  by  most \nmajor central banks and a recent  decline in energy prices, the world would likely see \nnext year’s inflation come down from previous highs.",
        "While the U.S., Europe and many \nother economies carried on with policy rate hikes to tame high inflation, Japan and China \nremained accommodative.",
        "In terms of international financial market trends since August 2022, as the Federal \nReserve (Fed) and the European Central Bank (ECB) signaled for further tightening, the \nU.S. and German10-year government bond yields both rebounded.",
        "Major stock markets \nexperienced  turbulence  in  recent  months  in  response  to  U.S.  inflation  data  and  Fed \npolicy paths.",
        "The DXY index set a new record high in more than 20 years, leading major \ncurrencies to depreciate against the US dollar.",
        "Looking ahead, the global economy  faces  multiple downside risks, including the \nfollowing: (1) Aggressive tightening by major central banks including the Fed and the \nECB,  roiling  global  financial  markets  and  depressing  economic  activity  worldwide, \nheightening the risk of defaults by countries with high levels of external debt; (2) the \nRussia-Ukraine  war  continuing  on,  taking  a  toll  on  the  European  economy  amid  the \nresulting energy crisis and hurting political and economic stability amid financial market \nturbulence; (3) China’s “zero-COVID” policy posing a threat to the easing of global \nsupply  chain  bottlenecks,  and  the  real  estate  market  pressures  destabilizing  global \nfinancial stability.",
        "In addition, geopolitical risks, extreme weather events, and pandemic \nwaves also cast a long shadow over the global economic outlook.",
        "In recent months, the domestic economic expansion moderated, with both leading \nand coincident indicators for business outlook on a downtrend.",
        "Manufacturing and non-\nmanufacturing sentiment for the outlook for the next six months also became cautious.",
        "In terms of external demand since July 2022, robust demand for integrated circuits \nand  mineral  products  counteracted  by  global  final  demand  losing  steam  led  export \ngrowth to slow down year on year, registering 2% in August.",
        "Looking ahead, emerging \ntechnology applications and digital transformation would continue supporting demand \nand extend the gains in related supply chain exports.",
        "However, with major central banks \ntightening  further  and  external  demand  cooling  down,  Taiwan  could  witness  slowing \ngrowth  momentum  for  its  exports.",
        "Overall,  the  Bank  projected  exports  to  post  solid \ngrowth this year and slower growth next year.",
        "In respect of domestic demand, private investment grew at a slower pace mainly \nbecause  raw  material  shortfalls  resulted  in  an  extension  of  equipment  delivery  time, \nwhile labor shortage and inventory adjustments as well as a cautious economic outlook \nprompted some firms to postpone capital expenditure plans.",
        "The Bank expected private \ninvestment to still post steady growth this year and slower growth next year.",
        "In  terms  of  private  consumption,  growth  momentum  strengthened,  as  an  abated \ndomestic  pandemic  and  the  government’s  domestic  tourism  stimulus  measures \nencouraged  consumers  to  spend  and  travel.",
        "The  Bank  projected  private  consumption \ngrowth to be mild this year and to gather pace next year.",
        "With the pandemic’s impact diminishing at home, the number of employed persons \nincreased by 0.29% year on year in July.",
        "The unemployment rate rose to 3.78% in July \nowing  to  seasonal  factors,  but  the  seasonally-adjusted  figure  was  3.68%,  declining  to \nthe level before the domestic COVID-19 resurgence in April this year.",
        "This also showed \nthat labor market conditions were picking up.",
        "Overall, while the previous pandemic impacts had eased, the global economy could \nincreasingly  face greater downside risks, and domestic firms were conservative  about \nthe economic outlook.",
        "In this view, the Bank revised the GDP growth rate forecasts to \n3.51%  this  year  and  2.90%  next  year.",
        "The  growth  projections  by  major  institutions \nranged between 2.60% and 3.81% for this year and between 1.90% and 3.41% for next \nyear.",
        "(2) Financial conditions   \nDomestic long and short-term interest rates went upwards as the Bank’s hikes in \npolicy  rates  and  the  reserve  requirement  ratios  (RRRs)  took  effect  in  June  and  July, \nrespectively.",
        "As  for  excess  reserves,  the  total  amount  as  held  by  all  banks  stood  at  a \nlevel over NT$60 billion in recent months.",
        "In July, short-term market rates and bank deposit rates both rose by more than 0.125 \npercentage  points  –  the  size  of  the  June  hike  in  policy  rates,  a  testament  of  direct \ntransmission from the policy rate hike to the market.",
        "Bank loans and investments had gradually slowed  month by  month to an annual \ngrowth rate of 6.55% in July, mainly because of an increase in government tax revenue, \ngovernment  repaying  the  borrowings,  and  banks  scaling  back  investments  owing  to \nfunding needs and foreign capital outflows.",
        "The annual growth rate edged up in August, \nthough, buoyed by greater demand of government enterprises for funding.",
        "In terms of \nmoney supply, reflecting the slowdown in bank loans and investments and a  year-on-\nyear increase of foreign capital outflows, as well as the Bank’s hikes of policy rates and \nthe RRRs, the M2 annual growth rate had trended downwards since May this year, with \nthe pace of growth averaging 7.66% for the first eight months of the year.",
        "In the housing market, trading had moderated in the year so far.",
        "During the period \nof  January  to  July,  the  total  number  of  building  ownership  transfers  nationwide \ndecreased by 1.64% compared to the same period last year, while that number for the \nsix  Special  Municipalities  nudged  up  by  0.2%  for  the  first  eight  months  of  year.",
        "Construction  costs  for  newly-built  homes  continued  climbing  but  at  a  slower  pace.",
        "Prices of new housing units were trending up, reflecting the rise in national Urban Land \nPrice Index (compiled by the Ministry of the Interior) in March 2022.",
        "The price indices \nfor existing homes and new housing projects rose further by 14.77% and 34.72% in the \nsecond quarter of the year.",
        "Meanwhile, affected by the domestic pandemic resurgence \nand the Bank’s policy measures, recent sentiment-related data showed that builders and \nreal  estate  businesses  turned  cautious  about  the  housing  market  outlook,  while  banks \nbecame less optimistic about the outlook of residential housing in major cities.",
        "As of the end of July 2022, the annual growth rates of real estate lending, housing \nloans, and construction loans edged down to 9.46%, 8.64%, and 12.53%, respectively.",
        "Real estate loans as a share of total loans  slightly shrank to 37.07% from the 37.16% \nregistered  at  the  end  of  last  year.",
        "Meanwhile,  the  construction  loan  ratio  of  domestic \nbanks was 27.05%, still below the 30% cap prescribed in Article 72-2 of the Banking \nAct.2  The ratio of non-performing housing loans extended by domestic banks remained \nlow at 0.08%.",
        "Since  the  Bank  deployed  selective  credit  control  measures  by making  four \namendments to relevant regulations from December 2020 onwards, banks’  loan \nportfolio concentration in the real estate sector had kept steady, which was conducive to \nbank credit risk management.",
        "The Bank’s tightening stance since March 2022 was also \nAccording to Article 72-2 of the Banking Act, the total amount of loans extended for residential construction \nand construction for business purposes by a Commercial Bank shall not exceed thirty percent (30%) of the \naggregate of such Commercial Bank's deposits and Bank Debentures issued at the time such loans is extended.",
        "judged  to  amplify  the  effectiveness  of  selective  credit  controls.",
        "In  addition,  housing \nmarket trading had started to slacken since the beginning of the year as a result of the \nconcerted efforts under the  government’s Healthy Real Estate  Market Plan as well as \nthe pandemic’s impact; given time, more results of the policy efforts are expected to \nshow.",
        "(3) Price trends   \nIn  the  year  to  date,  Taiwan  had  suffered  considerable  pressures  of  imported \ninflation owing to global supply chain bottlenecks and the Russia-Ukraine war pushing \nup  international  grain  and  energy  prices.",
        "More  recently,  though,  as  international  raw \nmaterial prices softened and domestic food price rises were also slowed by declines in \nvegetable prices, the annual growth rate of the consumer price index (CPI) dropped from \n3.36% in July to 2.66% in August and that of the core CPI edged down to 2.73%.",
        "For the first eight months of the year, the annual CPI growth rate averaged 3.10%, \nmainly  owing  to  rising  prices  for  food,  fuel  and  lubricants,  consumer  durables,  and \nresidential rent.",
        "As there was a more marked increase in prices of staples with a higher \npurchase frequency, consumers tended to be more conscious of upward price trends.",
        "Recent data on multiple inflation-related indicators all pointed to a prospective ease \nin domestic inflationary pressures.",
        "Spot crude oil prices already dropped from previous \nhighs and would likely trend down steadily in the future, while international commodity \nfutures also saw price corrections.",
        "The import price index and the producer price index \nalso gradually came down.",
        "As for the NT dollar depreciation’s impact on domestic price \ntrends, it remained within manageable range: If the NTD-USD exchange rate came from \nthe  2021  average  of  28.02  to  the  estimated  2022  average  of  29.5  (representing  a \ndepreciation of 5.02%), this year’s CPI annual growth rate would rise by 0.12  -  0.25 \npercentage points; if the exchange rate came to 30 (a depreciation of 6.60%), the effect \non the CPI annual growth rate would edge up to a rise by 0.16 - 0.33 percentage points.",
        "Given the decline in international raw material prices and a higher base effect, the \nannual CPI growth rate was expected to gradually come down from the third quarter of \nthe year onwards.",
        "Looking ahead to next year, as global supply chain bottlenecks ease, \nglobal  freight  rates  trend  low,  and  international  raw  material  prices  continue  with  a \ndownswing, domestic inflation would likely decrease to below 2%.",
        "The Bank forecasted \nthe annual growth rate of the CPI and the core CPI to register 2.95% and 2.52% for 2022 \nand  to  decline  to  1.88%  and  1.87%  for  2023.",
        "Projections for Taiwan’s annual  CPI \ngrowth rate made by major forecasting institutions  ranged between 2.85% and 3.30% \nfor 2022 and between 1.30% and 2.40% for 2023, with the forecast average below 2% \nfor next year.",
        "Looking ahead, upside pressures for domestic prices could arise from (1) \ndownward price stickiness (i.e., “easy  to rise but hard to fall”) in some items of the \nservices category, including food away from home and residential rent; (2) the easing of \nborder controls leading to hikes in airfares and travel group fees; (3) greater demand for \ndomestic travel as concerns over pandemic waves diminished, and the resulting rise in \nprices for hotels and accommodation; (4) the planned hike of minimum wages next year.",
        "On the other hand, downside pressures could come from (1) an expected softening of \ncrude  oil  and  other  raw  material  prices  in  the  second  half  of  the  year;  (2)  lower \ninternational freight rates as supply chain bottlenecks ease; (3) telecom operators cutting \nprices of mobile phones and other communication devices amid intense competition.",
        "Since  the beginning of  this year,  the U.S.,  Europe, and  some  Asia-Pacific \neconomies had aggressively raised their policy rates to tame relatively higher \ninflationary pressures.",
        "Taiwan’s price uptrends were similar to Japan and China;  the \nBank of Japan  maintained an accommodative  monetary  policy  stance and China’s \ncentral bank even reduced policy rates, whereas the Bank continued with a tightening \nstance with gradual rate hikes.",
        "Major considerations:   \n(1) The domestic inflation rate is likely to gradually come down in the second half of the \nyear, but could still register above 2% for the year as a whole before declining to below \n2% next year.",
        "(2) The domestic economy is expected to see growth moderating to a pace slower than \n3% next year.",
        "(1) Spillover effects from the global economic downturn and tight financial conditions:   \nAs major economies including the U.S. and Europe take big steps in monetary \ntightening and global financial conditions become tighter, global economic growth is \nexpected to slow in 2022 and 2023 and faces heightened downside risk.",
        "As a small \nopen economy, Taiwan could be impacted by spillover effects via the following three \nchannels:   \nThe real economy: With global final demand weakening, Taiwan’s exports have \nseen  slower  growth  in  recent  months  and  private  investment  has  turned \nconservative.",
        "The domestic GDP growth rate is projected by the Bank to slow to \nbelow 3% next year, which would also take some heat off domestic inflation.",
        "Prices: Global economic slowdown, declines in crude oil and other raw material \nprices on tepid demand, and lower international freight rates on the easing of global \nsupply chain bottlenecks would combine to help mitigate pressures from imported \ninflation.",
        "Finance: As the Fed continues with rate hikes and global stock markets slump on \nconcern about a global recession, Taiwan’s stock markets would experience more \nvolatile downswings along with massive foreign capital outflows, and domestic \nfinancial conditions could tighten further.",
        "(2) The government’s continued efforts to implement supply-side measures in response \nto fluctuations in energy and food prices, providing substantial support for sustaining \noverall price stability:   \nA.",
        "Continued adjustments, as seen needed, of the tariff reduction measures, including \ncommodity taxes on gasoline, diesel, and cement, and tariffs on beef, formula milk, \nbutter, and wheat; an extension of business tax exemption on imported soybeans, \nwheat, and corns.",
        "A freeze on electricity tariff adjustments for the second half of the year, as per the \nresolution of the government’s review committee for electricity tariffs.",
        "(3) The Bank’s approach of simultaneously affecting price (interest rate) and quantity \n(money stock) with hikes in both the policy rates and the RRRs, helping to rein in \ndomestic inflation expectations:   \nA.",
        "Reflecting the policy rate hikes, long and short-term market rates have gone \nupwards and financial conditions have broadly tightened.",
        "The RRR increase is expected to reinforce money and credit management and slow \ndown monetary growth: As banks are required to set aside more reserves, their \ncredit creation capacity would be restrained, helping to keep M2 growth at an \nappropriate pace.",
        "In recent months, the annual growth rate of M2 has declined, \nwith the rate averaging 7.66% for the first eight months of the year – still higher \nthan the 6.5% upper threshold of the Bank’s reference range.",
        "If the RRRs are to be \nraised further in the future, M2 growth would likely soften more markedly, which \ncould amplify the effect of denting inflation expectations.",
        "Policy Propositions: To raise the discount rate, the rate on refinancing of secured \nloans, and the rate on temporary accommodations by 0.125 percentage points to \n1.625%, 2%, and 3.875%, respectively; and to increase the reserve requirement \nratios  on  NT  dollar  demand  deposits  and  time  (savings)  deposits  by  0.25 \npercentage points, respectively.",
        "Board members decided to raise the policy rates by 0.125 percentage points each \nand  reached  a  unanimous  vote  to  increase  the  reserve  requirement  ratios  on  NT \ndollar  demand  deposits  and  time  (savings)  deposits  by  0.25  percentage  points.",
        "One  board  director  stated  that  inflation  has  become  a  challenge  to  central  banks \naround  the  world,  with  all  major  economies  except  Japan  and  China  commencing  a \nmonetary tightening cycle.",
        "However, the Fed’s aggressive rate hikes could heighten the \nrisk of a hard landing and further roil the financial markets.",
        "By contrast, Taiwan does \nfighting message to rein in expectations.",
        "Another board director expressed the view that a 0.125 percentage point rate hike \nwas  rather  mild.",
        "With  international  sea  transport  gridlock  thawing  and  global  energy \nprices softening, domestic inflationary pressures would likely ease.",
        "Against this \nbackground, while considering potential impact on homebuyers’ interest burden, the \ndirector supported the 0.125 percentage point hike in policy rates.",
        "Regarding the RRR \nincrease proposition,  given that the  M2 annual growth rate remained above the upper \nlimit  (6.5%)  of  the  Bank’s  reference  range,  the  director  also  agreed  with  a  0.25 \npercentage point RRR hike.",
        "Another board director showing support for the two propositions also pointed out \nthe following.",
        "Ocean freight rates pushed up by the pandemic have come down.",
        "While \nUkrainian grain exports hampered by the war have been easing somewhat, many of their \ncrop areas were no longer arable; combined with adverse weather conditions (such as \ndroughts)  in  other  major  food  commodity  exporters,  feed  prices  remained  elevated, \nwhich could affect domestic prices of eggs and meat and impact the CPI trends.",
        "Under \nthe  circumstances,  a  policy  rate  hike  would  somewhat  relieve  household  burdens \nassociated with rising food prices; on the other hand, it could add to funding costs for \nhousing and credit loans, hence the need to take into account the potential influences of \npolicy rate hikes in terms of the size.",
        "One board director, in favor of both of the propositions, stated that despite steady \neconomic  growth,  the  National  Development  Council’s Monitoring Indicator had in \nrecent months descended to the lower threshold of the “stable” signal range, the Leading \nIndicators  had  trended  further  downwards,  and  exports  had  also  showed  signs  of \nweakening.",
        "While Taiwan’s inflation was mild relative to other major economies, it was \npartly  sustained  by  tariff  and  tax  control  measures  aiming  at  restraining  raw  material \nprices.",
        "If the war in Ukraine rages on and extreme weather conditions lack \nimprovements, domestic inflation might not see meaningful declines; continued \nmonitoring  should  be  warranted.",
        "The  director  gave  the  reason  for  supporting  a  0.125 \npercentage  point  rate  hike,  citing  the  consideration  that  higher  policy  rates  affect  the \nentire economy instead of specific segments, including posing an impact on borrowers’ \ninterest  payments.",
        "Still, the director recognized the importance to convey the Bank’s \ntightening stance.",
        "The RRR increase by 0.25 percentage point would affect money stock \nwith a powerful punch.",
        "In order to help anchor inflation expectations at a lower level, \nthe Bank should communicate its stance in a clear and unequivocal way.",
        "One board director pointed out the relatively lower inflation in Taiwan was mainly \ndue  to  government  efforts  to  reduce  tariff  and  commodity  tax  rates  and  keep  down \nelectricity and oil prices through state-owned businesses, both of which were temporary \nmeasures.",
        "The director did not see the inflation rate to decline to below 2% in the second \nhalf of 2022 and in the year of 2023.",
        "Against a background of bold rate hikes by major \ncentral  banks  and  a  projected  domestic  inflation  rate  of  nearly  3%,  the  fact  that  the \nBank’s policy rates were only 0.25 percentage points higher than before the pandemic \nmight not favorably affect inflation expectations.",
        "As for the RRR increase, it is a tool \nseldom used because it usually strikes hard and fast, but there would be two consecutive \n0.25 percentage point RRR increases in Taiwan after today’s meeting; the Bank needs \nto indicate the actual effects of such a tool on the inflation rate.",
        "Another board director pointed to the complex international economic and financial \nconditions recently.",
        "Many  major central banks continued to raise their policy  rates to \ntackle inflation whereas some economies still kept an accommodative monetary policy \nstance or even reduced rates.",
        "Being key players in the world, these economies’ policies \ncarry  a  weight  on  the  global  economic  and  financial  scenes.",
        "At  the  current  juncture, \ninternational uncertainties remain, the war in Ukraine continues, and the future outlook \nis clouded, therefore the director agreed to a  policy hike  but at a  measured pace.",
        "The \nFed’s aggressive hikes came with a worrying economic outlook; if the U.S. economy \nhas  a  hard  landing,  then  Taiwan  could,  in  the  following  six  months,  sustain  injury  in \nmany  aspects  including  investment,  consumption,  and  exports,  a  consideration  that \nwarranted the director’s support for a 0.125 percentage point rate hike.",
        "As for the \nproposed RRR increase by 0.25 percentage points, it would not bring about too much a \nhit given the enormous scale of Taiwan’s excess reserves now.",
        "(2) Discussions on housing prices, residential rent, and consumer price measurement \nOne board director noted that although tax policies may be the most effective tool \nto tamp down housing prices, as repeatedly stressed by the Bank and supported by some \nresearches, this does not keep monetary authorities on the sidelines when housing prices \ncontinue to surge.",
        "For the Bank to safeguard financial stability, it needs to take policy \nactions in response to housing price changes.",
        "For instance, according to some \neconomists  at  the  Bank  for  International  Settlements,  housing  prices  in  South  Korea \nhave dropped significantly since its central bank began a series of rate hikes last year.",
        "By contrast, it is wrong when the Bank pays great attention to indicators like housing \ncredit growth and concentration but not enough emphasis on price changes.",
        "Another  board  director  pointed  out  that  information  on  housing  price  trends  are \nreflected in the Bank’s publications, internal reports, quarterly Board Meeting reference \nmaterials, etc., indicating that the Bank has been keeping close watch.",
        "Indicators such \nas  housing  credit  growth  and  concentration  would  reveal  the  trends  in  housing  prices \nand  housing  market  trading.",
        "Moreover,  though  being  closely  watched  by  the  Bank, \nhousing prices as an indicator does not in itself necessitate a systemic policy response.",
        "Indeed,  housing  prices  has  a  role  in  financial  stability  but  it  is  also  affected  by  many \nfactors.",
        "The Bank’s response measures were meant to stem market speculation and \nprevent credit resources from gushing into the real estate sector.",
        "When housing prices \nare bolstered by economic fundamentals, the ensuing price rises would not be interfered \nwith unless financial stability becomes compromised.",
        "The Bank tackles housing market \nrisks with selective credit control measures.",
        "The primary purpose of a policy rate hike \nis to combat inflation, with concomitant effects on housing prices; this is the same in the \ncases of rate hike decisions by other economies (including the U.S., South Korea, the \nU.K., and the euro area) as they aim at high inflation instead of housing prices.",
        "Another board director remarked that with domestic housing prices going higher in \nthe second quarter this year, today’s rate hike would also help put the brakes on those \nprice rises.",
        "In addition, since the Bank had already sent out messages of beginning a rate \nhike cycle, gradual hikes should not markedly increase mortgage borrowers’ burdens \nwhile still conveying the Bank’s gradual tightening stance.",
        "Two board directors remarked on housing prices, rent, and CPI measurement.",
        "One \nof them suggested that costs of housing should be reflected in the CPI statistics; the other \ncited examples of other central banks: The Fed chairman showed concerns about how \nrising  home  prices  could  lead  to  rent  rises  and  thus  push  up  inflation;  the  ECB  had \nseveral years ago contemplated incorporating owner-occupied housing (OOH) prices in \nthe  CPI.",
        "Though  such  a  concept  has  not  been  adopted  in  the  official  CPI  program,  it \nindicates  the kind of thought given to OOH prices – in addition to rent – in that their \nincreases may have a potential effect on the CPI.",
        "One supervisor stated that according to the DGBAS, who is responsible for CPI \nstatistics compilation in Taiwan, residential rent has a weight of about 15%, while the \nU.S. assigns a higher weight to rent (above 30%) and the sample of housing units are \nfor urban U.S. Across many countries, data show that housing prices have posted larger \nincreases than rents.",
        "When home prices go up, prospective purchases would take into \naccount buyers’ income and affordability, whereas rent surveys for CPI statistics reflect \nonly the price factor.",
        "The international norm for CPI compilation is to seek to reflect the \nchange in the cost of buying a fixed basket of goods and services of constant quality, \nwhereas changes (such as improvements) in the quality or rises in the prices of a home \nproperty are not included in the CPI measurement.",
        "And the CPI data compiled by the \nDGBAS only measure the changes in residential rent, but not housing prices.",
        "Recently, \nresidential rent seemed to be trending upwards,  and that uptrend was indicated by the \nDGBAS’ CPI data using a compilation approach in line with the international principles.",
        "Regarding  the  previously  mentioned  idea  of  incorporating  housing  prices  into  CPI \ncompilation,  the  supervisor  noted  that  this  was  simply  one  of  the  suggestions  once \nfloated  by  the  ECB,  and  currently  there  are  no  countries  directly  including  housing \nprices in their CPI measurement.",
        "One board director noted that the DGBAS is Taiwan’s CPI compiler and follows \nthe international principles; the institution’s authority and efforts deserve respect.",
        "Most \ncountries, including the U.S. and Japan, use the “rental equivalence” approach; their rent \nis generally less susceptible to housing price changes, showing a more stable trend with \nlittle deviation from the CPI.",

        "Since the Board met in June this year, growth in the US, the euro area, and China \nhas moderated, prices of commodities such as international crude oil have trended \ndownward,  and  global  supply  chain  bottlenecks  have  gradually  eased,  whereas \nglobal inflation remains at high levels.",
        "With most economies including the US and \nthe European economies continuing with policy rate hikes, leading to a tightening \nof financial conditions, growth momentum for the global economy is expected to \nsoften and international institutions have downgraded their forecasts for the 2022 \nglobal economic growth.",

        "The US dollar has strengthened, with the \ninternational  US  Dollar  Index  reaching  a  20-year  high  and  major  economies' \ncurrencies all depreciating against the US dollar.",
        "Looking ahead, the global economy faces multiple downside risks, including the \nfollowing: (1) aggressive monetary policy tightening by the US and the European \neconomies inducing tighter international financial conditions, which could weigh \non global economic activity; (2) the energy crisis fueled by the ongoing Russia-\nUkraine war dragging down economic growth in Europe; (3) China's zero-COVID \npolicy  affecting  the  easing  of  global  supply  chain  bottlenecks  and  its  real  estate \ntroubles  undermining  financial  stability.",

        "The  pandemic's  impact  on  the  labor  market  has  waned.",
        "The  July  2022  figures \nshowed that the number of employed persons increased by 0.29% year on year; the \nunemployment  rate  rose  to  3.78%  owing  to  seasonal  factors  but  the  seasonally-\nadjusted rate came in at 3.68%, returning to the level before the domestic COVID-\n19 flare-up in April this year.",

        "Given  the  recent  international \ncommodity  price  decline,  the  domestic  inflation  rate  is  expected  to  come  down gradually in the second half of the year, while registering above 2% for the year as \na  whole  before  dropping  below  2%  next  year.",
        "Moreover,  with  a  slowing  global \neconomy  compounded  by  greater  downside  risk  in  the  second  half  of  the  year \nthrough to next year, it is expected that the domestic economic growth momentum \nwould  weaken  next  year.",
        "The  Board  judged  that,  by  continuing  with  policy  rate \nhikes  while  also  raising  the  reserve  requirement  ratios,  it  would  help  rein  in \ndomestic inflation expectations, maintain price stability, and help attain the policy \nobjectives of fostering sound economic and financial development.",
        "At  the  meeting  today,  the  Board  decided  to  raise  the  discount  rate,  the  rate  on \nrefinancing of secured loans, and the rate on temporary accommodations by 0.125 \npercentage  points  each  to  1.625%,  2%,  and  3.875%,  respectively,  effective \nSeptember 23, 2022.",

        "The  Bank  may  adjust  its  monetary  policy \naccordingly in a timely manner as warranted, so as to fulfill the statutory duties of \nmaintaining  financial  and  price  stability,  and  fostering  economic  development \nwithin the scope of the above objectives.",
        "The  Bank's  selective  credit  control  measures,  implemented  with  four  successive \namendments  from  December  2020,  have  so  far  successfully  bolstered  credit  risk \nmanagement  of  the  banking  sector.",
        "In  the  year  so  far,  banks'  construction  and \nhousing  loans  have  expanded  at  a  slower  pace,  real  estate  loan  concentration  has \nbeen  broadly  steady,  and  the  level  of  non-performing  loan  ratio  for  real  estate \nlending has been low.",
        "The effectiveness of the existing credit controls would also \nhave been amplified by the Bank's monetary policy tightening.",
        "In addition, housing \nmarket transactions have been dampened somewhat in the year to date as a result of \nthe government's cross-agency efforts under the Healthy  Real Estate Market Plan and the pandemic flare-up in recent months.",

        "Since the Board last met in September 2022, the effects from the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, elevated inflation, and monetary policy tightening by major economies have markedly dampened global goods consumption demand, causing firms to receive fewer orders and inventories to pile up, putting a drag on global economic growth.",
        "With tepid demand for goods, world trade expansion weakened, while supply chain snags continued to ease and shipping rates dropped considerably.",
        "As major economies such as the US and Europe still recorded high inflation and many central banks significantly tightened monetary policy, global economic growth is expected to slow further in 2023, with the US and Europe likely entering mild recessions.",
        "From October onwards, oil prices dropped to levels last seen prior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine as international institutions downgraded their projections for global crude oil demand growth and US crude oil production increased.",

        "In foreign exchange markets, the US Dollar Index traded significantly lower since November as US inflation posted lower-than-expected numbers for two consecutive months and the Federal Reserve was thought to slow the pace of rate hikes.",
        "Major currencies broadly strengthened against the US dollar.",
        "Hopes of smaller Fed rate increases and concerns about a looming European recession caused US and German 10-year government bond yields to fall, while global stock markets rallied.",
        "Looking ahead, the global economy faces multiple downside risks: synchronized monetary policy tightening could deepen the global economic slowdown and undermine financial stability; implications from US-China disputes could hamper the process of globalization; geopolitical risks could disrupt supply chain networks; the Russia-Ukraine war and the ensuing energy crisis in Europe could add to global economic headwinds; and extreme weather events and energy transition efforts could both be inflationary.",
        "The leading and coincident indicators extended their downtrends recently.",
        "Manufacturing and non-manufacturing sentiment for the outlook for the next six months remained cautious.",
        "Since August 2022, exports were impacted by cooling global final demand and inventory adjustments by foreign firms, resulting in a year-on-year contraction of 13.1% in November, marking the third consecutive month of negative growth.",

        "Commercial paper interest rates rose more steeply than the policy rate hike, showing a strong transmission effect from monetary policy.",
        "The annual growth rate of bank loans and investments rose steadily since August due to strong private sector demand for working capital and increased government enterprise expenditures.",
        "The growth rate stood at 6.75% at the end of October and averaged 7.55% for the first ten months of the year.",
        "The RRR increase beginning in July led banks to set aside more reserves, reducing their disposable funds.",
        "A net foreign capital outflow further slowed M2 growth, which increased year-on-year by 6.83% in September.",
        "Despite another RRR increase, M2 annual growth rose to 7.32% in October due to foreign investor portfolio inflows and faster growth in bank loans and investments.",
        "M2 growth averaged 7.54% in the first ten months, exceeding the Bank’s reference range of 6.5%.",
        "This was driven by fast bank loans and investments growth but was partly restrained by net foreign capital outflows.",
        "Considering a slowdown in inflation next year, moderation in economic growth, and already high levels of bank loans and investments, M2 growth is expected to return to the 2.5%-6.5% reference range in the second half of 2023.",

        "The ratio of non-performing housing loans extended by domestic banks remained low at 0.07%.",
        "Since the Bank deployed selective credit control measures through four amendments to relevant regulations starting in December 2020, banks’ loan portfolio concentration in the real estate sector has remained steady, supporting bank credit risk management.",
        "The Bank’s tightening stance since March 2022 has amplified the effectiveness of selective credit controls.",
        "Additionally, housing market trading has gradually slackened since the beginning of the year due to the government’s Healthy Real Estate Market Plan and the pandemic's impact.",
        "Cross-agency policy efforts toward a sound housing market have begun to show results.",

        "For the first eleven months of the year, the inflation rate averaged 2.97%, driven by rises in food, fuel and lubricants, rent, and durable goods, with core inflation averaging 2.6%.",
        "Since mid-year, the annual growth rates of import and producer price indices have moderated due to softening international raw material prices, relieving some pressures from imported inflation.",
        "The Bank forecasted inflation and core inflation rates for 2022 at 2.93% and 2.59%, respectively.",
        "For 2023, with global supply bottlenecks easing, lower international freight rates, and declining crude oil and other raw material prices, inflation and core inflation rates are forecasted to decline to 1.88% and 1.87%, respectively.",
        "Projections by domestic and foreign institutions place Taiwan’s annual CPI growth rate between 2.9% and 3.1% for 2022 and between 1.21% and 2.5% for 2023, with the average forecast for next year below 2%.",
        "Domestic price trends for next year could face upside pressures from increased overseas and domestic travel due to border reopening, the scheduled hike in minimum wages, and possible electricity and gas rate hikes.",
        "Conversely, downside pressures could come from lower international freight rates, a decline in raw material prices, and reductions in domestic prices of communication devices.",

        "The Bank decided to raise the discount rate, the rate on refinancing of secured loans, and the rate on temporary accommodations by 0.125 percentage points to 1.75%, 2.125%, and 4%, respectively.",
        "One board director noted that Taiwan’s inflation was not as high as in the US and Europe, partly because state-owned enterprises absorbed rising costs of electricity and oil.",
        "This prevented domestic prices from spiraling upward, though it resulted in significant losses for these enterprises.",
        "International oil prices are expected to decline, but liquefied natural gas prices remain elevated, and steam coal spot prices exceed contract prices.",
        "The extent to which electricity and gas pricing reflects true costs will have significant implications for monetary policymaking.",
        "Another board director highlighted Taiwan’s supply-side price stabilization measures, which were more effective than those in Europe and the US.",
        "Freezing electricity rates and mitigating oil price hikes contained price rises at the source, unlike subsidy policies implemented in Western countries.",
        "Aggressive rate hikes in Western economies dampened growth and impacted vulnerable households.",
        "Taiwan’s forecasts for CPI and core CPI to drop below 2% in 2023 already consider potential power tariff increases.",
        "One board director supported the 0.125 percentage point rate hike, noting it was appropriate given the projected CPI growth of over 2% this year and slightly below 2% next year.",
        "Although the Fed raised its rates by 0.5 percentage points, Taiwan’s moderate rate hike without a reserve requirement ratio (RRR) increase reflects a milder approach.",
        "With Taiwan’s export growth declining sharply and inflation still a concern, a 0.125 percentage point hike strikes the right balance.",
        "Another board director agreed, noting the interest rate differential with major central banks.",
        "Aggressive rate hikes by the Fed and ECB combat inflation, but Taiwan’s inflation trends and economic strains necessitate a more measured approach.",
        "While inflation and expectations are not as severe in Taiwan, exports have contracted for three consecutive months due to slowing global demand and inventory adjustments.",
        "The 0.125 percentage point hike avoids excessive pressure on economic growth.",
        "A board director emphasized that although inflation is expected to drop below 2%, inflationary pressures persist, with core inflation above 2% since March.",
        "Prolonged inflation could raise inflation expectations, necessitating proactive measures.",
        "While a rate hike is warranted, stronger arguments exist for a 0.25 percentage point hike.",
        "Another board director supported the 0.125 percentage point hike, balancing inflation pressures against an economy facing downside risks.",
        "In the US, a looming recession raises concerns about the impact of further aggressive Fed rate hikes.",
        "Europe faces energy price surges and tightening policies pushing its economy toward recession.",
        "In China, a surge in COVID-19 cases and inventory destocking sharply impacted corporate sales.",
        "The director supported a 0.125 percentage point rate hike.",
        "Another board director also supported raising the policy rates by 0.125 percentage points while leaving the RRR unchanged, stating that the move aligned with market expectations.",
        "The director highlighted that the annual growth rate of the monetary aggregate M2 continued to exceed 6.5%, the upper threshold of the Bank’s M2 growth reference range, and noted the widening interest rate differential between Taiwan and the US.",
        "One board director emphasized the importance of monetary policy adjustments in managing inflation expectations.",
        "Nominal earnings had risen markedly this year, exerting further pressure on inflation and potentially reflecting high inflation expectations.",
        "While higher inflation led to a contraction in real earnings, hurting household disposable income and potentially restraining consumption and investment, it is crucial to prevent inflation from accelerating.",
        "Prices for goods purchased frequently, especially staple items, had risen significantly, which heightened consumer sensitivity to price increases and fueled inflation expectations.",
        "Rising housing prices were also contributing to rent increases, impacting price stability.",
        "Furthermore, M2 growth had exceeded the Bank's reference range for 27 consecutive months, which might necessitate a review of the reference range.",
        "The director suggested communicating the Bank’s monetary policy stance to the public to demonstrate its commitment to addressing inflation.",
        "The director supported a larger rate hike of 0.25 percentage points and recommended employing alternative tools such as issuing certificates of deposits or raising policy rates for more effective interest rate transmission.",
        "Another board director pointed out that corporate pay-rise decisions were primarily influenced by employee performance and company profits rather than price trends.",
        "Domestic price increases were mainly due to supply-side shocks.",
        "However, Taiwan’s inflation was milder compared to the US and Europe, thanks to effective government supply-side measures and the spillover effects of aggressive monetary tightening by major central banks, which eased inflationary pressures in Taiwan.",
        "Regarding M2 growth, another director noted that the annual growth rate began exceeding the 6.5% threshold in August 2020, driven by the pandemic’s economic impacts and modest inflationary pressures at the time.",
        "High M2 growth was necessary to support the economy.",
        "This growth has recently moderated, with the exchange rate contributing to apparent increases due to the NT dollar depreciation.",
        "The director emphasized that M2 is a mid- to long-term indicator and suggested allowing more time before adjusting its reference range.",
        "A board director approved the 0.125 percentage point rate hike but also expressed support for a larger hike.",
        "While imported inflation concerns had subsided, potential inflationary pressures could arise from China’s reopening and consumption boom, which might increase supply chain costs and inflation.",
        "Despite the Bank’s lowered economic growth forecasts and projected decline in inflation, the Bank should monitor global supply chain developments and their impact on domestic prices.",
        "Another board director highlighted that export growth had slowed, with three consecutive months of contraction.",
        "Although economic expansion remained steady, indicators like the business climate monitor and leading indicators signaled high uncertainties.",
        "While headline inflation trended downwards, key staple goods and core inflation remained elevated, requiring close monitoring of inflation expectations.",
        "Compared to other economies, Taiwan’s inflation was mild and expected to drop below but close to 2%.",
        "The director deemed the 0.125 percentage point rate hike appropriate, considering the latest Fed rate hike of 0.5 percentage points.",
        "Another director noted that while inflation and core inflation rates were expected to drop below 2% next year, this projection was influenced by a higher base effect.",
        "Core inflation components like food away from home, rent, durable goods, meat, and apparel had experienced sustained price increases, making it difficult for core inflation to slow in the near future.",
        "Rising prices for agricultural products and energy items could further exacerbate inflation next year.",
        "Public concerns about inflationary pressures were evident from surveyed data, warranting close attention from the Bank.",
        "One board director cautioned that previous inflation forecasts by the Bank appeared overly optimistic and should be revisited.",
        "Taiwan’s milder inflation compared to other economies was largely due to government policy controls and underestimated rent costs in the CPI.",
        "Core inflation remained elevated, and slow rate hikes of 0.125 percentage points might not effectively contain inflation or mitigate inflation expectations.",
        "Historical lessons showed that insufficient monetary tightening could result in prolonged inflation and increase the risk of stagflation.",
        "Another board director remarked that the Bank’s gradual and mild approach to monetary tightening had been appropriate, given Taiwan’s relatively mild inflation.",
        "Gradual tightening helps achieve a soft economic landing, while excessive tightening risks triggering a recession and exacerbating difficulties for vulnerable populations.",
        "The proposed rate hike was based on domestic inflation readings and global economic factors.",
        "While inflationary pressures had eased recently, uncertainties surrounding inflation remain, and the Bank would adjust its monetary policy as needed.",
        "Regarding the overnight call loan rate, its role has diminished due to ample market liquidity conditions in Taiwan, unlike in the US, where the Federal Reserve uses the fed funds rate as its operational target for monetary policy.",
        "One board director noted that housing prices had surged dramatically this year, despite indications from the Bank and the industry that this reflected price-inelastic housing demand (e.g., owner-occupied housing) and rising construction costs.",
        "Even though the price index for construction works had significantly decreased since the beginning of the year, housing prices continued to rise.",
        "Bank loan portfolio concentration in real estate lending ticked down only modestly, and no new selective credit controls had been introduced since December 2021.",
        "Elevated property prices not only worsen housing affordability but also contribute to higher rental costs, driving inflation and raising concerns about financial stability.",
        "The director emphasized that high housing prices are linked to monetary policy.",
        "Research shows that Taiwan’s housing price cycle runs ahead of the credit cycle, suggesting that housing price increases are not primarily driven by bank credit growth.",
        "This could explain why the Bank’s selective credit controls have not been distinctly effective in curbing housing price gains.",
        "Speculative activities expecting price gains play a significant role in driving housing price increases.",
        "The Bank must address this issue directly and take committed efforts rather than relying solely on other authorities.",
        "Another board director pointed out that housing price trends must be assessed for their potential to cause financial instability, in line with the Bank’s mandate to safeguard financial stability.",
        "The selective credit controls aimed at mitigating the impact of housing credit on financial stability, rather than targeting housing prices directly.",
        "The director noted that property price surges were partly driven by supply-side cost increases due to labor and material shortages, as well as speculative transactions influenced by large corporate investment projects.",
        "The government’s Healthy Real Estate Market Plan, involving cross-agency efforts to address demand, supply, and institutional factors, aimed to mitigate these issues.",
        "The Bank contributed by implementing four rounds of selective credit controls, further reinforced by monetary tightening policies.",
        "Similarly, other major economies raised policy rates to combat high inflation, indirectly dampening housing prices.",
        "The director expressed hope for a soft landing in the housing market, noting that a hard landing could cause severe damage and require extensive policy measures to address, as seen in recent examples such as China’s property market crisis or Japan’s housing market crash in the late 1980s.",
        "The board directors decided to raise the discount rate, the rate on refinancing of secured loans, and the rate on temporary accommodations by 0.125 percentage points to 1.75%, 2.125%, and 4%, respectively.",
        "Since the Board last met in September, major economies have continued to tighten monetary policy, leading to significantly slower global growth.",
        "International commodity prices, including crude oil, have mostly declined, alleviating global inflationary pressures.",
        "With weakening global demand, easing supply chain bottlenecks, and declining raw material prices, global inflation is expected to moderate in the coming year.",
        "However, synchronized policy rate hikes by major central banks, including the Fed and the ECB, could further slow global growth, undermine financial stability, and heighten economic risks.",
        "Other factors, such as the US-China conflict, extreme weather events, the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, and the European energy crisis, add uncertainty to global inflation trends.",
        "Domestically, unemployment has decreased, private consumption is recovering, and the number of employed persons has edged up, thanks to diminishing pandemic impacts and lifted restrictions.",
        "However, weaker global demand and inventory destocking have led to three consecutive months of export contraction, dampening business sentiment and constraining private investment.",
        "The Bank expects economic growth to slow notably in the fourth quarter of this year and has downgraded Taiwan’s GDP growth forecast to 2.91% for the year.",
        "For 2023, loosened social restrictions and border controls may boost private consumption, but global economic slowdown and inventory overhangs are expected to weigh on export and private investment growth, moderating Taiwan’s economic expansion to 2.53%.",
        "Since mid-year, international prices of raw materials, including crude oil and grains, have softened, and domestic food prices, such as fruit and vegetables, have posted smaller gains.",
        "This has led to a downward trend in the annual growth rate of the CPI, which registered 2.35% in November.",
        "However, core CPI growth remained elevated at 2.86% in November.",
        "For the first eleven months, CPI and core CPI growth rates averaged 2.97% and 2.60%, respectively.",
        "The Bank forecasts inflation and core inflation rates for 2022 to be 2.93% and 2.59%.",
        "For 2023, as global supply chain gridlocks are resolved and raw material prices decline, the Bank projects the CPI and core CPI growth rates to drop to 1.88% and 1.87%, respectively.",
        "Banks’ excess reserves have averaged NT$60 billion in recent months.",
        "For the first ten months of the year, the annual growth rates of bank loans and investments and M2 were 7.55% and 7.54%, respectively.",
        "Monetary tightening measures have led to higher interest rates on bank deposits, loans, and money market instruments.",
        "The Board decided that a policy rate hike and continued monetary tightening will help rein in inflation expectations and promote price stability while supporting economic and financial stability.",
        "The Bank raised the discount rate, the rate on refinancing of secured loans, and the rate on temporary accommodations by 0.125 percentage points, effective December 16, 2022.",
        "Looking ahead, the Bank will closely monitor global and domestic economic and financial conditions, including monetary policy changes in major economies, raw material prices, geopolitical risks, and extreme weather events.",
        "Adjustments to monetary policy will be made as needed to maintain price and financial stability and foster economic growth.",
        "The Bank’s selective credit control measures, implemented through four amendments since December 2020, have bolstered credit risk management in the banking sector.",
        "Construction and housing loans have expanded at a slower pace, and real estate loan concentration has improved slightly.",
        "The effectiveness of these measures has been amplified by monetary tightening.",
        "Housing market transactions have decreased amid slower economic growth and government efforts under the Healthy Real Estate Market Plan.",
        "The Bank will continue to monitor housing credit and market developments and adjust measures as needed to ensure financial stability and sound banking operations.",
        "The NT dollar exchange rate remains determined by market forces.",
        "However, the Bank will intervene to maintain orderly market conditions if excessive volatility or disorderly movements arise due to factors such as massive short-term capital flows, which could adversely affect economic and financial stability.",
        "At the beginning of the year (2022), the global economic recovery continued, and \nsupply  chain  bottlenecks  slightly  eased  but  remained  unresolved.",
        "Then,  the  Russian \ninvasion  of  Ukraine  in  late  February  prompted  major  economies  to  impose  sanctions \nagainst Russia, disrupting global economic activity, stoking the prices of energy, metal, \nand grains, and riling financial markets.",
        "For the  outlook of this  year,  the Russia-Ukraine  war,  surging  commodity prices, \npersistent supply chain bottlenecks, and the tapering of fiscal and monetary stimuli could \nall  weigh  on  the  global  economy.",
        "In  this  view,  international  institutions  recently \ndowngraded their forecasts for the 2022 global economic growth.",
        "Global  trade  was  also  forecasted  by  international  institutions  to  grow  slower  in \n2022 than in 2021 as the WTO Goods Trade Barometer slid deeper this year so far.",
        "The \nrecent Russia-Ukraine conflict and the ensuing sanctions on Russia risk further \ndisrupting global trade growth.",
        "For the year to date, oil prices soared on geopolitical tensions in the Middle East \nand the Russian invasion of Ukraine.",
        "More recently, though, possible demand slowdown \nfrom a COVID-19 flare-up in China and the Russia-Ukraine peace talks sent oil prices \nlower.",
        "For the year as a whole, international institutions projected oil prices to be higher \nthan the previous  year.",
        "Grain and metal prices also rose markedly as the Ukraine war \nand  the  sanctions  on  Russia  hampered  the  supply  and  exportation  of  grains  and  base \nmetals.",
        "Unabated  supply-demand  imbalance  owing  to  supply  chain  bottlenecks  and  the \nUkraine  war-induced  price  surges  amid  disrupted  supply  and  exportation  of  raw \nmaterials exerted heavy pressures on global inflation, leading international institutions \nto revise this year’s global inflation forecasts upwards.",
        "Since the Board last met in  December 2021, the U.S. Federal  Reserve (Fed) and \nthe Bank of England had announced rate hikes, the European Central Bank (ECB) was \nlikely to end its bond buying program in the third quarter of the 2022, while Japan’s and \nChina’s central banks maintained a broadly loose monetary policy stance.",
        "In the recent month, the 10-year government bond yields of the U.S. and Germany \nboth  rebounded  as  investors  expected  the  Fed  and  the  ECB  to  exit  monetary  easing.",
        "Global stock markets fluctuated downwards from a previous high after the Fed signaled \na policy tightening.",
        "Then, stock markets took another hit as Russia invaded Ukraine in \nlate February and faced a growing array of sanctions from major countries.",
        "In the foreign \nexchange market, the US dollar index trended up as investors expecting a faster rate hike \ncycle  of  the  Fed  turned  to  US  dollar  assets.",
        "Then,  intensifying  conflicts  in  Ukraine \npushed up hedging demand and led the US dollar index to rise sharply and fluctuate at \nelevated levels.",
        "Looking  ahead,  the  global  economy  is  confronted  by  multiple  downside  risks, \nincluding:  (1)  risks  from  geopolitical  and  military  conflicts  could  escalate  and  impair \nglobal  economic  activity;  (2)  soaring  raw  material  prices  and  tight  labor  market \nconditions could cause inflation to stay high; (3) the pace of major economies’ monetary \npolicy normalization could be interrupted or disrupted, and financial market volatility \ncould  heighten;  (4)  new  coronavirus  variants  could  harm  health  and  climate  change \ncould cause a global food crisis.",
        "These risks, should they materialize, will hinder global \neconomic growth and jeopardize financial stability.",
        "The  easing  of  the  domestic  pandemic-related  restrictions  and  continued  export \nstrength gave a further boost to economic activity, and firms were optimistic about the \noutlook in the coming six months.",
        "In  terms  of  external  demand,  emerging  technology  application  and  traditional \nmanufacture continued enjoying strong demand, leading exports of major products and \nexports  to  major  trading  partners  to  expand  by  more  than  10%  for  the  year  to  date.",
        "Looking ahead, the Bank expected Taiwan’s export to register solid growth this  year, benefiting  from  growing  business  opportunities  of  products  for  digital  transformation \nand emerging technology application, as well as firms increasing production capacity.",
        "With respect to internal demand, private investment was expected to sustain growth \nwith  tech  firms  increasing  capital  outlay,  major  investment  projects  –  such  as  green \nenergy  and  government-supported  infrastructure  development  –  moving  along,  and \nmaritime and air transporters procuring new equipment.",
        "Private consumption was also \nexpected to pick up against a backdrop of stable COVID-19 situation at home, and other \nfavorable  factors  including  pay  rises  for  public  sector  employees  and  base  wage  hike \nand improved prospects for listed companies to pay dividends thanks to healthy profits \nthe previous year.",
        "Since the second half of 2021, labor market conditions had gradually returned to \nthe  level  before  the  May  2021  domestic  COVID-19  flare-up;  as  the  outbreak  was \ncontained  and  economic  activity  rebounded,  the  unemployment  rate  continued  to  fall \nand employment kept rising month by month.",
        "The nominal average regular earnings of \nall  non-farm  employees  increased  moderately.",
        "In  particular,  the  harder-hit  services \nsector saw a gradual rebound in wages and this sector’s real GDP also resumed growth \nthanks  to  improved  domestic  pandemic  situation.",
        "These  developments  showed  that \nrecoveries across various sectors have become less uneven.",
        "Overall,  sustained  growth  in  exports  and  private  investment  and  reinvigorating \nprivate consumption were likely to help uphold stable economic growth momentum for \nthe  year  despite  a  higher  base  effect  and  potential  impact  from  the  Ukraine  war.",
        "The \nBank projected Taiwan’s economy to expand by 4.05% this year, while the growth \nprojections by major institutions ranged between 3.11% and 4.42%.",
        "From February onwards, though financial markets were disturbed by the Russian \ninvasion  of  Ukraine,  market  liquidity  remained  ample  and  short  term  market  rates \nfluctuated within a tight range.",
        "Looking at domestic credit and money conditions, in January, government demand \nfor funds increased owing to public sector pay raise, payment for year-end bonuses, and pandemic  relief  and  subsidies,  along  with  a  typical  rise  in  corporate  funding  demand \nahead of the Chinese New Year holidays.",
        "As a result, the annual growth rate of domestic \nbanks’ loans and investments rose, with loans to small and medium-sized  enterprises \n(SMEs) also expanding.",
        "In terms of the annual growth rate of the monetary aggregate \nM2, though hovering above the 6.5% upper limit of the  Bank’s reference range since \nAugust 2020, it began trending downwards from September 2021 on.",

        "With a view to preserving financial stability and reinforcing credit risk \nmanagement associated with real estate lending, the Bank implemented and adjusted the \nselective credit control measures with four amendments since December 2020, seeking \nto prevent credit resources from flooding the real estate market.",
        "These measures have \nproved effective in mitigating related bank credit risk as the regulated types of real estate \nloans had been granted in compliance with relevant rules and the loan-to-value (LTV) \nratios thereof were significantly lower than before.",
        "According to Article 72-2 of the Banking Act, the total amount of loans extended for residential construction \nand construction for business purposes by a Commercial Bank shall not exceed thirty percent (30%) of the \naggregate of such Commercial Bank's deposits and Bank Debentures issued at the time such loans is extended.",
        "With a year-to-date global price rally for crude oil and other raw materials and a \ndomestic  price  hike  in  some  food  and  beverage  products,  home  appliances,  and \nautomobiles, the annual CPI growth rate was still elevated, exceeding 2% for the seventh \nstraight month.",
        "For the first two months of the year, the annual CPI growth rate averaged 2.60%, \nreflecting price rises in fuel and lubricant products, food away from home, fruit, durable \nconsumer  goods,  and  transportation  with  a  combined  contribution  of  1.57  percentage \npoints to the increase.",
        "As  consumers  tend  to  be  more  sensitive  about  price  changes  in  goods  they \nfrequently  purchase,  the  recent  price  hike  in  some  staple  goods  as  well  as  food  and \nbeverages  amplified  consumer  sentiment  of  rising  prices.",
        "The  Bank’s  survey  for \ninflation  expectations  found  that,  compared  to  the  previous  quarter,  a  larger  share  of \nrespondents  in  the  corporate  sector  and  in  investment  trust  companies  expected  the \nannual CPI growth rate to exceed 2%, mainly because of international raw material price \nrises and domestic price hikes by some firms.",
        "The  global  supply  chain  bottleneck  could  persist,  and  the  Ukraine  war-induced \ndisruptions have pushed up commodity prices such as crude oil, grains, and base metals.",
        "This  would  further  feed  into  domestic  prices  of  energy,  food,  and  durable  consumer \ngoods, adding to inflationary pressures.",
        "The Bank expected inflation to still run above \n2% in the first three quarters this year before sliding below 2% in the fourth quarter.",

        "Looking  ahead,  the  following  factors  could  create  upside  price  pressures  for \nTaiwan: (1) persistent supply chain imbalance and the Russia-Ukraine war significantly \ndriving  global  freight  rates  and  commodity  (such  as  crude  oil  and  grains)  prices \nupwards; (2) a proposed hike in the national health insurance copayment fees feeding \ninto  the  prices  of  healthcare-related  items.",
        "On  the  other  hand,  sources  of  downside \npressures included (1) declines in communication devices prices and communications \nrates; (2) the government’s potential reduction of tax rates for commodity tax, customs \nduty, and business tax, helping to mitigate rising cost pressures for firms.",

        "Board  members  reached  a  unanimous  vote  to  raise  the  discount  rate,  the  rate  on \nrefinancing of secured loans, and the rate on temporary accommodations by 25 basis \npoints to 1.375%, 1.75%, and 3.625%, respectively.",
        "Related discussions are \nsummarized as follows.",
        "(1) Discussion on the policy rate proposition \nOne board director noted that the domestic economic growth was relatively stable \nand  the  economy  was  projected  to  expand  at  a  pace  faster  than  4%.",
        "The  annual  CPI \ngrowth rate had been above 2% for several consecutive months and would likely stay \naround that level.",
        "Meanwhile, given the US Fed’s rate hike decision,  the  fact  that \ndomestic  interest  rates  had  been  held  at  a  relatively  low  level  for  some  time  could \nhamper  effective  capital  allocation.",
        "Therefore,  raising  the  policy  rates  would  be  an \nappropriate move.",
        "In addition, it was expected that a rate hike would have a dampening \neffect on housing price surges.",
        "One  board  director  pointed  out  that  for  a  small  open  economy  like  Taiwan,  it  is \ndifficult and unsound for monetary policy to proceed without regard to the moves and \nstances of major central banks, and monetary policy conduct in line with those in major \neconomies would be more effective.",
        "Meanwhile, the domestic economy fared well, with \nthe  2021  economic  growth  rate  much  higher  than  expected  and  the  2022  economy \nprojected to enjoy solid growth.",
        "For several months in a row, the CPI inflation rate had \nexceeded  2%  and  the  annual  M2  growth  rate  had  overshot  the  upper  limit  of  the \nreference range amid accommodative liquidity conditions.",
        "Therefore, the board director \nsupported the 25 basis points (bps) rate hike proposition and noted that the current focus \nfor the Bank is not fostering economic growth but addressing the issues of inflation and \nbubbling asset prices.",
        "One board director expressed support for the 25 bps rate hike based on assessments \ntaking  into  account  of  cross-border  capital  movements  and  domestic  price  trends.",
        "However, this director noted that higher rates would add to the interest payment burdens \non young people taking out their first housing loans or trading up for bigger homes, a \npotential situation that requires attention and could be taken into account in future policy \ndiscussions regarding selective credit controls.",
        "One board director stated that Taiwan’s economy showed good growth in the last \nthree  years,  whereas  imported  inflationary  pressures  caused  the  CPI  inflation  rate  to \nhover above 2% for several months.",
        "The director viewed that the effect of a 25 bps hike \nwas less about dampening housing prices than about sending a message.",
        "Furthermore, \ndespite  some  results  from  the  four  rounds  of  selective  credit  controls,  housing  price \nexpectations seemed to be buoyed up by repeated record highs in the past year.",
        "Given \nthe current economic and financial situation, the director supported a 25 bps rate hike \nand  suggested  to  continue  monitoring  the  Fed’s  rate  path,  global  economic \ndevelopments, and domestic price trends while prudently formulating monetary policy.",
        "One board director gave the following reasons in favor of a 25 bps rate hike.",
        "First, \nthe Fed had begun a rate hike cycle.",
        "Though inflation in Taiwan was not as concerning \nas  in  the  U.S.,  the  unemployment  rate  already  dropped  to  close  to  the  natural  rate  of \nunemployment,  a  sign  that  the  economy  might  be  heating  up;  a  25  bps  rate  increase \nwould help dampen the heat.",
        "Second, protracted low interest rates in recent years had \nalso helped shore up asset prices in Taiwan; combined with rising inflation expectations \nand the idea of buying real estate as an inflation hedge, housing prices could go further \nup.",
        "Raising the policy rates by 25 basis points could not only send an inflation-fighting \nmessage but also rein in the asset price buildup, making it an appropriate policy move.",
        "One board director pointed out that though Taiwan’s inflation was below 3% and \nlower than major economies, inflationary pressures would actually be higher than what \nthe  data  showed.",
        "In  addition,  more  after-effects  of  the  Ukraine  war  could  arise; \nparticularly,  energy  market  shifts  and  supply  chain  shocks  could  result  in  lasting \noutcomes and effects.",
        "Housing prices rose  quite sharply in the fourth quarter of 2021 \nand it seemed that higher price expectations had become entrenched since more than a \nyear  ago,  a  sentiment  difficult  to  dissolve.",
        "With  interest  rates  staying  low  for  a  long \nwhile,  speculators  seeking  short-term  gains  and  first-time  homebuyers  wary  of  price \nsurges scrambled to buy houses, creating a vicious loop that could be exacerbated if low \nrates persist longer.",
        "One  board  director  stated  that  the  forecasting  model  designed  to  gauge  the \nprobability of recession in Taiwan showed a very slim likelihood.",
        "In addition, inflation \nwas expected to remain above 2%, economic growth was strong and employment was \nsolid.",
        "In  this  view,  this  would  be  the  right  timing  for  monetary  policy  normalization.",
        "The  director  therefore  supported  the  proposition  to  raise  the  policy  rates  by  25  basis \npoints.",
        "The Bank would need to closely monitor the developments of inflation \nexpectation and continue conducting inflation expectation surveys.",
        "One board director noted that the rate hike proposition was partly based on current \neconomic  strength,  solid  labor  market  recovery,  and  pressures  from  inflation.",
        "In \naddition,  keeping  inflation  in  check  would  likely  boost  slow-growing  real  wages.",
        "Inflation  affects  households  of  various  income  brackets  in  different  ways.",
        "With  the \nprices  of  items  to  buy  at  least  once  a  month  and  the  17  major  staples  (on  the \ngovernment’s monitor list for price stabilization) rising more markedly than the overall \nCPI  growth,  the  public  tended  to  be  more  acutely  aware  of  price  hikes  and  to  expect \nhigher  prices  in  the  future  too.",
        "Raising  the  policy  rates  would  help  dampen  inflation \nexpectation  while  also  rein  in  expectation  of  higher  housing  prices.",
        "Moreover,  in  the \npost-Board Meeting press conference in December 2021, the Bank already floated the \npossibility of a future rate hike so as to promote public understanding of monetary policy \nand to guide public expectation of the policy path in the right direction,  in hopes that \nborrowers  including  homebuyers  would  be  prepared  for  future  interest  payments.",
        "Importantly, from the perspective of financial stability, the press conference \ncommunication also demonstrated central bank transparency and would be essential to \nanchoring inflation and stabilizing real estate prices.",
        "Another  board  director  expressed  support  for  the  rate  hike  mainly  because  the \nreasons for the Bank’s rate cut two years ago no longer existed; and while the recoveries \namong  sectors  were  uneven  –  slow  in  the  services  sector  but  strong  in  the  industrial \nsector, the situation was beyond the Bank’s capabilities and capacity.",
        "With this rate hike, \nthe  policy  rates  would  return  to  the  level  before  the  last  rate  cut,  which  would  be  an \nappropriate move.",
        "One  board  director  stated  that  even  though  it  seemed  to  be  the  timing  for  a  rate \nhike, it would be preferable to wait until the next Board meeting in June or to hike the \nrates now but by 12.5 basis points instead.",
        "This was based on three reasons.",
        "First, the \nNT dollar had not turned weak.",
        "Second, until the Bank’s special accommodation facility \nto  support  SMEs  concludes  on  June  30,  2022,  this  would  still  be  a  time  when  relief \nmeasures are judged needed to stay in place while many industries remain financially \nstressed; a rate hike at this juncture would add to funding pressures.",
        "Third, the around \n2% headline and core inflation rates at present were primarily caused by labor shortages \nand raw material supply logjams, both exerting great influence on inflation.",
        "Another board director was also in favor of a rate hike, albeit with concern about \nthe pace of  25 basis points.",
        "A rate hike would be appropriate  given that the domestic inflation  rate  had  been  over  2%  for  several  months  in  a  row,  that  inflation  pressures \ncould continue rising with the Ukraine war pushing up prices of metal, energy, and farm \nproduce,  and  that  inflation  expectations  of  investment  trust  companies  and  of  the \ncorporate sector tilted to the upside.",
        "The normalization move would also be warranted \nby  the  fact  that  interest  rates  had  stayed  low  for  a  long  while.",
        "Moreover,  positive \nreadings from data on exports, investment, and consumption indicated that a rate hike \nwould  not  create  much  of  a  concern.",
        "Nevertheless, the Bank’s rate hike would then \ntranslate into higher interest burdens on borrowers of various types of the government’s \npolicy loan programs; it would thus be important to reconsider whether a 12.5 or 25 bps \nrate hike is more appropriate.",
        "One board director supported raising the policy rates and remarked that a rate hike, \neither by  25 basis points or by 12.5 basis points, would have an announcement effect \nnonetheless.",
        "The effect not only could guide public expectation and recognition of the \nBank’s resolve to contain  inflation  but  also  would  help  facilitate  a  healthy  housing \nmarket.",
        "Discussion on the Bank’s special accommodation facility to support SMEs   \nOne board director pointed out the fact that the Bank’s special accommodation \nfacility to  support SMEs (hereinafter  “the facility”) was introduced in March 2020 in \ntandem  with  a  25  bps  rate  reduction;  accordingly,  a  25  bps  rate  hike  in  this  Meeting \nshould lead to a simultaneous increase in the rate on the facility’s special \naccommodations to banks.",
        "However, the facility was scheduled to end on June 30, 2022; \nconsidering the imminence of the expiry date, the Bank would amend relevant rules to \nkeep the rate on the facility’s special accommodations to banks at 0.1% through to June \n30, 2022, so that banks’ loans to SMEs could continue using preferential rates.",
        "Several \nboard directors supported this proposition.",
        "Another board director noted that many pandemic-hit SMEs were still not out of \nthe woods, while the Bank’s facility was in effect closing down as the June 30, 2022 \nexpiry date is not so far from mid-March.",
        "Considering the likelihood that SMEs might \nstill need funding support after the facility expires, the Board could give deeper thought \nto  the  impact  on  SME  funding  costs  if  the  policy  rates  were  to  be  raised  by  25  basis points.",
        "One board director took note of the public’s interest in whether the facility will be \nextended beyond June 30, 2022, and expressed the view that, with the domestic COVID-\n19  outbreaks  easing,  the  number  and  amount  of  SME  loan  cases  guaranteed  by  the \ngovernment (i.e., Small and Medium Enterprise Credit Guarantee Fund of Taiwan) and \ngranted by banks  under the facility had been  rather  modest since the end of February \n2022, indicating the Bank had fulfilled its interim mission.",
        "When the facility ends, the \nBank would urge banks to keep credit flowing to the SMEs as needed.",
        "(3) Discussion on the Bank’s selective credit control measures \nOne board director pointed out that the latest data showed both existing and newly-\nbuilt  homes  recorded  large  price  gains  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2021  that  accelerated \nsignificantly from the previous quarter, with Hsinchu City and Hsinchu County leading \nthe surge.",
        "In regard to lending, the recent slight decline in the annual growth rate of real \nestate loans was partly due to a higher base effect, instead of being a clear sign of the \nuptrend reversing.",
        "Meanwhile, real estate loans continued to take up a rising share in \ntotal loans.",
        "In addition, compared with recent data of other economies, Taiwan’s real \nhousing  price  index  seemed  to  have  a  relatively  lower  annual  growth  rate;  however, \nTaiwan ranked higher than most countries in terms of accumulated growth in housing \nprices in the past 20 years.",
        "In this light, more discussion seemed imperative on the issue \nof imposing selective credit controls.",
        "One board director took note of the elevated annual growth rate of housing prices \nat present and suggested the Bank pay close attention and, if necessary, further reinforce \nthe  selective  credit  control  measures.",
        "Another  board  director  also  remarked  that \nconsumers  conscious  of  surging  housing  prices  in  major  cities  and  cautious  against \nrising inflation were planning to buy real estate as an inflation hedge.",
        "This called for the \nBank’s close attention and, if necessary, might require a new round of selective credit \ncontrols on the real estate market.",
        "One board director pointed to the relatively focused and limited scope of the Bank’s \nselective  credit  controls  and suggested the possibility of broadening the measures’ \ninfluence to a wider range in the future.",
        "On the other hand, the director stated that back \nin  2010,  housing  prices  had  not  been  significantly  dented  by  the  Bank’s  macro-\nprudential  measures  imposed  on  housing  loans  in  the  designated  “specific  areas”  in \nTaipei City, New Taipei City, and Taoyuan; the housing market slump actually set in \nlater  in  2016  after  the  introduction  of  the  consolidated  land  and  housing  sales  tax,  as \nwell  as  an  economic  slowdown  and  a  stock  market  decline.",
        "Therefore,  it  seemed \nuncertain whether housing prices would be brought down even if the current selective \ncredit controls were to be enhanced for another around in the future.",
        "Monetary Policy Decision: The board directors reached a unanimous vote to raise \nthe discount rate, the rate on refinancing of secured loans, and the rate on temporary \naccommodations by 25 basis points to 1.375%, 1.75%, and 3.625%, respectively.",
        "The board directors and supervisors approved unanimously to issue the following \npress  release  in  the  post-meeting  press  conference,  together  with  the  Supplementary \nMaterials for the Post-Monetary Policy Meeting Press Conference prepared by the Bank.",
        "Since  the  Board  met  in  December  last  year,  the  global  economic  recovery  has \nremained  on  track  amid  an  Omicron-driven  pandemic  resurgence  and  lingering \nsupply  chain  bottlenecks.",
        "The  recent  Russian  invasion  of  Ukraine  has  propelled \nmajor economies to impose economic and financial sanctions on Russia, hampering \nglobal commodity supply, inducing commodity price surges, and thereby creating \nfurther inflationary pressures.",
        "In addition, as the US Fed and other central banks in \nmajor  economies  began  to  reduce  monetary  policy  accommodation,  the  global \neconomy this year is expected to grow at a slower pace.",
        "Owing to the impacts of the \nRussia-Ukraine conflict and the ensuing sanctions, international financial  markets \nexperienced  greater  volatility.",
        "International  institutions  trimmed  down  the  global \neconomic growth forecast for this  year and revised up their projections for global \ninflation.",
        "Looking  ahead,  risks  such  as  geopolitical  tensions,  surging  international  raw \nmaterial  prices,  recurring  outbreaks  caused  by  new  coronavirus  variants,  and \naggravating threat from climate change could contribute to more persistently high \nglobal  inflation,  negative  impacts  on  economic  activity,  and  heightened  financial \nmarket volatility, posing greater downside risks to the global economy.",
        "Domestic economic and financial conditions \n1.",
        "From  the  beginning  of  2022,  despite  Omicron-driven  disruptions  to  the  domestic \neconomy, consumers largely remained willing to spend, and the retail and \nfood/beverage  sectors  registered  growing  sales.",
        "In  addition,  bolstered  by  thriving \nglobal  economic  activity,  solid  demand  for  emerging  technology  applications  and \ndigital  transformation-related  products,  growth  momentum  for  exports  remained \nstrong  and  capital  equipment  imports  continued  to  increase,  leading  to  a  robust \nexpansion in the domestic economy.",
        "Going forward, private consumption growth is \nlikely to gather pace, and exports and private investment will continue picking up.",

        "For the first two months of 2022, the consumer price index (CPI) posted an average \nannual growth rate of 2.60%, a still fast pace mainly because of domestic fuel price \nhikes  following  international  oil  rallies  and  cost-pushed  price  increases  for  food \naway  from  home,  as  well  as  rising  prices  for  fruit,  durable  consumer  goods,  and flight  tickets.",

        "For the domestic inflation outlook, however, \nthe recent Russia-Ukraine conflict and the consequent price surges in global energy \nitems and other commodities impose considerable imported inflation pressures.",
        "The \nannual growth rate  of the CPI has stayed over  2% for consecutive  months and will \nlikely remain so towards the third quarter of the year, while that of the core CPI has \nalso increased, both pointing to a persistent trend of elevated inflation.",
        "Furthermore, \nthe domestically-oriented services sector that took a greater hit from the pandemic has \ngradually  rebounded  and  the  labor  market  conditions  have  continued  to  improve.",

        "The government took measures to stabilize oil and electricity rates and reduced several customs duties, commodity taxes, and business taxes where necessary.",

        "In the face of drastic price volatility caused by supply-side factors, monetary policy responses such as aggressive tightening could concomitantly restrain economic output; therefore, supply-side measures would serve better under the circumstances.",
        "However, as inflation was expected to stay elevated for an extended period of time, an appropriate tightening stance would still be needed to help anchor inflation expectations and reach a better supply-demand balance, so as to maintain price stability.",
        "The Bank raised the policy rates by 25 basis points in March this year, a decision based on the anticipation that the domestically-oriented services sector was on track towards continued revival and thus the policy rates could be brought back up to the pre-pandemic level.",

        "In light of elevated domestic inflation, a larger policy rate increase would more significantly exacerbate interest burdens of economically-vulnerable businesses and workers taking out relief loans and other policy loans; it would be more appropriate to adopt a more moderate pace for today’s rate hike.",
        "In light of the ongoing price uptrends at home, the Bank proposed to simultaneously raise policy rates and reserve requirement ratios to rein in public expectations for price growth.",
        "The Bank judged that adopting a monetary policy mix to affect price (interest rates) and quantity (money stock) would not only help amplify policy effects but also clearly demonstrate the Bank’s stance to continue tightening.",
        "Higher policy rates tend to affect not just one particular part but a broad range of the economy, including the deposit rates of financial institutions which current relief loans or other policy loans are typically linked to.",
        "Therefore, it would be more appropriate to refrain from unwarranted large rate increases.",
        "On the other hand, since higher reserve requirement ratios do not directly affect deposit rates, using this tool as part of the policy mix would therefore not add to the interest burden of vulnerable workers and firms.",
        "With the increase of reserve requirement ratios, banks would shift their funds from central bank-issued certificates of deposit or redeposits to required reserves, so that bank capital would park with the central bank for a longer period.",
        "This would reduce the stock of money in the economy, thereby alleviating inflationary pressures and helping maintain price stability.",
        "As banks will have to set aside more funds to be held as reserves, they would be more cautious in making new investments and extending new credit.",
        "This would constrain the capacity of credit creation by banks and, in turn, help maintain M2 growth at an appropriate level.",
        "The Bank proposed to raise the discount rate, the rate on refinancing of secured loans, and the rate on temporary accommodations by 12.5 basis points to 1.5%, 1.875%, and 3.75%, respectively, and to increase the reserve requirement ratios on NT dollar demand deposits and time (savings) deposits by 25 basis points.",
        "The Board members reached a unanimous vote to raise the policy rates by 12.5 basis points and to increase the reserve requirement ratios on NT dollar demand deposits and time (savings) deposits by 25 basis points.",
        "One board director stated that this year’s price rises were mainly due to imported inflation, and supply-side inflationary pressures were beyond the influence of monetary policy.",
        "Nevertheless, considering that price stability is part of the Bank’s statutory mandate, it would be imperative to adopt an appropriate increase in the policy rates to rein in inflation.",
        "Meanwhile, data showed that since the Bank’s March rate hike, the average excess reserves of financial institutions had come to levels higher than the same period last year.",
        "Therefore, raising the reserve requirement ratios by an appropriate extent would reduce the money stock and restrain bank credit expansion, thereby making up a tightening move that affects both quantity (money stock) and price (interest rates).",
        "Furthermore, in deciding the pace of the policy rate hike, one should also take into account the recent local COVID-19 resurgence’s impact on the SMEs.",
        "Therefore, the board director was in favor of a 12.5 basis-point rate hike and a 25 basis-point increase in the reserve requirement ratios.",
        "Another board director agreed with today’s propositions and stated that the considerations supporting the policy rate increase by only 12.5 basis points—including financial conditions having tightened, economic activity likely slackening off, relief loan programs closing (leaving the respective loan rates at the discretion of banks), and domestic demand recovery sputtering (e.g., domestically-oriented services sector posting negative real earnings growth)—were understandable.",
        "However, one of the main objectives of interest rate tools is to anchor inflation expectations; the Bank should communicate to the public that today’s decisions took into consideration the impact of evolving price trends and therefore it opted for an approach that would affect both money stock and interest rates.",
        "Such communication would promote policy effectiveness by improving public understanding of potential changes in inflation expectations and borrowing costs over the coming months or an extended time.",
        "One board director pointed out that although domestic inflation had been trending up owing to rising international oil prices, the government had introduced many supply-side measures, including a domestic oil price stabilizing mechanism and electricity rate freezes, to mitigate such supply-side inflation.",
        "Meanwhile, the Bank’s policy rate hike would also help temper inflation expectations, albeit with possible negative implications, especially for the domestically-oriented services sector.",
        "One board director noted that the services sector was battered by the pandemic and was having a hard time regaining its footing.",
        "With the Bank’s Special Accommodation Facility set to close soon, a further 25 basis-point rate hike would weigh on the services sector as well as the SMEs.",
        "In this view, it would help to tap an alternative solution by using the reserve requirement tool in tandem.",
        "The director, expressing support for today’s policy propositions, added that the reserve requirement tool influences through the stock of money.",
        "While it has been a while since the tool was last deployed, the increase in the reserve requirement ratios in today’s meeting would affect money supply through the money multiplier effect, the positive and negative outcomes of which should be rigorously followed to help guide future policy formulation.",
        "Another board director, approving of today’s policy propositions, noted that although the broad, ongoing price rises chiefly resulted from supply-side factors, the central bank should still take actions where needed.",
        "The director also pointed out that the downward revision to the Bank’s domestic GDP forecast primarily reflected below-expectation progress in private consumption.",
        "The rate hike, albeit based on a comprehensive assessment of the overall economic and financial conditions, would be helpful to some parts of the economy while undesirable to others.",
        "The Bank’s monetary tightening was aimed at combating inflation.",
        "The key would be to bring down inflation expectations of the household and corporate sectors, preventing such mentality from becoming entrenched and thus causing prices to spiral upwards.",
        "Since today’s increase in policy rates was smaller than the March rate hike and the reserve requirement tool functions indirectly via the bank credit channel, adequate communication to the public about the inflation-fighting effects of today’s decisions would be important for the policy to work well in containing inflation expectations.",
        "One board director agreed with a 25 basis-point rise in the reserve requirement ratios and, while supporting a policy rate hike, recognized the challenge in deciding on a rate hike by either 12.5 or 25 basis points.",
        "After the Bank raised the policy rates by 25 basis points in March, data showed that the overnight call loan rate and other short-term interest rates did not increase by a corresponding extent, implying that the March rate decision somehow did not go far beyond an announcement effect.",
        "Therefore, a further hike by 25 basis points would be more appropriate in today’s meeting, whereas a 12.5 basis-point hike, if adopted, should be accompanied by a 12.5 basis-point hike in the interest rates on 7-day (or other short-term) certificates of deposit issued by the Bank.",
        "One board director pointed out that Taiwan’s inflationary pressures were in fact much higher than what the actual data showed.",
        "Be it supply-side or demand-side, inflation of either type would certainly affect inflation expectations, an area where the Bank should tackle.",
        "Historically, regardless of the type of inflation, an easy money environment seems to have been the underlying cause of rising inflation.",
        "The clearer, the firmer, and the sooner an effective monetary policy is introduced, the more likely it will be to well anchor inflation expectations early on and to ward off the risk of an economic recession.",
        "Though monetary policy is not a cure-all, its timely effective deployment would help treat the problems.",
        "Slow and conservative rate hikes might not be powerful enough to constrain inflation and anchor inflation expectations.",
        "Meanwhile, despite four amendments to the selective credit controls on housing credit, each round was implemented with a light touch and may not be effective.",
        "Indeed, some of the relevant indicators – such as housing prices, housing loan portfolio concentration, the household debt-to-GDP ratio, housing prices-to-income ratio, and the housing loan burden ratio – had continued to hit record highs.",
        "This director expressed concern that the Board did not take action against the housing price issue in the March meeting, neither did it in today’s meeting.",
        "In addition, although a policy mix has the benefit of amplifying the intended effect, the one proposed in today’s meeting still appeared to err on the side of caution.",
        "Compared to the monetary policy conduct of central banks the world over, the extent of a 12.5 basis-point increase seemed to be out of norm and lack potency.",
        "One board director noted that Taiwan’s inflation had been mild so far this year compared to other economies; though inflation expectations had risen, the inflation rate was expected to gradually trend down in the second half of the year.",
        "Against this backdrop, it was warranted to raise the policy rates to stem higher inflation, but the pace should not be rushed in order not to adversely impact vulnerable sectors, such as the domestically-oriented services sector, in which a growing number of employees were furloughed amid the impact from the recent Omicron outbreak.",
        "Meanwhile, as domestic banks’ excess reserves stood at high levels, raising the reserve requirement ratios would help restrain the liquidity of money supply.",
        "In all, the director agreed with today’s propositions.",
        "Another board director also expressed support for the policy propositions, stating that the simultaneous tightening through price (interest rates) and quantity (money stock) would not only demonstrate the Bank’s resolve to keep inflation in check but also show the market that the Bank is keeping an eye on the overnight call loan rate, an indicator of short-term funding costs.",
        "Nevertheless, the reserve requirement adjustment has not been frequently deployed, and the effect of such policy implementation on bank excess reserves and market interest rates would need to be closely monitored.",
        "Moreover, with a policy rate hike, financially vulnerable borrowers would feel the pain of a heavier interest burden when banks correspondingly raise their interest rates on loans (as well as on deposits); on the other hand, larger corporates would be better equipped to sustain a rate hike as their funding costs via debt issuance are largely determined by bills finance and capital market interest rates.",
        "In this view, today’s proposition to administer a smaller rate hike, along with raising the reserve requirements, would be an equitable approach that looks out for the economically disadvantaged people.",
        "One board director pointed out that in the past three years, unanticipated shocks including the US-China trade conflicts, the coronavirus outbreak, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine had resulted in volatile price uptrends internationally and domestically, leading foreign and local institutions to keep upgrading inflation projections.",
        "In the US, inflation was spurred by both supply and demand factors, prompting the Fed to combat inflation with aggressive rate hikes.",
        "On the other hand, Taiwan’s inflation was mainly induced by supply constraints; with domestic consumer demand still lukewarm and the government adopting supply-side measures to stabilize prices, inflation remained mild compared to major economies, thus warranting a more moderate pace of rate hikes.",
        "Nonetheless, if inflation becomes persistently high, then monetary tightening should step up.",
        "In regard to housing market-related measures, the Bank’s four recent rounds of selective credit controls were in fact financial stability measures introduced to avoid an inordinate credit flow into the real estate sector, instead of attempts aiming directly at housing prices.",
        "Therefore, the effectiveness of such measures would be better reflected by financial stability-related indicators such as portfolio concentration and non-performing loan ratios of real estate lending.",
        "Currently, banks had shown good real estate credit management, housing transactions had slowed somewhat, and the policy efforts by other government agencies to ensure a sound housing market were expected to gradually make headway.",
        "In addition, monetary tightening since March would also help dampen housing credit growth.",
        "Based on such an assessment, it was judged appropriate to maintain the selective credit controls at the current status.",
        "In the future, the Bank should continue monitoring developments related to real estate lending and, if necessary, take further measures in a timely manner.",
        "One board director expressed concern because the proposition’s 12.5 basis points would trail farther behind the Fed’s rate hikes which included a 75 basis-point rise in June and another hike expected in July.",
        "Despite the fact that recent NTD weakness was mainly caused by foreign portfolio investment outflows, more downward pressures on the currency could ensue if a wider US-Taiwan interest rate differential induces more capital outflows.",
        "Since Taiwan’s price uptrends were due in large part to rises in import prices of raw materials, a weaker currency would also weigh on price stability.",
        "In addition, the relatively mild inflation in Taiwan was mainly supported by utility (oil, electricity, natural gas, etc.)",
        "fee freezes and subsidies from the government.",
        "Recent data pointed to little change in domestic economic and financial conditions; combined with the Fed’s aggressive rate hikes, it would seem more fitting for the Bank to raise the policy rates by 25 basis points.",
        "On the other hand, the last time the Bank adjusted reserve requirements was more than a decade ago, and the effect of this type of adjustment at a time when bank excess reserves stayed somewhat elevated would be limited.",
        "One board director approved of a 12.5 basis-point rate hike, noting that an appropriate hike would help rein in inflation expectations.",
        "However, given this was a small increase by 12.5 basis points, it would be important to heed potential impacts of a wider US-Taiwan interest rate differential on capital flows and NT dollar exchange rates.",
        "As Taiwan faced mainly price pressures arising from imported inflation, the widening differential would possibly induce capital outflows and further weaken the NTD, aggravating the problem of imported inflation.",
        "One board director stated that the US government bond yields have surged as the Fed tightened at a faster pace; this not only weakened the US economic outlook and weighed on future stock dividend growth, but also pushed up the discount rate (used in business valuation that converts future returns into present value) and led investors to downgrade stock valuations, causing sharp corrections in the US stock markets.",
        "Reflecting the US financial market turbulence, Taiwan’s stock indices also fluctuated downwards, triggering a sell-off by foreign institutional investors who, based on asset re-allocation and funds redemption strategies, executed large profit-taking trades and moved capital out, causing the NT dollar to weaken more markedly than usual.",
        "In addition, the majority of foreign capital in Taiwan is held in the form of stock holdings, and data also pointed to little change in the balance of foreign investor holdings of Taiwanese government bonds and NTD deposits.",
        "These showed that the widening interest rate spread between the US and Taiwan was not the main driver for the recent foreign capital outflow.",
        "One board director stated that the domestic inflation rate had been above 2% since April 2021 and was expected to remain so for the rest of 2022, longer than previously projected, while surveyed data also showed that experts and scholars still envisaged inflation exceeding 2% next year.",
        "If the coronavirus outbreak eases in the second half year or sometime in the future, domestic economic activity would rebound.",
        "Persistent price uptrends would continue to buoy inflation expectations.",
        "Therefore, it is important for future monetary policy deliberations to focus on the issue of inflation and inflation expectations.",
        "Several board directors discussed economic uncertainties lying ahead and a wider US-Taiwan interest rate differential, and stated that the Bank’s monetary policy conduct should be more nimble.",
        "If needed, the Bank may hold emergency meetings of Executive Directors before the next scheduled meeting so as to make swift, nimble policy adjustments as warranted.",
        "The board directors reached a unanimous vote to raise the discount rate, the rate on refinancing of secured loans, and the rate on temporary accommodations by 12.5 basis points to 1.5%, 1.875%, and 3.75%, respectively; and to increase the reserve requirement ratios on NT dollar demand deposits and time (savings) deposits by 25 basis points.",
        "The Board judged that raising both the policy rates and the reserve requirement ratios would send a clear message that the Bank continues to adopt a monetary policy stance of tightening.",
        "This will help strengthen the policy effects and rein in domestic inflation expectations, so as to achieve the policy objectives of price stability and sound financial and economic development.",
        "The Board decided unanimously to raise the discount rate, the rate on refinancing of secured loans, and the rate on temporary accommodations to 1.5%, 1.875%, and 3.75%, respectively, effective June 17, 2022.",
        "The Board also decided unanimously to increase the reserve requirement ratios on NT dollar demand deposits and time (savings) deposits by 0.25 percentage points each, effective July 1, 2022.",
        "The board directors and supervisors approved unanimously to issue the press release in the post-meeting press conference, together with the Supplementary Materials for the Post-Monetary Policy Meeting Press Conference prepared by the Bank.",
        "Since the Board met in March this year, the continued Russia-Ukraine conflict has pushed up commodity prices, and the strict pandemic-related restrictions in China have exacerbated international supply chain bottlenecks, significantly heightening global inflationary pressures.",
        "Meanwhile, further policy rate hikes by central banks in major economies like the US have induced tighter financial conditions.",
        "As a result, it is expected that growth momentum for the global economy is likely to soften this year.",
        "Recent global financial market turbulence has also intensified in the wake of monetary tightening in major economies.",
        "International institutions have further downgraded their forecasts for the 2022 global economic growth and revised this year's global inflation forecasts upwards.",
        "Looking ahead, the global economy is still clouded by multiple downside risks, mainly including the Russia-Ukraine conflict, inflation expectations likely being pushed up by high global inflation, a slowdown in China's economic growth, and tightening international financial conditions, which could weigh on global production as well as economic and trade activity.",
        "Moreover, recurring COVID-19 pandemic outbreaks would also add uncertainties to the global economy.",
        "In the first quarter of the year, bolstered by growth in exports and private investment, the domestic economy expanded at a solid pace.",
        "The manufacturing sector showed steady expansion, while the services sector gradually recovered.",
        "In terms of labor market conditions, the unemployment rate fell slightly compared to the same period of the previous year, whereas the number of employed persons recorded a modest year-on-year decrease.",
        "As inflation was elevated, the average real total earnings of all payroll employees in the industrial and services sectors only registered marginal growth, and there remained a pronounced difference in wage growth across sectors.",
        "The domestic COVID-19 resurgence since mid-April caused companies to institute more furloughs, and consumers shied away from dining out and travel.",
        "As a result, consumer spending slumped, and the recovery of domestically-oriented services sectors faltered.",
        "Looking ahead to the second half of the year, though the global economic expansion is likely to moderate, it is expected that continued demand for emerging technology applications and digital transformation-related products would support Taiwan's export growth.",
        "Private investment is projected to extend the uptrend, and government consumption is also set to increase, while private consumption would gradually pick up once the domestic coronavirus outbreak eases.",
        "The Bank forecasts Taiwan's economy to grow by 3.75% this year, lower than the March forecast of 4.05%.",
        "From the beginning of 2022, domestic prices of food and oil-related products were pushed up by rising import costs, and domestic harvests of fruit and vegetables were restrained by unfavorable weather conditions, leading the consumer price index (CPI) annual growth rate to trend upwards.",
        "For the first five months of the year, the annual growth rates of the CPI and core CPI (excluding fruit, vegetables, and energy items) averaged 3.04% and 2.33%, respectively.",
        "The Bank expects the inflation rate to gradually come down in the second half of the year but still at elevated levels.",
        "For the year as a whole, the Bank revises the CPI and core CPI annual growth rate projections upwards to 2.83% and 2.42%, respectively.",
        "Recently, banks' excess reserves stood around NT$70 billion.",
        "The annual growth rate of bank loans and investments averaged 8.62% for the first four months of the year, while that of M2 (on a daily average basis) registered 7.94% for the same period.",
        "Meanwhile, short- and long-term market interest rates both rose higher.",
        "In today's meeting, the Board considered these developments in domestic and foreign economic and financial conditions.",
        "Given mounting pressures of imported inflation fueled by rising international commodity prices, domestic inflation is expected to remain elevated.",
        "Meanwhile, as the recent surge of COVID-19 infections at home disrupted the recovery of domestically-oriented services sectors, private consumption growth would likely weaken.",
        "In addition, shrouded by downside risks, a more subdued global economic outlook could further weigh on Taiwan's growth momentum.",
        "The Board judged that raising both the policy rates and the reserve requirement ratios would send a clear message that the Bank continues to adopt a monetary policy stance of tightening.",
        "This will help strengthen the policy effects and rein in domestic inflation expectations, so as to achieve the policy objectives of price stability and sound financial and economic development.",
        "The Board decided unanimously at the meeting today to raise the discount rate, the rate on refinancing of secured loans, and the rate on temporary accommodations to 1.5%, 1.875%, and 3.75%, respectively, effective June 17, 2022.",
        "The Board also decided unanimously to increase the reserve requirement ratios on NT dollar demand deposits and time (savings) deposits by 0.25 percentage points each, effective July 1, 2022.",
        "Against the backdrop of intense inflationary pressures and significant downside risks faced by the global economy, the Bank will closely monitor implications for domestic price trends resulting from the Russia-Ukraine conflict and other geopolitical risks, international commodity price movements, and the global pandemic progress.",
        "The Bank will also closely monitor how the monetary policy tightening of major economies would affect economic and financial conditions at home and abroad.",
        "Based on these assessments, the Bank may adjust its monetary policy timely and appropriately to fulfill its statutory duties of maintaining financial and price stability and fostering economic development.",
        "The Bank's selective credit control measures, first introduced in December 2020 and adjusted three times later, have so far successfully slowed down the expansion of construction and housing loans and kept real estate loan concentration broadly steady, thereby bolstering banks' credit risk management.",
        "As the government's cross-agency efforts proceeded further under the Healthy Real Estate Market Plan and the renewed pandemic waves created additional concerns, trading in the housing market has cooled somewhat for the year to date.",
        "Moreover, the monetary policy tightening would also boost the effectiveness of the existing credit controls.",
        "The Bank will stay attentive to developments in real estate lending, continue to review the implementation of the selective credit control measures, and make adjustments as needed to promote financial stability.",
        "When seasonal or irregular factors (such as massive inflows or outflows of short-term capital) lead to excess volatility and disorderly movements in the NT dollar exchange rate with adverse implications for economic and financial stability, the Bank, in line with its statutory mandates, will step in to maintain an orderly market."

        "During the first five months of the year, the CPI rose by 2.24% on average over the \nsame period last year, remaining on a gradual decline.",
        "Key drivers contributing to the \nrise included rising food prices (such as food away from home and fruit), higher housing \nrent, and prices rises for personal effects and entertainment services, with a combined \ncontribution of 1.51 percentage points, or 67%, to the rise in the CPI annual growth rate.",
        "By frequency of purchase, during the first five months of the year, top staple items \nand the items purchased  more often  both recorded  slower price rises  compared to the \nsame period last year.",
        "During this period from January to May, import prices and prices \nof domestic sales excluding imports both continued to record negative growth, \nindicating an absence of imported inflation pressures.",
        "By type of items, the pace of services CPI inflation slowed down in May because \nof a higher base effect.",
        "For the first five months of the year, the annual growth rate of \nthe services CPI was 2.58% and that of the commodity CPI was 1.87%.",
        "For the outlook of 2024 as a whole, domestic commodity prices would likely rise \nmildly given that international oil prices were forecasted by foreign institutions to run \nhigher  than  2023.",
        "Domestic  services  prices  were  expected  to  show  a  slower  increase \nowing to a high base effect.",
        "The Bank slightly revised downward its 2024 forecasts for \nthe CPI and core CPI annual growth rates to 2.12% and 2.00% and expected the inflation \nrate  to  come  down  to  close  to  2%  in  the  second  half  of  the  year.",
        "Headline  inflation \nforecasts by major domestic and foreign institutions ranged between 1.71% and 2.40% \nfor year 2024.",
        "Key  factors  affecting  the  future  path  of  domestic  prices  this  year  include  the \nfollowing.",
        "Upside  pressures  could  arise  from  (1)  higher-than-last-year  oil  prices  this \nyear,  as  well  as  upturns  in  the  R/J  CRB  commodity  futures  and  sea  freight  fares;  (2) \ndomestic rent increases; (3) strong domestic consumer demand for leisure and \nentertainment services, pushing up prices of restaurant and hospitality services; (4) the \nuniversal  hike  in  domestic  electricity  tariffs  in  April  this  year.",
        "On  the  other  hand, \ndownside pressures could come from reductions in prices of mobile phones and other \ncommunication devices and from a higher base effect in the second half of the year for \nfruit and vegetable prices.",
        "In terms of price trends, a gradual decline is projected for Taiwan’s inflation rate \nthis year, with the rate coming down to close to 2% in the second half of the year.",
        "In terms of economic growth, the Bank forecasts Taiwan’s economy to expand by \n3.77% year on year in 2024 owing to a lower base effect but estimated the output \ngap to be slightly negative while the momentum for business sector expansion \nremains mild.",
        "Regarding the proposition to adjust the selective credit control measures alongside a \nhike in the reserve requirement ratios.",
        "Since December 2020, the Bank has made five amendments to the Regulations \nGoverning  the  Extension  of  Mortgage  Loans  by  Financial  Institutions, and the \nannual growth rate of banks’ real estate loans has dropped from its peak in 2021.",
        "However, housing transactions had increased since the second half of 2023, driving \nthe annual growth rate of housing loans continuously higher.",
        "The annual growth rate \nof banks’ real estate loans also rebounded from 5.3% at the end of July last year to \n7.6% at the end of April this year.",
        "Recently, the ratio of real estate lending to total lending of all banks remained \nelevated.",
        "Moreover, since the June 2023 introduction of a 70% loan-to-value (LTV) \nratio cap on natural persons’  second outstanding home loans for housing in the \ndesignated “specific areas,” this loan bracket (hereinafter “the second ‘specific area’ \nhousing loans”) had seen its loan disbursement amount on the rise, making it one of \nthe key drivers of real estate loan growth.",
        "It was thus judged that more prudent \nmanagement of this loan bracket would be appropriate.",
        "In this view, with the aim of \nenhancing bank management of credit risk associated with the real estate sector, the \nBank decided to lower the aforementioned LTV ratio cap from 70% to 60%.",
        "The ratio of real estate lending to total lending of all banks was high, standing at \n37.21% as of April 2024.",
        "The Bank’s data on domestic banks’ loan disbursement for the second “specific \narea” housing loans showed that the amount had gradually increased since July \n2023, reaching NT$13.8 billion in 2023 Q3, NT$27.7 billion in 2023 Q4, and \nNT$30.0 billion in 2024 Q1.",
        "The data also showed that the average LTV ratio of this loan bracket had stayed \nhigh since July 2023.",
        "At 68.15% as of April 2024, it already exceeded 60%, \nwhich was the ceiling imposed on this loan bracket during December 2010 to \nFebruary 2016.",
        "A concurrent hike by 0.25 percentage points in the reserve requirement ratios on NT \ndollar deposits would help strengthen the effectiveness of today’s selective credit \ncontrol adjustments by adding quantity management of money and credit.",
        "Raising the reserve requirement ratios (RRRs) is expected to have the following \neffects: (1) Requiring banks to retain more funds as reserves would directly \ninfluence the quantity of loanable funds of banks, creating a credit tightening \neffect and sending a clear message by announcing the policy action, as well as \nlocking in liquidity for a longer term; (2) a lower money multiplier would bring \ndown the annual M2 growth rate; (3) reduction in funds available in banks \nwould rein in money market liquidity, which would likely drive money market \ninterest rates upwards.",
        "It is estimated that the 0.25 percentage point hike in the RRRs would lead to a \ncombined increase of approximately NT$120 billion in banks’ required reserves.",
        "This would not only reduce liquidity levels instantly and effectively, but also \nguide banks towards more prudent investment decisions and loan approvals, \nwhich would help further slow down credit flows into the real estate market.",
        "Policy Propositions: To keep the discount rate, the rate on refinancing of secured \nloans, and the rate on temporary accommodations unchanged at 2%, 2.375%, \nand 4.25%, respectively; to adjust the selective credit control measures; to raise \nthe reserve requirement ratios on NT dollar deposits by 0.25 percentage points.",
        "Board members reached a unanimous decision on the policy rate hold, the \nadjustments  to  the  selective  credit  control  measures,  and  the  0.25  percentage  point \nhike in the reserve requirement ratios on NT dollar deposits.",
        "Related discussions are \nsummarized as follows.",
        "(1) Discussions regarding the policy rate decision \nOne board director pointed out that the domestic economy was gradually firming \nup, and inflation continued with a broad downtrend without an expected surge following \nthe April electricity tariff hike.",
        "Therefore, the director supported the rate hold \nproposition.",
        "Another board director also stated that the April electricity tariff hike had a limited \neffect  on  the  domestic  inflation  rate.",
        "Although  the  annual  CPI  growth  rate  was \nforecasted to slightly exceed 2% this year, the Bank’s discount rate also came to 2%, \nthe highest in 15 years after the 0.125 percentage point hike in March 2024.",
        "In addition, \ndata  on  exports  in  the  year  up  to  May  showed  that  only  AI-related  ICT/AV  exports \nrecorded  fast  growth  whereas  the  rest  product  categories  posted  negative  growth.",
        "A \nfurther rate hike in today’s meeting by another 0.125 percentage points could then add \nto  the  interest  burden  of  firms  in  traditional  industrial  sectors  as  well  as  small  and \nmedium-sized  enterprises.",
        "The  director  therefore  supported  a  rate  hold  but  stressed \ncontinuous monitoring of domestic inflationary pressures.",
        "One board director noted that, despite a modest downgrade of the Bank’s forecast \nfor Taiwan’s 2024 annual CPI growth rate, this forecast put the timing of inflation \ncoming down to below 2% at the fourth quarter of the year, instead of the third quarter \nas forecasted during the March Board Meeting.",
        "This highlighted the degree of \nuncertainty inherent in inflation forecasting.",
        "One board director, expressing support for a rate hold, noted that Taiwan and the \nUS witnessed similar economic and financial trends recently, including a robust labor \nmarket, strong stock market rallies, and cooling inflation.",
        "On the other hand, the Bank \ndelivered a 0.125 percentage point hike in the March 2024 meeting whereas the US Fed \nmaintained rate holds in the meantime.",
        "And the Bank would need to monitor Taiwan’s \nThe RRR hike would also help guide market interest rates upward, similar to the effect \nof monetary policy tightening or policy rate hikes.",
        "One of these board directors pointed \nout that the Bank had previously adopted a similar policy mix where it raised the policy \nrates and the RRRs at the same time, a strategy aiming to manage price (interest rates) \nand quantity (money stock) in parallel.",
        "The proposed actions at today’s meeting was a \npolicy  mix  of  two  quantity-related  tools  by  adjusting  the  selective  credit  control \nmeasures alongside an RRR hike.",
        "Also, raising the RRRs would guide money market \nrates upwards.",
        "For instance, since the Bank began a rate hiking cycle in March 2022, \nthe one-month commercial paper secondary market rate had risen by 1.198 percentage \npoints,  the  2-10  day  (reverse)  repo  market  rate  had  risen  by  1.031  percentage  points, \nboth greater than the 0.875 percentage points rise in the Bank’s discount rate so far in \nthis cycle, which were partly due to the effect of policy rate hikes combining two RRR \nhikes.",
        "One board director noted that strong housing demand was insufficiently met owing \nto shortfalls in new projects for sale and new housing starts.",
        "The situation was consistent \nwith  what  was  shown  in  the  recent  financial  data  where  the  annual  growth  rate  of \nconstruction loans continued declining but that of housing loans continued rising.",
        "The \ncurrent  supply-demand  imbalance  in  the  housing  market  cannot  be  addressed  by \nmonetary policy tools alone.",
        "While the RRR hike would help contain real estate lending \nby reducing overall liquidity, resolving the imbalance  still requires means outside the \nBank’s capacity.",
        "One board director gave support for the proposition to lower the LTV ratio cap on \nthe second “specific area” housing loans to 60%, stating that the cap was likely better \nreceived  by  the  public  since  it  was  imposed  before  during  2010-2016.",
        "Meanwhile, \nraising the RRRs by 0.25 percentage points was to require banks to increase the reserves \nthey already retain and the impact on banking operations should be limited.",
        "Another board director pointed out that a housing market cooldown can primarily \nbe  achieved  by  affecting  price  and/or  quantity.",
        "The  price-related  strategy  is  through \ninterest  rates;  however,  interest  rate  tools  would  not  only  affect  housing  market \ntransactions but also impact investment and consumption.",
        "In addition, such a tool would \nrequire a massive scale to meaningfully affect housing market trends.",
        "On the other hand, \na quantity-related strategy by reducing liquidity would be more effective as it exerts a \ngreater force more directly on the housing market.",
        "While today’s RRR hike was mainly \naimed at the housing market, the Bank should also pay attention to any potential impact \non  consumption,  investment,  and  market  interest  rates  arising  from  the  reduction  of \nmoney supply.",
        "One board director remarked that given the complexity of the housing price issue \nin Taiwan, it cannot be resolved by monetary policy alone.",
        "Supply-side factors including \nconstruction  costs,  urban  planning,  and  social  housing  add  to  the  complexity  of  this \nissue.",
        "What  the  Bank  can  do  in  its  capacity  would  be  adopting  policies  to  contain \nspeculative transactions as an effort to dampen housing price growth, not to crush the \nprices.",
        "Considering  that  real  estate-related  lending  still  takes  up  a  large  proportion  in \nbank credit, the director agreed with the proposition to adjust selective credit controls \nand to hike the RRRs in order to promote financial stability.",
        "One board director pointed out that Taiwan had witnessed a continuous rise in the \nannual  growth  rate  of  housing  transfers,  record-breaking  housing  prices,  and  a  broad \nuptrend in the ratio of real estate lending to total bank lending since June 2023, all of \nwhich  indicated  that  the  housing  market  was  not  cooling  down.",
        "Hence,  the  director \nsupported the proposition of selective credit control adjustments and the RRR hike.",
        "One  board  director  noted  that  if  today’s  selective  credit  control  adjustments \neffectively cool down the housing market, it would help stabilize rent increases, thereby \nremoving upside pressures on CPI inflation induced by higher rent.",
        "Another board director pointed out that while a lower LTV ratio cap of 60% on the \nsecond “specific area” housing loans would achieve certain effectiveness in containing \nhousing price rises, it is important to monitor potential near-term surges in the pre-sale \nhousing market after the new cap is implemented.",
        "Several board directors expressed concern about the aforementioned cap tightening \nadversely impacting home-movers, and suggested the Bank communicate to the public \nabout relevant home-mover assistance measures.",
        "One of these directors pointed out that \nupon the June 2023 introduction of this LTV ratio cap, a supplementary policy measure \nwas  implemented  concurrently  to  exempt  home-movers  within  a  one-year  window \nconditional upon signed affidavits.",
        "Since then, close to 10% of home-mover borrowers \nhad availed this conditional loan approval policy, which would continue to be applied \nto today’s new cap tightening.",
        "In this view, the  director  expressed  support  for  the \nproposed selective credit control adjustments.",
        "The board directors decided unanimously to keep the discount rate, the rate on \nrefinancing  of  secured  loans,  and  the  rate  on  temporary  accommodations \nunchanged at 2%, 2.375%, and 4.25%, respectively, to adjust the selective credit \ncontrol  measures,  and  to  raise  the  reserve  requirement  ratios  on  NT  dollar \ndeposits by 0.25 percentage points.",
        "Since  the  Board  met  in  March  this  year,  indicators  have  pointed  to  continuous \nexpansion in the global manufacturing and services sectors.",
        "Nevertheless, the effects \nof  major  economies'  monetary  tightening  and  ongoing  geopolitical  conflicts  have \ncontinued to dampen global economic growth momentum.",
        "Meanwhile, inflation rates \nin major economies have come down rather slowly because of stickiness in the prices \nof  services.",
        "International  institutions  forecast  mild  global  economic  growth  and \nfurther yet slow declines in global inflation this year.",
        "As  the  economic  performance  and  the  progress  of  disinflation  varied  across  major \neconomies,  the  pace  of  their  monetary  policy  adjustments  also  diverged.",
        "The  US \nFederal  Reserve  kept  the  policy  rate  unchanged,  while  the  European  Central  Bank \npivoted to a rate cut last week.",
        "The Bank of Japan moved towards monetary policy \nnormalization,  and  the  People's  Bank  of  China  continued  with  its  accommodative \nmonetary policy stance.",

        "During  the  first  quarter  of  the year,  strong  demand  for  emerging  technology \napplications such as artificial intelligence (AI) significantly bolstered Taiwan's export \ngrowth.",
        "Meanwhile, private consumption rose steadily, and private investment posted \na smaller contraction.",
        "As a result, the domestic economy expanded at a faster-than-\nexpected  pace.",
        "For  the  second  quarter,  the  economy  was  expected  to  exhibit  solid \ngrowth, with data in recent months showing a rebound in private investment as well \nas continuous growth in exports and private consumption.",
        "In terms of labor market \nconditions in the year to date, the unemployment rate registered lower than that in the \nsame period last year, the number of employed persons increased, and nominal total \npayroll earnings rose faster.",
        "Looking  into  the  second  half  of  the  year,  private  consumption  will  likely  continue \nwith mild growth, while a rebound in global final demand and the ever-brightening \nbusiness prospects of emerging tech applications are both expected to buttress export \ngrowth momentum and boost private investment.",

        "For the first five  months of the  year, the annual growth rate  of the  consumer price \nindex  (CPI)  averaged  2.24%,  mainly  reflecting  increases  in  the  prices  of  food \n(particularly food away from home and fruit) and housing rent, as well as uptrends in \nthe prices of personal effects and entertainment services.",
        "The annual growth rate of \nthe core CPI (excluding vegetables, fruit, and energy items) continued slowing down \ngradually, averaging 2.06% during the same period.",

        "The Board decided unanimously to keep the policy rates unchanged, to adjust the \nselective credit control measures, and to raise the reserve requirement ratios by 0.25 \npercentage points \nAt the meeting today, the Board considered the balance of incoming data on economic \nand financial conditions at home and abroad.",
        "The domestic inflation rate has gradually \ncome down in the year to date and would continue to ease to around 2% in the second \nhalf of the year.",
        "Meanwhile, the domestic economy would likely expand at a moderate \npace this  year and the output gap is expected to be modestly negative.",

        "Based on such assessment, the Bank will \nadjust its monetary policy in a timely manner as warranted, so as to fulfill the statutory \nduties of maintaining financial and price stability and fostering economic \ndevelopment within the scope of the aforementioned objectives.",
        "The Bank has made five amendments to its selective credit control measures since \nDecember 2020, which have helped banks mitigate risks associated with real estate \nlending.",
        "The nonperforming loan ratio of real estate loans has since remained low, \nindicating good credit quality.",
        "Nevertheless, housing market transactions began to pick up in the second half of last \nyear, leading to a continuous upturn in the annual growth rate of housing loans.",
        "As a \nresult, the ratio of real estate lending to total lending of all banks remains elevated.",
        "Moreover, since the June 2023 introduction of a 70% loan-to-value (LTV) ratio cap \non  natural  persons'  second  outstanding  home  loans  for  housing  in  the  designated \nspecific  areas,  this  loan  bracket  has  seen  its  loan  disbursement  amount  on  the  rise.",
        "Therefore, to further enhance management of bank credit resources and reduce related \ncredit risk, the Bank decided to amend the Regulations Governing the Extension of \nMortgage Loans by Financial Institutions to lower the aforementioned LTV ratio cap \non natural persons' second outstanding home loans for housing in the specific areas to \n60%, effective June 14, 2024 (Appendix 1).",
        "In  addition,  the  Bank  judged  that  a  concurrent  hike  in  reserve  requirement  ratios \nwould reinforce the effect of the above credit control measures via enhanced quantity \nmanagement of money and credit, thereby helping to further contain excessive credit \nflows  into  the  real  estate  market.",
        "The  Board  thus  decided  to  raise  the  reserve \nrequirement  ratios  on  NT  dollar  passbook  and  time  (savings)  deposits  by  0.25 \npercentage points, effective July 1, 2024 (Appendix 2).",

        "In  this  view,  the  Bank  forecasted  real  private \ninvestment to pick up pace in the second half of 2024 and to record mild growth for the\nyear as a whole with the growth momentum extending into next year.",
        "In respect of private consumption, as the domestic economy continued recovering, \nreal earnings growth regained momentum, and consumer confidence rose high.",
        "Against \nthis background, the Bank forecasted continuous real growth in private consumption in \nthe second half of 2024 and the year as a whole.",
        "For next year, private consumption was \nforecasted to grow mildly, with disposable income to be boosted by a scheduled hike in \nthe minimum wage and public sector pay next year and stronger corporate willingness \nto raise pay thanks to stronger profits in the first half of this year.",
        "In  the  labor  market,  recent  data  showed  the  total  number  of  employed  persons \nincreased month by month and the unemployment rate in July posted the lowest same-\nmonth  record  in  nearly  24  years,  despite  a  seasonal  rebound.",
        "Regarding  employee \nearnings, growth in total nominal earnings had picked up pace since the beginning of \nthe year, averaging 4.06% for the first seven months of the year, a new period high in \nnearly 10 years.",
        "Overall, given a stronger-than-expected economic expansion in the first half of the \nyear, the Bank slightly upgraded its GDP growth forecast for year 2024 to 3.82%, raising \nby 0.05 percentage points from its June forecast.",
        "However, the second half of the year \nwas forecasted to slow down from the 5.83% registered in the first half year to 1.99% \nowing to a higher base effect.",
        "For the outlook of next year, as continuous expansion in the global economy and \ntrade were expected to bolster Taiwan’s exports and private investment, coupled with \ncontinuous private consumption growth, the Bank forecasted the economy to expand by \n3.08%  in  2025.",
        "In  addition,  the  Bank  estimated  that  Taiwan  would  have  a  slightly \nnegative output gap in both 2024 and 2025.",
        "Growth projections by major institutions at \nhome and abroad ranged between 3.57% and 4.50% for this  year and between 1.97% \nand 4.40% for next year.",

        "In the period of June to August 2024, banks’ \nexcess reserves averaged above NT$45 billion.",
        "In terms of market interest rates, short-\nterm rates rose slightly in July, reflecting the Bank’s previous hike in the reserve \nrequirement ratios (RRRs) and the impact from firms distributing cash dividends.",
        "From \nAugust  onwards,  short-term  interest  rates  fluctuated  within  a  tight  range,  owing  to \nfrequent  foreign  capital  movements  as  well  as  the  aforementioned  cash  dividend \ndistribution.",
        "Showing the effectiveness of the Bank’s monetary policy instruments in \nguiding market interest rates, most of the money market rates and banks’ deposit/lending \nrates had “sufficiently” risen in reflection of the Bank’s policy rate increases.",
        "In terms of bank credit, with home mortgages and personal working capital loans \ncontinuing to rise year on year since May 2024 and the corporate sector also showing \ngreater  funding demand amid steady  export growth,  the annual growth rate of banks’ \nloans and investments rose month by month during the  year, averaging 7.73% for the \nfirst eight months of 2024.",
        "In terms of money supply trends since April this year, the annual growth rate of the \nmonetary aggregate M2 first rose to 6.25% in June alongside the rising annual growth \nrate  of  loans  and  investments;  afterwards,  M2  growth  dropped  to  an  annual  pace  of \n5.80% in August owing to net capital outflows.",
        "For the first eight months of the year, \nthe annual growth rate of M2 averaged 5.94%, within the 2.5%-6.5% reference range.",
        "In the housing market, the volume of housing transactions had risen markedly in \nboth the designated “specific areas” (currently including six metropolitan areas, Hsinchu \nCounty, and Hsinchu City) and in the non-specific areas since August 2023.",
        "Data also \nshowed that building ownership transfers in these two area categories rose year on year \nby  33.3%  and  24.3%  in  July  2024,  respectively.",
        "In  addition,  housing  prices  of  new \nhousing projects and existing homes had continued to rise faster since the second half \nof last year.",

        "The \nratio  of  real  estate  loans to total loans (concentration of banks’ lending in real estate \nloans) increased to 37.5% at the end of August, close to the historical high of 37.9%.",
        "Considering the current severe imbalance of bank credit skewed towards the real estate \nsector, the Bank, as a precaution, met with a total of 34 domestic banks in mid-August, \nasking them to conduct internal management over a one-year horizon to rein in the total \namount  of  real  estate  lending  but  not  to  adversely  impact  the  funding  needs  of  non-\nhomeowners applying  for owner-occupied housing loans, or real  estate sector entities \nlooking to finance their projects of urban renewal or  reconstruction of old and unsafe \nbuildings.",
        "Regarding price trends from June 2024 onwards, weather-induced surges in prices \nof vegetables and fruit drove the annual growth rate of the consumer price index (CPI) \nupwards, but the figure went down to 2.36% in August.",
        "Excluding fruit, vegetables, and \nenergy items, the annual growth rate of the core CPI continued to slowly come down to \n1.80% in August 2024, the lowest since February 2024.",
        "During the first eight months of the year, the annual growth rate of the CPI averaged \n2.32%  mainly  owing  to  rising  food  prices  (such  as  fruit  and  food  away  from  home), \nhousing  rent  hikes,  and  price  rises  in  personal  effects,  entertainment  services,  and \nmedical  fees,  which  combined  to  contribute  1.75  percentage  points,  or  about  75%,  to \nthe rise in the CPI annual growth rate.",
        "By  frequency  of  purchase,  the  items  purchased  frequently  recorded  slower  price \nrises in the recent month.",
        "Import prices and prices of domestic sales excluding imports \nposted  a  year-on-year  increase  of  1.08%  and  0.82%,  respectively,  for  the  first  eight \nmonths of the year, indicating an absence of imported inflation pressures.",
        "By type of items, the services CPI recorded slower year-on-year growth in August \n2024 owing to a higher base  effect.",
        "For the first  eight  months  of the  year,  the annual \ngrowth rate of the services CPI was 2.06% and that of the commodity CPI was 2.54%.",
        "For  the  outlook  of  2024  as  a  whole, given  that  late  July  saw  fruit  and  vegetable \nprices surged in the aftermath of typhoons and torrential rain, the Bank slightly revised \nup this year’s forecast for the CPI annual growth rate to 2.16% while slightly revised \ndown  the  forecast  for  the  core  CPI  annual  growth  rate  to  1.94%.",
        "For  next  year, \ninternational institutions expected global oil prices to be steady; meanwhile, domestic \nservices inflation would likely continue with a gradual downtrend.",
        "In this view, the Bank \nforecasted that in 2025 the CPI and core CPI annual growth rates would ease further to \n1.89%  and  1.79%,  respectively.",

        "Key  factors  affecting  the  future  path  of  domestic  prices  include  the  following.",
        "Upside pressures could arise from (1) severe damage from typhoon and torrential rain \nleading to rises in fruit and vegetable prices owing to a reduction in supply; (2) prices \nof food such as food away from home and  meat trending upwards, along with upside \npressures  for  housing  rent;  (3)  tour  agencies  hiking  tour  group  fees;  (4)  the  effect  of \ncarbon  fees  to  be  launched  next  year;  (5)  the  minimum  wage  and  public  sector  pay \nscheduled for an increase next year.",
        "On the other hand, downside pressures could come \nfrom a downtrend in communication devices such as mobile phones and from reductions \nin prices of communication services.",
        "Domestic inflation has continued to come down gradually in the year so far and is \nexpected to drop to below 2% next year.",
        "The domestic economy is expected to expand mildly in the second half of 2024 and \nin 2025 while the output gap is estimated to be slightly negative for both 2024 and \n2025.",
        "Regarding the adjustment of the selective credit control measures alongside a hike in \nthe reserve requirement ratios.",
        "Beginning December 2020, the Bank has made six amendments to the Regulations \nGoverning  the  Extension  of  Mortgage  Loans  by  Financial  Institutions, and the \nannual growth rate of banks’ real estate loans has since dropped from its peak of \n2021.",
        "Entering the second half of 2023, though, growth in housing transactions \nrebounded and housing prices climbed at a faster pace, driving a continuous rise in \nhousing loans.",
        "As a result, annual growth of banks’ real estate loans climbed back \nup rapidly, leading to a higher loan concentration in real estate loans that came close \nto a historical high as of August 2024.",
        "(a) The annual growth rate of housing loans rose back up from 4.5% at the end of \nMay 2023 to 11.0% at the end of August 2024, a new record high for almost 18 \nyears (since May 2006).",
        "The annual growth rate of construction loans also \nrebounded from 2.7% at the end of May 2024 to 5.0% at the end of August 2024.",
        "(b) The annual growth rate of real estate loans also increased from 5.3% at the end \nof July 2023 to 9.4% at the end of August 2024.",
        "(c) At the end of August 2024, the ratio of real estate lending to total lending was \n37.5%, close to the historical high of 37.9% registered at the end of October \n2009.",
        "The aforementioned record ratio of 37.9% was registered in October 2009, \nwhen real estate loans and the other loans (i.e., total loans minus real estate \nloans) all posted slower growth as the global financial crisis dragged the world \neconomic  growth  down,  with  the  other  loans  showing  a  more  marked \nslowdown.",
        "In comparison, since the second half of 2023, real estate loans and \nthe other loans had grown in step amid the domestic economic recovery, with \nreal estate loans posting stronger gains.",
        "Compared to the situation around the \nend  of  October  2009,  the  present  day  was  witnessing  a  more  alarming \nimbalance of banks’ credit resources gravitating towards the real estate-related \nsectors.",
        "Internationally,  there  have  been  precedents  of  financial  crises  and  economic \nrecessions caused by an overheating real estate market.",
        "In the spirit of prudence, it is \nnecessary to take further actions to remediate the alarmingly high concentration of \nreal estate lending in Taiwan’s banks.",
        "Therefore, to contain housing speculation and \nproperty hoarding, and to prioritize the channeling of credit resources towards non-\nhomeowners  seeking  owner-occupied  housing,  the  Board  would  consider  the \nfollowing amendments to the selective credit controls:   \n(a) Imposing a new rule that no grace periods should be granted to a natural person \napplying for a first outstanding home loan  when the  person already owns \nbuilding(s) to his/her name.",
        "This is aimed at preventing such borrowers from \nusing financial leverages for speculative homebuying and reinforcing banks’ \ncredit risk management.",
        "－It is estimated that nearly 20% of housing loan applications belong to people \nwho seek new home loans despite already owning residential properties.",
        "Given \nthe size of such applicants, granting them grace periods that allows interest-\nonly repayments could aid short-term speculative homebuying.",
        "(b) Lowering the cap on the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio to 50% of natural persons’ \nsecond  outstanding  home  loans  and  widening  the  applicable  scope  (from \nhousing in the designated “specific areas”') to housing nationwide.",
        "For housing \nloans to corporate entities, high-value housing loans, and the third (or more) \nhousing loans to natural persons, the LTV ratio caps would both be lowered to \n30%.",
        "By  reducing  the available amount  of loans potentially  taken out for \nproperty speculation, more loanable funds can thus be used for home loans to \nnon-homeowner borrowers.",
        "－Data showed that there had been a large number of new borrowers taking out \ntheir second outstanding housing loans, representing a share of about 17% in \nthe second quarter of 2024.",
        "Moreover, the total amount as well as the number \nof borrowers both surged for this loan bracket, rising by 97% and 71% year on \nyear,  respectively,  in  the  second  quarter  of  2024.",
        "This  phenomenon  also \n“spilled over” from the specific areas to the entire nation; in the first half of \n2024, for the bracket of a second outstanding housing loan taken out for \nhousing outside the specific areas, the loan amount and the applicant number \nincreased 49% and 20% year on year, respectively.",
        "Today’s new cap tightening \nwould not only prevent credit flows from being used for property hoarding, \nbut also help channel those credit towards priority use for home loans to non-\nhomeowners.",
        "The tightening of LTV caps on housing loans to corporate entities, high-value \nhousing loans, and the third (or more) housing loans to natural persons is \nmainly based on the consideration that such loans are mostly for non-owner-\nto  channel  credit  resources  towards  better  allocation,  which  in  turn  would  help  direct \navailable funds to fostering real economic activity such as investment and infrastructure-\nbuilding.",
        "Another  board director also pointed out that today’s measures would help \nrestrain housing prices to some extent and thus conducive to financial and price stability.",
        "One board director approved of the Bank’s recent moral suasion  on  banks  to \nenhance internal management of the total volume of real estate lending and stated that \ntoday’s policy moves – adjusting selective credit controls and raising the RRRs – would \nhelp  curb  excessive  credit  flows  to  the  real  estate  market.",
        "Another  board  director \nremarked that it takes longer for banks’ quantity management of real estate lending to \nwork  and  this  would  thus  fail  to  immediately  rectify  the  over-concentration  of  credit \nresources on real estate lending.",
        "On the other hand, the selective credit control measures \ncould be  deployed to keep new property  investors and new speculators from entering \nthe housing market by denying them easy access to banks’ housing credit.",
        "Furthermore, \nthe housing market, unlike stock markets, tends to seldom experience market corrections \nor  short-term  volatile price swings; the introduction of today’s measures might help \nbring about a housing market correction.",
        "Many board directors expressed the view that, regarding the proposed new rule to \nremove  grace  periods  on  first  outstanding  home  loans  by  borrowers  already  owning \nhousing  property,  exemption  should  be  applied  to  a  homeowner  whose  property  is \nowned through inheritance or the inherited property is not located in the city where the \nborrower  currently  resides  or  works.",
        "Several  board  directors  also  expressed  concern \nabout  the  situation  where  a  borrower  inherits  a  housing  property  with  an  outstanding \nloan but has to take out the second loan to buy a home because of job-related relocation, \nsubjecting the borrower to the new stricter credit controls of no grace period and lower \nLTV ratios.",
        "In this light, it was suggested that such particular cases and actual funding \nneeds of borrowers should be taken into consideration.",
        "Another  board  director  raised  concerns  about  the  situations  where  homebuyers \nalready  enter  into  contracts  via  real  estate  agencies  but  have  not  yet  submit  loan \napplications  to  banks,  or  where  buyers  of  presale  homes  already  sign  contracts  with \nhomebuilders but the loan cases have not yet been submitted to banks; in both situations, \ntoday’s new credit controls would cause the loans to fall short of the previously expected \namount owing to tighter LTV ratio caps.",
        "Several  board directors noted that it is never an easy task for policy measures to \ncover all the bases.",
        "One board director pointed out that following the policy launch, the \nBank  will  strive  to  address  problems  and  difficulties.",
        "Reviews  and  rectifications  will \nthen  be  conducted  after  some  time  into  the  policy  implementation,  with  a  focus  on \ncomprehensiveness and an understanding of specific cases.",
        "One  board  director  gave  opinion  on  the  RRR  adjustment,  stating  that  the  Bank \nshould move towards a path of slowly reducing the RRRs.",
        "The director noted that it does \nnot  seem  appropriate  for  monetary  policy  to  strike  solely  via  quantity-based  tools.",
        "In \naddition, some banks might be caught ill-prepared upon an RRR hike, potentially putting \nthe Bank in a position  to provide  liquidity  as  seen fit.",
        "Hence,  such a tool needs to be \nused with caution.",
        "In this view, adjusting monetary policy via an interest-rate channel \nmight be more effective in ensuring financial and price stability.",
        "Several board directors viewed that raising the RRRs would help rein in bank credit \nbut could also affect the ratio used for the regulatory limit where, as prescribed in Article \n72-2 of the Banking Act, banks’ construction-related lending (the numerator) shall not \nexceed 30% of the sum of deposits received and bank debentures issued (the \ndenominator).",
        "With an RRR hike, the denominator could shrink because banks have to \nset aside more funds as reserves, possibly reducing the amount of total deposits.",
        "As a \nresult of a smaller denominator, banks could find the regulatory limit of 30% closer in \nsight, making it more difficult for banks to grant housing credit to homebuyers.",
        "One director stated that in theory, an RRR hike would affect the quantity of banks’ \nloans and deposits, just as many other factors do, such as capital inflow/outflow, export \ngrowth, domestic economic conditions, etc.",
        "Take the previous RRR hike (effective July \n2024) for example.",
        "After the hike, the outstanding balance of bank loans continued to \nrise in the two months of July and August, and the outstanding balance of bank deposits \nrose before decreasing but still higher than the end of June.",
        "This indicated that in the \nmonths after the July RRR hike, banks continued to extend credit and receive deposits, \nwith the process of credit creation largely unaffected.",
        "Secondly, the August data showed \nthat the Article 72-2-stipulated ratio of domestic banks did not change significantly; the \nratio’s numerator (loans extended for residential construction and business construction) \nand  the  denominator  both  increased,  implying  little  effect  from  the  July  RRR  hike.",
        "Furthermore,  as  the  banking  system  continued  to  enjoy  ample  liquidity,  banks  had \nmostly responded to the RRR hike through early termination of their central bank-issued \ncertificates of deposit.",
        "In other words, raising the RRRs has not caused banks to record \na smaller denominator of the Article 72-2 ratio.",
        "One  board  director  remarked  that  the  RRR  hike  was  adopted  to  complement  the \nselective  credit  control  measures.",
        "Given  the  ample  liquidity,  it  would  be  hardly \nconcerning  that  there  might  be  any  liquidity  squeeze  in  the  banking  system.",
        "Another \nboard director pointed that, in fact, as early as the end of 2023, some banks had begun \nto  dial  down  real  estate  lending  as  they  came  close  to  the  aforementioned  regulatory \nlimit of 30% or their internal control level.",
        "Also, when a large number of housing loan \napplications swarmed to those banks still with space to lend, the sheer volume as well \nas a longer processing time usually needed for housing loan case reviews thus extended \nthe  wait  until  loan  approval  and  disbursement.",
        "In  other  words,  this  was  not  a  credit \ncrunch but just the result of banks complying with Article 72-2 of the Banking Act.",
        "The board directors decided unanimously to keep the discount rate, the rate on \nrefinancing  of  secured  loans,  and  the  rate  on  temporary  accommodations \nunchanged at 2%, 2.375%, and 4.25%, respectively, to adjust the selective credit \ncontrol  measures,  and  to  raise  the  reserve  requirement  ratios  on  NT  dollar \ndeposits by 0.25 percentage points.",
        "The board directors approved unanimously to issue the following press release in \nthe post-meeting press conference,  together  with the Supplementary  Materials for the \nPost-Monetary Policy Meeting Press Conference prepared by the Bank.",
        "Since  the  Board  met  in  June  this  year,  the  global  manufacturing  sector  has \nweakened to tepid growth, while the services sector has witnessed \ncontinuous  expansion.",
        "The  global  economy  has  sustained  mild  growth.",
        "In \nmore  recent  months,  international  oil  and  other  commodity  prices  trended \ndown, services price rises moderated, and global inflation further eased.",
        "From  mid-2024  onwards,  monetary  policy  paths  of  major  central  banks \ncontinued to diverge.",
        "The European and US central banks started their rate -\ncut cycles successively to avoid excessive tightening.",

        "Market \nattention to major central banks' monetary policy moves has induced greater \nvolatility in international financial markets.",
        "For  the  outlook  of  2024  and  2025,  international  institutions  projected  the  world \neconomy to grow at a moderate pace and the inflation rate to drop further.",
        "However, \nthe  international  economic  and  financial  outlooks  are  still  shrouded  in  many \nuncertainties, such as varied paces in monetary policy moves of major central banks, \ngeopolitical changes following the US presidential election, and the spillover effect \nof China's softening economy, as well as climate change and other potential impacts.",
        "In  the  months  since  midyear,  Taiwan's  exports  have  recorded  solid  growth, \nsupported  by  robust  demand  for  artificial  intelligence  and  other  emerging \ntechnology applications.",
        "With regard to domestic demand, private investment \ngained stronger momentum with capital equipment imports increasing \nsignificantly  in recent  months, and private consumption continued growing.",

        "The Bank's G DP \ngrowth forecast for the year as a whole was 3.82% (see Appendix Table 1 for \nthe  forecasts  by  major  institutions).",
        "In  the  labor  market,  the  number  of \nemployed persons continued increasing in recent months, the unemployment \nrate registered lower than that  in the same period last year, and total nominal \nearnings posted mild growth.",
        "For  the  outlook  of  next  year,  a  pickup  in  global  goods  trade   growth  and  the \ncontinuous  boom  in  emerging  tech  applications  would  continue  to  bolster \ngrowth in Taiwan's exports and  private investment.",
        "Meanwhile, as minimum \nwage  and  public  sector  pay  were  scheduled  to  be  raised  next  year,  private \nconsumption is expected to enjoy further growth.",

        "For year 2025, the Bank forecasted Taiwan's CPI and core CPI annual growth \nrates  to  slow  further  to  1.89%  and  1.79%  owing  to  a  stable  outlook  for \ninternational  oil  prices  as  expected  by  international  institutions  and  the \nprediction of continuous gradual easing in domestic services price increases.",

        "In  addition,  the  domestic  economy  is  expected  to \ncontinue expanding at a moderate pace both for the second half o f this year \nand  for  next  year,  with  a  modestly  negative  output  gap  for  both  years.",
        "Against this background, the Board judged that a rate hold would help foster \nsound economic and financial development on the whole.",

        "The nonperforming loan ratio of real estate loans has since \nremained low, indicating good credit quality.",
        "Nevertheless,  housing  market  transactions  began  to  climb  back  up  and  housing \nprices saw steeper rises in the second half of last year, leading the annual growth rate \nof housing loans to trend upwards continuously to 11.0% at the end of August this \nyear, the highest since May 2006.",
        "Furthermore, the annual growth rate of \nconstruction loans also picked up, reaching 5.0% at the end of August.",

        "Through  moral  suasion,  the  Bank  asked  these  banks  to  draw  up  a \nquantitative,  self-disciplinary  improvement  plan  covering  a  one-year  horizon  to \nreduce over-concentration of credit resources in loans to the real estate sector.",
        "Such \nplans shall not adversely impact the funding needs of non-homeowners applying for \nowner-occupied housing loans, or real estate sector entities looking to finance their \nprojects aligned with the government-promoted policies of urban renewal, \nreconstruction  of  old  and  unsafe  buildings,  and  affordable  housing,  or  corporates \nseeking capital to build or buy own-use plants or offices.",

        "In order to further reinforce management of banks' credit resources and to contain \nhousing market speculation and property hoarding, while prioritizing the channeling \nof credit resources towards non-homeowners seeking owner-occupied housing, the \nBank decided to make the following amendments to the Regulations Governing the \nExtension  of  Mortgage  Loans  by  Financial  Institutions,  effective  September  20, \n2024.",
        "The primary points to this amendment are as follows (Appendix 1):     \n(1)  Granting no grace period to a natural person's first outstanding home loan when \nthe borrower already owns building(s) to his/her name.",
        "(2)  Lowering the cap on the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, from 60% to 50%, of natural \npersons'  second  outstanding  home  loans  and  widening  the  applicable  scope \n(from housing in the designated ''specific areas'') to housing nationwide.",

        "(4)  Lowering the LTV ratio cap on unsold housing unit loans from 40% to 30%.",
        "In  addition,  the  Bank  judged  that  a  concurrent  hike  in  reserve  requirement  ratios \nwould reinforce the effect of the Bank's moral suasion and the above selective credit \ncontrols via enhanced quantity management of money and credit, thereby helping to \nfurther  contain  excessive  credit  flows  into  the  real  estate  market.",
        "The  Board  thus \ndecided  to  raise  the  reserve  requirement  ratios  on  NT  dollar  passbook  and  time \n(savings) deposits by 0.25 percentage points, effective October 1, 2024.",

        "This shaped a more acute sense of price rises in \nstaple items among consumers.",
        "Meanwhile, the price declines in international raw material prices led to continued \nnegative growth in  the  February  import prices and prices of domestic sales excluding \nimports,  indicating  further  easing  in  imported  inflation  pressures  and  supporting  a \nstabilization in domestic commodity prices.",
        "By type of items, the annual growth rate of the commodity CPI registered 2.22% \nfor  the  Jan.-Feb.  period,  whereas  that  of  the  services  CPI  posted  a  faster  increase  at \n2.62%.",
        "For  the  outlook  of  the  entire  year,  domestic  commodity  prices  would  likely  rise \nmildly given that international oil prices were forecasted  by foreign institutions to  go \nmodestly higher than 2023.",

        "Headline inflation \nforecasts by major domestic and foreign institutions ranged between 1.50% and 2.50% \nfor year 2024.",
        "Key  factors  affecting  the  future  path  of  domestic  prices  this  year  include  the \nfollowing.",
        "Upside pressures could arise from (1) elevated fruit prices, as supply declines \nowing to the lagged effect of last year’s typhoons and torrential rain; (2) a food price \nuptrend, including food away from home and meat; (3) higher rent; (4) hikes in prices \nof  hotel  stays  and  group  travel  fees  in  response  to  strong  demand  among  domestic \nconsumers  for  leisure  and  entertainment  services;  (5)  a  universal  hike  in  domestic \nelectricity  tariffs  this  year.",
        "On  the  other  hand,  downside  pressures  could  come  from \nreductions in prices of mobile phones and other communication devices.",
        "The inflation rate is expected to gradually come down quarter by quarter this year; \nfor the year as a whole, the inflation rate would register lower than last year.",
        "However, as inflation has been relatively elevated since 2021 and the electricity tariff \nhike is to take effect in April, they could fuel higher inflation expectations.",
        "The annual growth rate of the CPI was 1.97% in 2021, 2.95% in 2022, and 2.49% \nin 2023 and is projected by the Bank to be 2.16% in 2024.",

        "Related \ndiscussions are summarized as follows.",
        "One board member supported a rate hike by 0.125 percentage points.",
        "The member \nnoted that inflation expectation is one of the vital considerations in monetary \npolicymaking,  and  strongly  entrenched  inflation  expectations  are  difficult  to  contain.",
        "Given that Taiwan’s CPI annual growth rate has come close to or exceeded 2% for four \nconsecutive years, the inflation expectation problem should be heeded.",
        "In particular, the \nscheduled  April  electricity  tariff  hike  could  induce  a  new  wave  of  upward  price \nadjustments among businesses and stoke inflation expectations.",
        "Since not talking about \nit does not make the problem nonexistent, there needs to be countermeasures to rein it \nin.",
        "A  0.125  percentage  point  rate  hike  would  have  an  announcement  effect  that \ndemonstrates  the  Bank  takes  the  inflation  issue  very  seriously.",
        "Going  forward,  if \ninflation is still elevated, there is a possibility of further rate hikes to fulfill the Bank’s \noverarching mission of and unwavering efforts in maintaining price stability.",
        "One  board  member  pointed  out  that  Taiwan’s  GDP  growth  was  estimated  to \nadvance  at  a  solid  pace  this  year,  whereas  price  rises  in  food  away  from  home  and \nhousing  rent  remained  unabated.",
        "Adding  in  the  effect  of  the  coming  electricity  tariff \nhike, Taiwan’s annual  CPI inflation rate could exceed 2% for the third  year in a row.",
        "Against  this  backdrop,  raising  the  policy  rates  by  0.125  percentage  points  would  not \nonly  show  the  Bank  was  taking  the  inflation  issue  seriously  but  also  demonstrate  the \nintention  to  contain  inflation  expectations.",
        "Therefore,  the  member  concurred  with  the \nrate  hike  proposition.",
        "Another  board  member  also  supported  the  proposition,  stating \nthat,  given  how  conscious  the  general  public  could  be  of  price  increases,  a  rate  hike \npolicy would be a good move if it helps tame price upswings.",
        "One board member noted that Taiwan’s labor market conditions remained stable, \nbut the real total earnings of payroll employees posted negative growth last year for the \nfirst time in seven years, an issue attributable to elevated inflation.",
        "In the fight against \ninflation, rent and food-away-from-home prices were still rising.",
        "Given the downward \nprice stickiness of rent, if housing prices continue climbing and push up rent along the \nway, it would pose  an  even greater  challenge for price stability.",
        "Likewise, downward \nprice stickiness  of  food away from home  also warrants attention as its annual growth \nrate has stayed elevated, and a faster hike in food-away-from-home prices could make \nit harder for inflation pressures to ease anytime soon.",
        "Therefore, raising the policy rates \nby 0.125 percentage points would be a good move because it shows the Bank’s stance \non mitigating upside pressures on prices.",
        "Meanwhile, the Bank still needs to keep close \nwatch on the issue of persistent inflation.",
        "Another board director stated that Taiwan’s annual CPI growth rate has remained \nabove 2% for some time, mainly owing to price rises in food away from home and rent.",
        "The CPI annual growth rate of food away from home has gone above 4% every month \nsince  February  2022,  except  for  February  2023.",
        "The  longer  the  uptrend  persists,  the \nworse it is for public inflation expectations.",
        "Meanwhile, the CPI annual growth rate of \nrent continued to exceed 2% every month since July 2022, and higher retail store rent \ncosts could feed into food-away-from-home prices.",
        "However, considering that a larger \npolicy  rate  hike  could  cause  property  owners  to  pass  the  additional  interest  burden \nthrough to tenants and thus push up rent, the proposed hike by 0.125 percentage points \nseemed appropriate.",
        "One board director pointed out that Taiwan’s real interest rate would be negative \nwhen  subtracting  the  CPI  inflation  rate  from  the  nominal  policy  rate,  indicating  that \nthere remains room for policy rate hikes.",
        "In the past, changes to oil or electricity rates \nwere  hardly  reflected  in  the  CPI  readings;  it  is  necessary  to  start  taking  them  into \naccount, with close attention to be paid to their potential effects on inflation expectations \nas  they  could  in  turn  affect  actual  inflation.",
        "Given  that  a  rate  hike  would  help  keep \ninflation expectations anchored, the member showed support to the proposition of hiking \nthe policy rates by 0.125 percentage points.",
        "One board director observed that, with the policy rates kept unchanged since it was \nlast raised by 0.125 percentage points in March 2023, the fact that the 2023 annual CPI \ngrowth rate remained high could somehow indicate insufficient monetary tightening had \nled  to  persistently  elevated  inflation.",
        "On  top  of  that,  the  coming  electricity  tariff  hike \ncould  further  fuel  public  inflation  expectations  in  2024.",
        "Moreover,  unlike  major \neconomies, Taiwan has a negative real interest rate.",
        "Therefore, while a policy rate hike \nis the right move amid solid economic growth and stable labor market conditions, a 0.25 \npercentage point hike should be the appropriate pace of tightening in line with what is \ncommonly adopted among central banks.",
        "Still, the member agreed with today’s 0.125 \npercentage point rate hike proposition.",
        "One board member gave the opinion that while deposit rates at banks usually track \ncentral bank policy rate changes, the pace of banks’ adjustments varies across countries.",
        "Given the importance of deposit rates to households, the member suggested looking at \nthe real interest rate from the perspective of depositors.",
        "Take the average inflation rate \nof the past twelve months (March 2022 to February 2023) and the one-year deposit rate, \nwith today’s proposed rate hike dismissed, then a cross-country comparison would show \nthat  the  real  interest  rates  were  negative  in  not  only  Taiwan,  but  also  the  US, \nSwitzerland, Hong Kong, the euro area, the UK, Singapore, and Japan, with the level of \nTaiwan’s real interest rate higher than the aforementioned economies.",
        "And after today’s \n0.125 percentage point policy rate hike, combined with the projected slowdown in the \ndomestic inflation rate, Taiwan’s real interest rate is expected to move toward positive \nterritory.",
        "One  board  director  stated  that  Taiwan  is  currently  facing  greater  price-related \npressures  than  many  other  economies,  mainly  because  of  relatively  smaller  price \nincreases  in  oil  and  electricity  rates  in  the  past.",
        "In  spite  of  tax  policy  actions  by  the \nMinistry of Finance to help keep prices steady, Taiwan Power Company and the CPC \nCorp. had been struggling with heavy losses.",
        "According to several domestic institutions, \na 10% hike on average in the electricity tariff would push the 2024 CPI annual growth \nrate to 2.2%-2.4%.",
        "The member thus supported the 0.125 percentage point rate hike as \na preemptive move.",
        "Although the size of the hike alone may not bring the inflation rate \nback  down  to  below  2%,  it  would  help  lower  public  inflation  expectations  and \ndemonstrate the Bank’s resolution in combating inflation through monetary tightening \nat a time when Taiwan is under inflationary pressures.",
        "One  board  member  remarked  on  recent  developments  in  different  economic \nsectors.",
        "The services sector grew at a steady pace and exports continued expanding, with \nrobust  growth  in  exports  of  chips  and  servers  in  the  AI-related  supply  chain;  but  this \nwas not the case for every industry.",
        "For instance, exports of non-AI servers and mobile \nphones  were  tepid.",
        "This  indicated  a growing polarizing in Taiwan’s manufacturing \nsector.",
        "With the looming electricity tariff hike already set to push up production costs, \na policy rate hike would also increase funding costs and could cause more hardship for \nthese  companies.",
        "Therefore,  it  would  not  be  appropriate  to  raise  the  policy  rates  in \ntoday’s meeting.",
        "One  board  member,  in  support  of  the  rate  hike  proposition,  stated  that  ICT/AV \nexport growth in the Jan.-Feb. period increased twice as fast year on year on the back of \nemerging  tech  applications  such  as  AI,  whereas  other  products  recorded  negative \ngrowth.",
        "Furthermore, today’s rate hike was primarily aimed at containing domestic \ninflation  expectations,  but  there  is  a  possibility  of  creating  a  dilemma  it  adversely \nimpacts some sectors in the process.",
        "Another  board  director  pointed  out  that  the  direct  and  indirect  effects  of  an \nelectricity tariff hike might not be sizeable, but inflation expectations could gather steam \nand would not be easy to contain once they take off.",
        "Meanwhile, a rate hike increases \nfunding costs, likely hindering corporate investment, exports, and private consumption.",
        "Considering that domestic economic growth picked up pace but was not  yet heated to \nthe extent of requiring aggressive rate hikes to rein it in, the member viewed that smaller \nrate hikes at the current juncture would probably pack a minor punch while still making \nan announcement effect to show that the Bank is committed to combating inflation if \nthe inflation rate cannot meaningfully come down to the low level  of around 1% as it \nhas  been.",
        "Therefore,  the  member  supported  a  rate  hike  by  0.125  percentage  points.",
        "Furthermore, given the US dollar strength and the resultant NTD-USD depreciation in \nthe  year  to  date,  a  small  rate  hike  would  somewhat  relieve  the  pressure  on  the  NTD \nexchange rate.",
        "Another board director, also supporting the rate hike proposition, pointed out that \nthe Bank’s forecasts for this year’s CPI and core CPI annual  growth  rates  were  both \nhigher than the previous forecasts when the Board last met in December 2023.",
        "In respect \nof the electricity tariff hike, it would not only have a direct impact but also create a chain \nreaction by pushing up costs across business sectors; for example, electricity-intensive \nindustries  could  pass  the  increased  bill  costs  to  consumers.",
        "Meanwhile,  the  domestic \neconomy was expected to post steady growth this year as forecasted by the Bank, and \nthe unemployment rate continued trending down in January, hitting the lowest monthly \nrecord in 24 years.",
        "Against this backdrop, raising the policy rates would help promote \nprice stability without hampering economic growth.",
        "Another board director supported the 0.125 percentage point hike and remarked on \nthe inflation rate.",
        "According to the Bank’s 2024 quarterly forecast values, Taiwan’s \nannual CPI growth rate would exceed 2% during the first two quarters of the year before \ncoming down to slightly below 2% in the third and fourth quarters, albeit all close to the \nBank’s mid-term monitoring range of 0%-2%.",
        "The Bank would still need to keep a close \neye on the outlook and forecasts of inflation.",
        "The board directors decided to raise the discount rate, the rate on refinancing of \nsecured loans, and the rate on temporary accommodations by 0.125 percentage \npoints to 2%, 2.375%, and 4.25%, respectively.",
        "Since the  Board  met in December  last  year, the global  manufacturing and services \nsectors  have  witnessed  faster  growth,  and  trade  activity  has  gradually  recovered.",
        "Nevertheless, major central banks in the US and Europe have maintained high policy \nrates, which have continued to restrain global economic growth momentum.",
        "Inflation \nrates  in  major  economies  have  come  down  at  a  slower  pace  as  services  inflation \nremains elevated.",
        "International institutions projected the world economy to \nexperience  slightly  milder  growth  than  last  year  and  the  inflation  rate  to  decline \nfurther this year.",
        "While central banks in the US and Europe held policy rates steady from the second \nhalf  of  2023  onwards,  the  BoJ  moved  towards  monetary  policy  normalization  this \nweek  with  a  rate  hike  and  unwinding  of  its  negative  interest  rate  and  yield  curve \ncontrol  policies,  yet  still  maintaining  an  accommodative  monetary  policy  stance.",
        "Market investors expect that the US and European central banks would pivot to rate \ncuts, whereas the BoJ would likely raise policy rates again.",
        "Market attention to major \ncentral banks' monetary policy moves has induced greater volatility in international \nfinancial markets.",
        "Looking ahead, the global economic and financial outlooks are still shrouded in many \nuncertainties, such as the timing for the US and European central banks to adjust their \nmonetary  tightening  stance,  developments  in  Japan's  monetary  policy,  spillover \neffects  of  China's  economic  slowdown,  and  global  economic  fragmentation  and \nsupply chain restructuring.",

        "In recent months, Taiwan's exports recorded continuous growth, under pinned \nby stabilizing global final demand and booming business for artificial \nintelligence and other emerging technology applications.",
        "In regard to \ndomestic  demand,  private  consumption  gained  momentum  from  stronger \nconsumer confidence amid an economic reco very, whereas investment \nsentiment  remained  lackluster  as  reflected  by  a  sustained  contraction  in \ncapital  equipment  imports.",
        "In  the  labor  market,  the  number  of  employed \npersons continued increasing in recent months, the unemployment rate \ndropped further, and the number of furloughed workers also decreased.",
        "For the  year as a whole, the prospects  of global  goods trade  growth firming \nup  and  emerging  tech  applications  gaining  traction  would  likely  fuel  export \ngrowth  and  bolster  private  investment.",
        "Meanwhile,  private  consumption  is \nexpected  to  continue  growing.",
        "The  Bank  therefore  slightly  upgraded  the \nforecast for Taiwan's 2024 GDP growth rate to 3.22% (see Appendix Table 1 \nfor the forecasts by major institutions), which was higher than 1.31% in 2023 .",
        "For the first two months of the year, the annual growth rate of the consumer \nprice  index  (CPI)  averaged  2.43%,  mainly  reflecting  increases  in  prices  of \nfood (particularly fruit and food away from home) and entertainment services \nand rising housing rent.",
        "The core CPI (excluding vegetables, fruit, and energy \nitems) continued slowing down gradually, with an average annual growth rate \nof 2.27% during the same period.",
        "For  the  outlook  of  this  year,  the  CPI  inflation  rate  would  likely  slow  down \nfrom  last  year  given  a  mild  rise  in  commodity  prices,  as  international  oil \nprices were  projected  by international institutions  to  edge up  from  the \nprevious year, and a smaller increase in services prices owing to a high base \neffect.",
        "Taking  into  account  a  proposed  hike  in  electrici ty  rates  in  April  this \nyear,  the  Bank  revised  up  the  forecasts  for  the  CPI  and  core  CPI  inflation \nrates this year to 2.16% and 2.03%, respectively, lower than 2.49% and 2.58% \nlast year (see Appendix Table 2 for the forecasts by major institutions).",
        "Domestic  market  liquidity  was  ample  and  short  and  long -term  market  rates \nfluctuated  within a narrow range in  recent  months.",

        "The Board decided to raise the policy rates by 0.125 percentage points \nAt the meeting today, the Board considered the balance of incoming data on \neconomic and financial conditions at home and abroad.",
        "The domestic \ninflation rate was expected to slowly come down quarter by quarter this year.",
        "However,  given  that  inflation  has  stayed  at  a  relatively  higher  level  since \n2021 and that a proposed electricity rate hike  might be implemented in April \nthis year, inflation expectations might shift upwards.",
        "Meanwhile, the \neconomic growth would likely pick up this year.",
        "Against this background, in \norder to contain domestic inflation expectations, the Board judged that a rate \nhike  would  help  sustain  price  stability  and  foster  sound  economic  and \nfinancial development on the whole.",
        "The  Board  decided  to  raise  the  discount  rate,  the  rate  on  refinancing  of \nsecured loans, and the rate on temporary accommodations by 0.125 \npercentage  points to  2%, 2.375%,  and 4.25%, respectively, effective  March \n22, 2024.",
        "Going  forward,  the  Bank  will  remain  watchful  of  the  evolving  effects  of \nelectricity  rate  adjustments  and  energy  transition  for  net -zero  emissions  on \ndomestic inflation.",
        "The Bank will also stay attentive to incoming information \nregarding  monetary  policy  paths  of  major  central  banks,  risks  from  China's \neconomic  downturn,  international  raw  material  prices,  geopolitical  risks, \nextreme  weather,  etc.",
        "The  Bank  will  assess  their  implication s  for  domestic \neconomic activity and financial conditions and adjust its monetary policy in \na timely manner as warranted, so as to fulfill the statutory duties of \nmaintaining financial and price stability and fostering economic development \nwithin the scope of the aforementioned objectives.",
        "The Bank has made five amendments to its selective credit control measures since \nDecember  2020,  which  have  helped  enhance  banks'  risk  management  associated \nwith real estate lending and curb an excessive flow of credit resources into the real \nestate market.",
        "In addition, the Bank's gradual approach to monetary tightening since \nMarch  2022  has  also  helped  reinforce  the  effectiveness  of  the  selective  credit \ncontrol  measures.",
        "As  a  result,  data  since  the  introduction  of  the  selective  credit \ncontrols have shown that growth in construction loans of all banks has continued \nslowing  and  credit  quality  of  real  estate  lending  remains  sound  as  the  non-\nperforming loan ratio stays low.",
        "Nevertheless,  growth  in  housing  loans  as  well  as  loans  to  the  real  estate \nsector  has  picked  up  as  housing  market  transactions  resurged,  and  the  ratio \nof real estate lending to total lending of all banks remains elevated.",
        "Therefore, \nthe Bank will continue reviewing the status of banks' real estate lending and \nthe  effectiveness  of  the  selective  credit  controls,  closely  monitor  potential \nimpacts  of  real  estate  sector-related  policies  on  the  housing  market,  and  adjust relevant measures as needed in order to promote financial stability and \nsound banking operations.",

        "The export decline \nalso  caused  private  investment  to  constrict.",
        "By  contrast,  after  the  pandemic  concerns \nreceded, pent-up demand was released briskly, sending private consumption growth to \na  33-year  high  in  the  second  quarter  of  2023.",
        "Both  retail  and  food/beverage  sectors \nwitnessed  the  strongest  sales  in  history  during  the  Jan.-Jul.",
        "period,  reflecting  robust \nconsumer spending and revealing Taiwan’s “cold out, warm within” economic situation.",
        "Provided that domestic inflation softens steadily, a rate hold would be in favor so that \ndomestic  demand  sectors  (consumption,  investment,  etc.)",
        "would  not  be  thwarted  by \nhigher interest rates.",
        "One board director noted that exports’ vital role in the economy makes Taiwan \nclosely interconnected with, and susceptible to, the world economy.",
        "The\nunderperformance of Taiwan’s exports this year mainly resulted from two factors: (1) \nA pullback from pandemic-era upsurges, and (2) the US-China confrontation, as well as \na disappointing Chinese economic recovery.",
        "At present, the anticipated upgrade across \nthe AI supply chain would likely propel export growth, whereas other products remained \nstymied by sluggish global demand.",
        "Overall, in the fourth quarter this  year, Taiwan’s \nexports  would  perform  better  than  the  third  quarter,  with  broad  expectations  of  a \nremarkable  upturn  next  year.",
        "As  for  domestic  demand,  a  wide  range  of  consumption \nindustries  enjoyed  record  high  growth,  but  still  some  others  were  cramped  by  labor \nshortage.",
        "Considering  that with the exception of a certain electronics industries,  most \nsectors were still struggling, a rate hike would not be an appropriate move.",
        "One board director stated the current domestic downturn was partly due to a higher \nbase effect arising from robust economic growth in the past three  years,  while  global \ninflation also took its toll on our economy.",
        "As international forecasts put the 2023-2027 \naverage inflation rate of the world at still high levels, leading to a new normal of elevated \nprices,  Taiwan’s  exports  would  therefore  be  markedly  hindered under the \ncircumstances.",
        "Meanwhile, despite the current steady growth in domestic demand, once \nthe policy rates are raised, mortgage borrowers’ interest burden would increase, causing \nhouseholds  to  cut  spending  and  thereby  denting  domestic  demand  momentum.",
        "In \naddition,  a  rate  hike  now  would  have  only  modest  effects  on  future  price  trends.",
        "Therefore, the director was in favor of keeping the policy rates steady.",
        "One board director pointed out that the index of import prices was trending down, \nconducive to domestic price stability.",
        "In August 2023, the annual growth rate of the CPI \nwent up; meanwhile, the core CPI recorded a lower annual growth rate, but the Bank’s \ninternal research showed that leading indicators for the core CPI were on the rise, which \ncalled for attention.",
        "In addition, despite some signs of cooling in housing transactions \nand slower price rises, the uptrend in housing prices still continued; given that residential \nrent serves as a lagging indicator of housing prices and has a significant weighting in \nthe CPI basket, rises in rent could in turn drive up overall prices.",
        "In the meantime, the \nannual growth rates of the commodities or services whose price changes consumers are \nmore conscious of were still high,  which could buoy up public inflation expectations.",
        "On  the  other  hand,  the  Bank  made  another  downgrade  to  its  2023  GDP  growth  rate \nforecast and estimated that the output gap would remain negative this year.",
        "Since current \neconomic  readings  were  divergent,  the  director  approved  of  a  rate  hold  for  the  time \nbeing, and noted that continued  monitoring was warranted  for another quarter, with  a \npossibility of having to proactively address the issue of inflation.",
        "One board director discussed domestic economic fundamentals.",
        "Regarding export \ngrowth,  although  there  were  signs  of  recovery  after  a  series  of  declines  for  12 \nconsecutive  months,  it  was  not  rebounding  forcefully  and  order  visibility  was  low.",
        "Meanwhile, private consumption continued on the growth path but at a slower pace, and \nprivate investment just recorded the sixth consecutive month of negative growth, with \nfirms  wary  of  making  investment  plans.",
        "As  for  prices,  temporary  factors  caused  the \nannual CPI growth rate to exceed 2% again in August; and the overall price trend, though \nheading downwards, still called for continuous monitoring.",
        "In sum, the director was in \nfavor of a rate hold.",
        "Another board director pointed out that the actual value of Taiwan’s \ncurrent unemployment rate was similar to the natural unemployment rate estimated by \nthe Bank, indicating the policy rates were currently at appropriate levels.",
        "Therefore, a \nrate hold would be the proper move in today’s Meeting.",
        "One  board  director  stated  the  importance  of  heeding  the  possible  impact  of  the \nupcoming electricity tariff hike on the prices in the services sector.",
        "In addition, the hiring \nbottleneck also warranted special attention as continued labor shortage in services and \nconstruction industries pushed up wage and related prices, carrying adverse implications \nfor inflation.",
        "Another board director noted that the import price index in US dollar terms dropped \nin the Jan.-Aug. period; in NT dollar terms, the index also fell despite NTD weakness \nvis-à-vis  the  USD.",
        "The  producer  price  index  also  decreased,  another  sign  of  easing \ninflationary pressures.",
        "Regarding the influence of international oil prices on domestic \ninflation, despite the recent uptrend, it was still expected that for the year as a whole, oil \nprices  would  on  average  exert  downward  pressures  on  the  domestic  inflation  rate \ncompared to last year.",
        "As for the upcoming power tariff hike partially imposed on some \ndomestically-oriented  industries  from  October  onwards,  the  Bank  estimated  it  would \nhave a limited impact on this year’s inflation rate.",
        "Looking  at  economic  growth,  the \nforecasted underperformance this year was attributable to the global economic malaise \ncausing  Taiwan’s  exports  and,  in  turn,  private  investment  to  both  record  negative \ngrowth.",
        "All in all, these developments in prices and economic growth warranted a policy \nrate  hold  at  the  current  juncture.",
        "Nevertheless,  uncertainties  still  abounded  for  price \ntrends and economic activity; in the future, the Board could still consider adjusting the \npolicy rates if deemed necessary.",
        "One board director stated that monetary policy-making needs to take into account \npublic perception of prices.",
        "In particular, goods purchased at least once per month and \nthe top 17 staple goods in the CPI basket both registered annual growth rates higher than \nthat of the overall CPI; the annual growth rate of the core CPI also rose faster than the \noverall CPI.",
        "Regarding the CPI for rent, it climbed back up in August from a  modest \ndownswing earlier.",
        "For the first eight months of the year, the annual CPI growth rate for \nrent came higher than last year, while that for entertainment services was elevated; given \nthat housing rent and prices of services tend to exhibit downward price stickiness, the \nfuture path of these categories warrant continuous monitoring.",
        "The director expressed \nsupport for a rate hold today, but noted that by the time the next quarterly Board Meeting \nis  convened,  the  Bank  should  pay  special  attention  to  price  uptrends  and  to  whether \nconsumer  sentiment  about  prices  would  step  up  inflation  expectations  and  create  an \nimpact on price stability.",
        "Should there be renewed signs of prices firming up, the Bank \nwould probably need to take stronger initiative to clamp down inflation.",
        "One board director pointed to tepid exports and private investment and cautioned \nthat these sectors  remained  mired in negative growth despite some  signs of recovery.",
        "The Bank’s downgrade of its forecast for Taiwan’s 2023 GDP growth rate implied still \nlukewarm  growth  momentum  for  the  domestic  economy.",
        "With  the  world,  especially \nChina, still facing downside risks to the economy, Taiwan’s export growth and future \neconomic  recovery  could  be  constrained.",
        "On  the  other  hand,  the  price  trends  in  the \nintermeeting period were similar to those considered for the previous Board Meeting, \nand it was forecasted that the inflation and core inflation rates would be lower this year \nthan last year and would likely ease to below 2% next year.",
        "In terms of economic growth, \ndespite the aforementioned forecast downgrade for this  year, growth was projected to \naccelerate next year.",
        "These showed that relevant policy efforts to rein in inflation and to \nreinvigorate  the  economy  had  been  effective  and  hence  it  would  be  right  to  continue \nforward  on  the  same  path.",
        "The  director  therefore  supported  the  decision  to  keep  the \npolicy rates steady.",
        "One board director noted Taiwan’s economy was slackening, particularly pointing \nout how worrying the slowdown was in exports and private investment, the two driving \nforces behind Taiwan’s economic growth.",
        "On the other hand, the domestic inflationary \npressure were diminishing and the inflation rate was expected to decline to below 2% \nnext  year.",
        "After considering for the Bank’s mandate of price stability and economic \ngrowth, the director saw little reason for either a rate hike or a rate cut and stated that a \nrate hold would be the sensible decision.",
        "The board directors decided unanimously to keep the discount rate, the rate on \nrefinancing  of  secured  loans,  and  the  rate  on  temporary  accommodations \nunchanged at 1.875%, 2.25%, and 4.125%, respectively.",
        "Since  the  Board  met  in  June  this  year,  the  cumulative  effects  of  significant \npolicy  rate  hikes  by  major  central  banks  in  the  US  and  Europe  since  2022 \nhave continued to work through the economy.",
        "Growth in the global \nmanufacturing sector has remained tepid, while services activity has turned \nweaker.",
        "There  has  been  a  divergence  in  economic  growth  across  major \neconomies.",
        "The US economy has exhibited solid expansion, whereas the euro \narea and the UK have registered anemic economic growt h. Japan's economy \nhas grown mildly, yet China has faced rising downside economic risks.",
        "With \nregard to inflation trends, commodity prices have declined as global demand \nsoftened, whereas services prices have remained stubbornly high because of \ndownward price stickiness, leading global inflation to trend down at a slow \npace.",
        "In  recent  months,  considering  still  elevated  inflation  rates,  some  central \nbanks continued their rate hike paths, while other central banks kept policy \nrates  on  hold.",
        "As  inflationary  pr essures  linger  in  major  economies,  high \ninterest  rates  may  sustain  for  some  time.",
        "It  is  thus  expected  that  the  world \neconomic  and  trade  growth  momentum  would  remain  subdued.",
        "In  recent \nmonths,  global  financial  markets  fluctuated  as  investor  expectations  on  US \nand European monetary policy paths shifted.",
        "The US dollar index rebounded \nand major currencies broadly depreciated against the US dollar.",
        "Looking ahead, the global economic and financial outlooks are clouded by multiple \nuncertainties, such as the cumulative effects of monetary tightening by major central \nbanks and the duration of interest rates staying high,  China's economic  slowdown, \nand fragmentation of the global economy, which could all restrain the momentum for \nglobal economic recovery.",
        "International institutions projected the world \neconomy to grow at a moderate pace and the inflation rate to drop further in \n2024.",
        "Nevertheless,  geopolitical  risks  and  climate  change  may  affect  the \nsupply of commodities, and the global inflation trends remain uncertain .",
        "In  the  months  since  midyear,  the  decline  in  Taiwan's  export  growth  has \nslowed as continued sluggishness in global final demand was somewhat offset \nby  stronger  export  momentum  of  information  communication  technol ogy \nproducts to meet demand for emerging technology applications and by \nnarrower  contractions  in  traditional  sector  exports.",
        "In  respect  of  domestic \ndemand,  corporate  investment  willingness  remained  muted,  with  imports  of \ncapital  equipment  still  mired  in  do uble-digit  negative  growth.",
        "In  contrast, \nprivate  consumption  rose  steadily on  the  back  of  strong post -pandemic \ndemand  for  dining  and  tourism.",
        "For  the  second  half  of  the  year,  the  Bank \nprojected  the  GDP  growth  rate  to  rebound  to  3.81%  on  account  of  a  lower \nbase  effect.",
        "The  Bank's  GDP  growth  forecast  for  the  year  as  a  whole  was \n1.46% (see Appendix Table  1 for the forecasts  by  major institutions),  lower \nthan the June forecast of 1.72%.",
        "Regarding labor market conditions in recent \nmonths, job gains continued, the unemployment rate came lower than a year \nago, and nominal wage increased mildly.",
        "For  the  outlook  of  next year,  it  was  expected  that  exports  and  private \ninvestment  would  gather  pace  amid  a  pickup  in  global  goods  trade  growth \nand further development in e merging technology applications.",
        "Private \nconsumption would also continue expanding next year thanks to the planned \nminimal  wage  hike  and  public  sector  pay  raise,  albeit  with  slower  year -on-\nyear  growth  than  2023  owing  to  a  higher  base  effect.",
        "The  Bank  expec ted \nTaiwan's economy to grow by 3.08% in 2024.",
        "In  the  months  from  June  onwards,  the  annual  growth  rate  of  the  consumer \nprice index (CPI) rebounded after dipping, mainly reflecting changes in fruit, \nvegetables, and oil prices, while the annual growth rate  of the core CPI (i.e., \nexcluding fruit, vegetables, and energy items) edged down.",
        "For the first eight \nmonths  of  the  year,  the  headline  inflation  rate  averaged  2.29%  and  the  core \ninflation rate averaged 2.66%.",
        "According to the Bank's projections, inflation  \nwould trend slightly lower in the second half of the year than in the first.",
        "For \nthis  year  as  a  whole,  the  annual  growth  rate  of  the  CPI  and  that  of  the  core \nCPI were forecasted to register 2.22% and 2.44%, respectively (see Appendix \nTable 2 for the forecasts by major institutions), lower than the 2022 readings \nof 2.95% and 2.61%.",
        "Indeed, domestic inflation came down slowly in the year \nso  far,  mainly  because  a  gradual  moderation  in  commodity  inflation  amid \nfaltering  import  and  production  price  trends  was  c ounteracted  by  elevated \nservices  inflation  owing  to  robust  post -pandemic  demand  for  entertainment \nservices.",
        "In regard to the price trends next year, it was expected that, despite a modest \nrebound  in  international  oil  prices,  softer  domestic  services  infla tion  would \nbring  Taiwan's  inflation  rate  lower  than  this  year.",
        "The  Bank  forecasted  the \nheadline and core inflation rates to further slow down to 1.83% and 1.73% in \n2024, noting that the future path of domestic inflation could still be affected \nby factors including the price trends of international commodities and \ndomestic services, as well as weather -related disruptions.",
        "Domestic  market  liquidity  was  ample  and  short  and  long -term  market  rates \nfluctuated  within  a  small  range  in  recent  months.",

        "The Board decided unanimously to keep the policy rates on hold   \nWhile taking into account the aforementioned economic and financial \nconditions  at  home  and  abroad,  the  Board  also  considered  the  following: \nDomestic  inflation  is  softening  gradually  and  the  inflation  rate  is  expected \nto  come  down  to  below  2%  next  year.",
        "Fur thermore,  the  domestic  economy \nwould likely expand at a slower -than-expected pace this year and the output \ngap is estimated to be negative for both this and next year.",

        "Going  forward,  in  view  of  downside  risks  to  the  global  economy  and  the \npersistence  of  inflationary  pressures,  the  Bank  will  stay  attentive  to  the \ndevelopments including the spillover effects of monetary tightening by major \neconomies, signs of steepening in China's economic sl owdown, international  \nraw  material  price  changes,  geopolitical  risks,  and  extreme  weather  events.",
        "The Bank will assess their implications for domestic economic activity  and \nfinancial  conditions  and  adjust  its  monetary  policy  in  a  timely  manner  as \nwarranted,  so  as  to  fulfill  the  statutory  duties  of  maintaining  financial  and \nprice  stability  and  fostering  economic  development  within  the  scope  of  the \nabove objectives.",
        "The Bank has made five amendments to its selective credit control measures since \nDecember 2020 to help enhance bank management of real estate credit risk and curb \nan  excessive  flow  of  credit  resources  into  the  real  estate  market.",
        "The  Bank's \ntightening of the policy rates and the reserve requirement ratios since March 2022 \nhave  further  strengthened  the  effectiveness  of  the  selective  credit  controls.",
        "In  the \nyear to date, growth in construction loans and housing loans have both slowed and \nthe non-performing loan ratio of real estate lending has stayed low, indicating good \ncredit quality.",
        "As government agencies carry on with their policy efforts under the \nHealthy Real Estate Market Plan and improve relevant mechanisms and measures, \nhousing transactions and the price uptrend have both eased so far this year, with more \npolicy effects expected to show successively.",
        "Going forward, the Bank will \ncontinuously monitor the developments in housing credit and the real estate market \nand  the  implementation  results  of  the  selective  credit  control  measures,  and  will \nmake  adjustments  as  needed  in  order  to  promote  financial  stability  and  sound \nbanking operations.",

        "Nonetheless, when irregular factors (such as massive inflows or outflows of short-\nterm capital) and seasonal factors lead to excess volatility or disorderly movements \nin the NT dollar exchange rate with adverse implications for economic and financial \nstability, the Bank, in accordance with its statutory mandates, will step in to maintain \nan orderly market.",
        "Developments  since  the  Board  met  in  December  2022  pointed  to  tepid  growth \nmomentum  in  advanced  economies,  while  policy  rates  could  stay  high  for  some  time \nowing to elevated inflationary pressures.",
        "It was therefore expected that global economic \ngrowth momentum would remain sluggish in 2023.",
        "With global goods demand cooling off, the European energy crunch thawing on a \nwarm  winter,  and  China  lifting  pandemic  lockdown  measures,  concerns  about  goods \nsupply disruptions also eased, global supply chain pressures fell to pre-pandemic levels \nand container freight rates dropped significantly.",

        "With respect to global inflation, it was expected to soften this year as a result of the \neffects from monetary tightening by major economies, global consumer demand cooling \noff, and international energy prices trending down.",
        "Nevertheless, major economies were \nstill confronted by inflationary pressures from rising production costs and further wage \ngrowth.",
        "Regarding  monetary policy  in the  year so far,  most economies, including the \nUS  and  Europe,  continued  to  raise  policy  rates  whereas  some  central  banks  began  to \nslow or pause the pace of rate hikes based on considerations of economic prospects and \nin order to assess the effects of previous rate increases.",
        "Recently, failures or financial distresses of some banks in the US and Europe had \nroiled  international  financial  markets.",
        "Consequently,  most  major  stock  markets  dived \nfrom recent highs, US government bond yields recorded volatile swings, and the VIX \n“fear index” climbed steeply.",
        "Looking  ahead,  the  global  economy  faces  a  myriad  of  uncertainties,  mainly \nincluding:  (1)  the  pace  of  inflation  cool-down  in  major  economies;  (2)  the  path  of \nmonetary  tightening  by  US  and  European  central  banks  and  the  spillover  effects \ntherefrom; (3) China’s economic recovery; (4) uncertainties over commodities supply \nheightened by intensifying climate change, and geopolitical risks also escalating, which \ncould all push up inflation.",

        "For the  year as a whole, the Bank expected exports to grow at a  languid \npace owing to continued tightening by major central banks and weak global economic \nand trade growth momentum.",
        "While the first half of the year would still witness export \ncontraction,  a  gradual  rebound  was  projected  for  the  second  half  of  the  year,  when \nexports  would  resume  positive  growth  thanks  to  reduced  inventory  levels  in  global \nsupply chains.",
        "Private  investment,  whose  growth  has  long  been  highly  correlated  with  exports, \ncould  fare  poorly  this  year;  the  Bank  expected  private  investment  to  show  negative \ngrowth in 2023 in consequence of sluggish export growth, ongoing inventory \nadjustments, and cautious business outlook sentiment.",
        "In terms of private consumption, the easing of pandemic containment measures and \nborder controls would bolster consumer confidence and retail and food/beverage sales; \nthe planned hike in minimum wage and higher income tax-free allowance, as well as the \ngovernment’s  universal  surplus  tax  rebate  program,  would  also  help  sustain  growth \nmomentum.",

        "In  the  labor  market,  business  activity  gradually  picked  up  with  the  domestic \npandemic situation under control, leading the overall unemployment rate to trend lower \nand the number of employed persons to rise higher month by month in the year so far.",
        "However, the number of furloughed manufacturing workers increased as a result of the \nexport slowdown.",
        "Overall, in view of bleak prospects for exports and private investment,  the Bank \ndowngraded the 2023 GDP growth rate forecast to 2.21%, lower than the 2022 growth \nrate of 2.45%.",

        "In  the  second  half  of  the  year, \ndespite still sluggish investment activity, economic growth was expected to rebound (by \n3.84%), with exports gaining traction as a result of global supply chain destocking and \ndomestic demand buttressed by steady private consumption growth and the \ngovernment’s tax  surplus  rebates.",

        "For  the  first \ntwo months of the year, the annual M2 growth rate averaged 6.73%.",
        "In the housing market, recent data showed housing trading cooled down, while real \nestate  lending  continued  to  post  slower  year-on-year  growth,  albeit  with  a  still  high \noutstanding balance.",
        "The Bank’s four rounds of selective credit control measures since \nDecember  2020  have  proved  to  help  strengthen  bank  management  of  credit  risk.",
        "The \nBank’s  monetary  tightening  since  March  2022  have  also  provided  additional \nreinforcement for the credit controls.",
        "More results were expected to show in the future \nas  the  government  continued  to  implement  measures  under  the  Healthy  Real  Estate \nMarket Plan and to develop comprehensive mechanisms and programs as needed.",
        "In  January  and  February  this  year,  the  inflation  rate  fluctuated  more  markedly \nowing to the Lunar New Year holidays.",
        "The average annual growth rate of the consumer \nprice index (CPI) was 2.74% for the first two months of 2023, while the annual growth \nrate  of  the  core  CPI  (excluding  fruit,  vegetables,  and  energy  items)  averaged  2.77%, \nboth extending the moderation since the second half of 2022.",
        "The factors contributing to the 2.74% inflation rate for the Jan.-Feb. period mainly \nincluded rising prices of food  (including food away from home) and of entertainment \nservices and higher housing rent, with a combined contribution of 1.89 percentage points, \nor 69%, to the increase of the inflation rate.",
        "Looking at different categories of the CPI basket, prices of goods declined recently \nwhile prices of services, which tend to be “sticky” (e.g., easy to increase but slow to \ndecrease),  continued  to  trend  upwards.",
        "Meanwhile,  although  staples  with  a  higher \npurchase frequency had seen smaller price rises in the year so far, they still gained more \nmarkedly compared to the overall inflation rate, thereby intensifying consumer \nsentiment of price rises.",
        "In  February,  the  annual  growth  rate  of  the  NT  dollar-denominated  import  price \nindex  came  down  for  the  fifth  month  in  a  row,  while  the  producer  price  index  also \ndropped, indicating that pressures of imported inflation abated.",
        "For the year as a whole, \nit was expected that prices of crude oil and other raw materials would continue to trend \nlower  than  last  year,  and  thus  domestic  inflation  would  likely  cool  down  gradually.",
        "However, as lives began to return to normal after the pandemic waned, entertainment \nprices experienced sharper-than-expected price surges; in addition, worldwide avian flu \npushed up prices of eggs and chicken meat and the domestic electricity tariffs were also \nraised significantly.",
        "In this view, the Bank revised its inflation forecasts to 2.09% for \nboth the inflation and core inflation rates for this year, which were lower than the levels \nof 2022 at 2.95% and 2.61%, respectively.",
        "Projections for Taiwan’s annual CPI growth \nrate made by major domestic and foreign forecasting institutions ranged between 1.36% \nand 2.50%.",
        "Price trends of international commodities and domestic services as well as \nweather events are among the possible factors affecting Taiwan’s inflation this year.",
        "Overall,  in  respect  of  this  year’s domestic price  outlook,  upside  pressures  could \ncome  from  (1)  reinvigorating  demand  for  entertainment  consumption  in  the  post-\npandemic  period;  (2)  stickiness  in  prices  of  services;  (3)  spillover  effects  from  the \nelectricity  tariff  hike;  (4)  higher  food  prices  as  a  result  of  the  avian  flu.",
        "On  the  other \nhand, downside pressures could arise from (1) crude oil and other raw material prices \ndeclining to levels lower than last year; (2) domestic prices of mobile phones and other \ncommunication devices witnessing a further downtrend.",
        "(1) The domestic inflation slowdown was projected to continue, with the annual growth \nrates of CPI and core CPI both forecasted to be 2.09%.",
        "Nevertheless, uncertainties \nstill exist for this outlook.",
        "In addition, the higher-than-usual price rises at home in the \nrecent year could push up inflation expectations.",
        "(2) The global economy is shrouded in many uncertainties.",
        "However, Taiwan’s economy \nwould likely pick up pace in the second half of the year and post mild growth for the \nyear as a whole.",
        "(3) Although recent unsettling troubles in the US and European banking system roiled \nglobal financial markets, the domestic banking system is underpinned by sound \noperations, adequate capital, and ample liquidity, indicating little impact on domestic \nfinancial stability.",
        "Policy Proposition: To raise the discount rate, the rate on refinancing of secured \nloans, and the rate on temporary accommodations by 0.125 percentage points to \n1.875%, 2.25%, and 4.125%, respectively.",
        "Board  members  reached  a  unanimous  decision  to  raise  the  policy  rates  by  0.125 \npercentage points.",
        "Related discussions are summarized as follows.",
        "One board director stated that currently domestic inflation remained elevated and \nthe forecast was upgraded to above 2%, indicating that inflationary pressures still linger.",
        "Additionally,  the  upcoming  power  tariff  hike  in  April  could  add  to  inflationary \npressures.",
        "The  director  therefore  supported  a  rate  increase  to  rein  in  inflation  but \ncontended  that  a  smaller  size  of  increase would be  appropriate considering the \ndowngraded 2023 economic growth forecast, which warranted a hike by 0.125 \npercentage points.",
        "Furthermore, a series of bank failures or distresses that arose in the \nUS  and  Europe  in  March,  albeit  without  imminent  global  financial  systemic  risk, \nresulted  in  high  uncertainties  over  global  financial  conditions.",
        "In  this  view,  the  Bank  \nneeds  to  closely  monitor  the  developments  of  these  events  and  the  stances  of  major \ncentral banks so as to adopt appropriate policy responses as needed.",
        "One board director noted that staple prices continued to face considerable upside \npressures, and energy prices, of which the rising costs had been absorbed by state-owned \noil and electricity enterprises (i.e., the CPC and Taipower), could drive up prices after \nthe  electricity  tariffs  are  hiked  in  April.",
        "Taking  into  account  the  relatively  milder \ninflation in Taiwan compared to major economies, and the slower pace of the Fed’s rate \nhike  by  only  0.25  percentage  points  yesterday  (March  22),  the  director  supported  the \nproposition of raising the policy rates by 0.125 percentage points.",
        "One board director noted the current economic situation was a moderate domestic \neconomy  confronted  by  an  external  cool-down.",
        "Concerning  external  demand,  export \ncontraction in the year to date, which led several research institutions to downgrade their \nforecasts for Taiwan’s 2023 GDP growth rate, was the consequence of US and Europe’s \nmonetary tightening to combat high inflation and exports could therefore remain weak \nat  least  for  the  first  half  of  the  year.",
        "While  taking  into  account  the  continuous  export \ncontraction, the Bank’s monetary policy actions would have a relatively limited impact \non this issue given that waning foreign demand was the culprit.",
        "Meanwhile, domestic \ndemand was still sound in contrast to softening external demand.",
        "Regarding inflation, \nseveral  factors,  including  rising  food-away-from-home  prices  and  housing  rent,  the \ngovernment’s surplus tax rebates, the electricity tariff hike, the post-pandemic services \nrecovery,  and  consumer  perception  of  price  increases,  could  all  further  fuel  inflation \nexpectations.",
        "In view of the current economic down-cycle and negative private \ninvestment  growth  at  home  and  weaker  demand  abroad,  the  domestic  situations  of \naggregate demand and prices were judged to be acceptable; however, a 0.125 percentage \npoint rate hike would be warranted in order to curb inflation expectations.",
        "One  board  director  expressed  the  view  that  Taiwan  remained  under  inflationary \npressures, noting that the inflation rate was coming down but very slowly and the general \npublic tended to perceive inflation as higher.",
        "Therefore, the director supported a 0.125 \npercentage point rate hike in the hope of containing inflation expectations.",
        "With respect \nto  the  domestic  economy,  private  consumption  was  expected  to  post  solid  growth \nwhereas exports and private investment were projected to contract; meanwhile, \nuncertainties surrounding international financial conditions were still high, warranting \nclose  attention.",
        "Therefore,  it  would  be  appropriate  to  raise  the  policy  rates  by  0.125 \npercentage points in today’s meeting.",
        "Another  board  director  remarked  that  the  Bank  should  take  action  to  vigorously \nfight inflation and, in particular, inflation expectations; therefore, the director supported \nthe rate hike proposition.",
        "While nominal regular earnings of all payroll employees in the \nindustrial  and  services  sectors  posted  the  highest  annual  growth  rate  since  2000,  real \nregular earnings (adjusted for inflation) actually slipped to negative growth.",
        "Considering \nthat  continued rises in  nominal wage  might indicate higher inflation expectations and \ncould result in the so-called “second round effects,” it was important to keep watch on \nwhether wage increases would feed into the price uptrend.",
        "In addition, the top 17 staple \nitems in the CPI basket had been rising faster than the overall inflation rate since entering \nthe year, representing more upside pressures for inflation expectations.",
        "At this juncture, \nthe  Bank’s  strong commitment to rein in inflation would help lower inflation \nexpectations.",
        "Furthermore, the average rent increase in the year to date exceeded that of \nlast year; considering a lag in the effect of higher housing prices on rent and  that rent \nrises tend to be sticky and persistent, continuous monitoring would be important.",
        "And \nwhile wealth distribution and income equality are not part of the Bank’s mandate, the \nissue  of  inflation  imposing  greater  hardship  on  low-income  households  still  warrants \nattention.",
        "One  board  director  stated  that  the  forecast  model  showed  that  the  probability  of \nTaiwan entering an economic recession in the next quarter was 20% - 40%; meanwhile, \nlabor market conditions were steady, whereas the CPI and core CPI rates stayed above \n2%.",
        "On the other hand, the bid rate for the certificates of deposit issued by the Bank and \nthe interest rates on commercial paper in the money market both continued to decline, \nindicating sufficient liquidity.",
        "Therefore, the pressing issue of inflation should be given \npriority.",
        "In  this  view,  the  director  supported  a  rate  hike  to  curb  inflation  expectations \nwhile  a  size  of  0.125  percentage  points  would  be  appropriate  given  the  still  high \nuncertainties over international economic and financial conditions.",
        "Furthermore, there \nseemed to be a pattern in the Bank’s monetary policymaking since 2000 where the Bank \nshowed more caution in rate increase decisions; during some of the periods with robust \neconomic  growth  and  low  unemployment,  the  Bank  raised  the  policy  rates  in  small \nincrements of 0.125 percentage points, an approach seldom seen in other central banks \nthat could lead to protracted low interest rates and subject Taiwan to a low-interest-rate \ntrap.",
        "Looking  ahead,  once  the  global  and  domestic  economic  activity  resumes  steady \ngrowth, it would then be appropriate to keep in line with the more common practice of \nother central banks by adjusting the policy rates in increments of 0.25 percentage points.",
        "Another  board  director  noted  that  current  international  financial  conditions  have \nfaced  increasingly  higher  uncertainties  than  before;  a  similar  situation  would  lead  to \ndifferent assessments in different times, hence the difference in the size of policy rate \nadjustments.",
        "For instance, the recent US and European banking turmoil created ripples \nof  financial  instability  to  other  economies.",
        "In  Taiwan,  the  impact  was  relatively  mild \nbecause  domestic  banks  have  a  different  balance  sheet  structure  than  those  in  the  US \nand  Europe.",
        "However,  in  a  global  context,  Taiwan  as  a  small  open  economy  is \nsusceptible  to  international  economic  and  financial  changes,  and  the  impact  of  recent \nevents on international markets, which could also affect the Bank’s future monetary \npolicy path, remains to be seen given the uncertainties.",
        "Since a comparison can hardly \nbe drawn for the size of rate adjustments in different contexts, there would be no telling \nwhether the past or the current rate changes are big or small, an issue that might warrant \ncontemplation in the future.",
        "One board director pointed out that both economic and financial conditions faced \nhigh uncertainties, mainly surrounding the recent bank debacles in the US and Europe, \nwhich  were  generally  judged  to  be  largely  devoid  of  systemic  risk.",
        "Given  the  high \nuncertainties, the director supported a 0.125 percentage point rate increase.",
        "In terms of \ninflation, external estimation put the inflationary effect of the April electricity tariff hike \nat 0.2 percentage points of the CPI annual growth rate.",
        "It should also be noted that the \nreal interest rate, instead of the nominal interest rate, is what monetary policy decisions \ntake  into  consideration,  as  it  plays  a  crucial  role  in  such  activity  as  consumption, \ninvestment, and bank lending.",
        "While a 0.125  percentage point hike today would  help \nbring  the  currently  negative  real  interest  rate  closer  to  positive  territory,  the  fact  that \nTaiwan has registered a negative real interest rate for three consecutive years calls for \nattention to its effect on the domestic economic and financial conditions.",
        "One  board  director  was  in  favor  of  raising  the  policy  rates  by  0.125  percentage \npoints, citing the importance of continued rate increases to affirm the Bank’s inflation-\nfighting commitment given the assessment of trends in domestic inflation expectations.",
        "In addition, the 30-day commercial paper rate had previously risen faster than the Bank’s \nrate hikes, partly reflecting the two increases in reserve requirement ratios by the Bank \nlast year, which had caused funding conditions to tighten.",
        "Despite a recent downtrend \nin  the  30-day  commercial  paper  rate,  future  developments  in  the  money  markets  still \nrequire  monitoring.",
        "As  for  the  issue  of  a  negative  real  interest  rate,  if  inflation  is \nsuccessfully subdued, the real interest rate would turn positive; in contrast, if inflation \nstays elevated, further rate hikes could be warranted.",
        "Another board director noted that, beginning from 2021, unexpected events such \nas pandemic resurgences and the Russian-Ukraine war pushed up international energy \nand food prices, driving the domestic inflation rate upwards.",
        "With the Bank adopting a \ngradual tightening stance since March 2022, the average one-year time deposit floating \nrate of the top five domestic banks climbed correspondingly.",
        "Combined with the effect \nof  today’s rate hike  and  the  projected  inflation  slowdown,  the  currently  negative  real \ndeposit rate (the time deposit rate minus the inflation rate) would likely move closer to \npositive territory.",
        "In addition, the level of Taiwan’s real deposit rate was moderate \ncompared to major economies, with most of these economies also posting negative real \ndeposit rates.",
        "Given that the domestic economy  was expected to  grow at a slow pace \nowing to tepid exports and investment and that international economic conditions still \nfaced high uncertainties, a negative real interest rate would be conducive to fostering \neconomic growth.",
        "One  board  director  pointed out that, based on the Bank’s forecast  for Taiwan’s \nannual GDP growth rate this year, a negative growth rate in the first quarter would be \nfollowed  by  growth  above  2%  for  three  consecutive  quarters  in  the  rest  of  the  year.",
        "Meanwhile,  the  inflation  rate,  though  forecasted  to  run  above  2%  in  the  first  three \nquarters of the year, would likely come down to below 2% in the fourth quarter.",
        "In this \neconomic context, it would be necessary for the Bank to maintain its policy stance with \nfurther  rate  hikes.",
        "In  terms  of  the  upcoming  electricity  tariff  hike  in  April,  despite \nexternal estimations of the hike contributing 0.2 percentage points to the inflation rate, \n \n\nthe  effect  on  the  overall  price  trends  could  be  greater  than  estimated;  with  inflation \nexpectations being entrenched, higher electricity tariffs could drive up services prices \nincluding those of transportation, food away from home, and housing rent.",
        "Considering \nthat the hike could have a far wider ripple effect, close monitoring of its influence on \nfuture price gains is warranted.",
        "The board directors decided unanimously to raise the discount rate, the rate on \nrefinancing  of  secured  loans,  and  the  rate  on  temporary  accommodations  by \n0.125 percentage points to 1.875%, 2.25%, and 4.125%, respectively.",
        "Since the Board met in December last year, global economic and trade momentum \nhas  moderated,  prices  of  commodities  such  as  international  crude  oil  have \nexhibited  a  downtrend,  and  global  inflation  has  fallen  back  down  gradually.",
        "Recently,  major  central  banks  have  continued  with  monetary  policy  tightening, \nwhereas some central banks have slowed or paused the pace of policy rate hikes \nbased  on  the  assessment  of  economic  prospects  and  cumulative  effects  from \nprevious  rate  rises.",
        "Nevertheless,  in  view  of  inflationary  pressures  remaining \nelevated  in  major  economies,  high  interest  rates  could  persist  for  an  extended \nperiod.",
        "Global economic growth is expected to slow further in 2023.",
        "Looking  ahead,  the  monetary  tightening  effect  from  drastic  rate  hikes  by  major \ncentral banks in the US and Europe may spill over to other economies, intensifying \ndownside risks to the world economy.",
        "Meanwhile, tight labor markets in the US \nand  Europe  and  fragmentation  of  the  global  economy  could  make  it  difficult  to \nease  inflationary  pressures.",
        "In  addition,  the  pace  of  China's  economic  recovery, \nclimate change, and geopolitical risks could weigh on commodity prices, \nincreasing uncertainties over global inflation trends.",
        "Recent concerns over the turbulence in the banking sectors of the US and Europe \nand the ensuing effects on market expectations about the size of rate hikes by major \ncentral  banks  have  heightened  volatility  in  international  financial  markets.",
        "The \noutlook for global financial stability warrants close attention.",
        "From the beginning of 2023, with the easing of pandemic-related restrictions and \nborder  controls,  domestic  consumer  economic  activity  gradually  returned  to \nnormal, consumer confidence stabilized, and the retail and food/beverage sectors \nregistered  growing  sales.",
        "However,  as  waning  global  final  demand  prompted \nbusinesses to continue with inventory destocking, Taiwan's exports have witnessed \nnegative  growth  for  consecutive  months  and  private  investment  has  also  turned \nconservative.",
        "In terms of labor market conditions, the overall unemployment rate \ndropped,  yet  the  number  of  furloughed  employees  in  the  manufacturing  sector \nincreased.",
        "The economy is expected to grow modestly in the first half of this year, restrained \nby  weak  export  and  investment  growth.",
        "For  the  second  half  of  the  year,  despite \nsluggish investment growth, exports would likely regain momentum from reduced \ninventory levels in global supply chains, while domestic demand continues to firm \nup  thanks  to  solid  private  consumption  growth  and  the  government's  newly-\nlaunched  initiative  to  promote  post-pandemic  economic  resilience  and  to  share \ngrowth  results  nationwide  with  a  universal  surplus  tax  rebate  program;  it  is \ntherefore expected that economic growth would rebound in the latter half of 2023.",
        "The Bank revises its GDP growth forecast downward to 2.21% in 2023 (Appendix \nTable 1), a pace slower than the 2.45% in 2022.",
        "The annual growth rate of the consumer price index (CPI) averaged 2.74% for the \nfirst two months of the year owing mainly to price rises in food (such as food away \nfrom  home)  and  services  for  entertainment  as  well  as  higher  rent.",
        "The  annual \ngrowth  rate  of  the  core  CPI  (excluding  fruit,  vegetables,  and  energy  items) \naveraged 2.77% for the same period, edging down continuously since entering the \nsecond half of last year.",
        "For  year  2023  as  a  whole,  as  global  supply  chain  bottlenecks  are  likely  to  be \nresolved and raw material prices (including crude oil) are projected to trend lower \nthan 2022, it is expected that domestic inflation would also gradually cool down.",
        "Nonetheless,  with  resumption  of  normal  life  post  the  pandemic  likely  to  bolster \nprices of services for entertainment, the global outbreak of avian flu pushing up \ndomestic  food  prices,  and  electricity  rates  hiked  markedly,  the  Bank  therefore \nupgrades its forecasts for this year's CPI and core CPI annual growth rates to 2.09% \nfor  both  (Appendix  Table  2),  lower  than  the  previous  year's  2.95%  and  2.61%.",
        "However, this outlook could still change depending on prices trends of \ninternational commodities and domestic services, as well as weather events.",
        "Banks' excess reserves stayed slightly above NT$60 billion on average for the first \ntwo  months  of  the  year.",
        "The  annual  growth  rate  of  M2  (measured  on  a  daily \naverage basis) averaged 6.73% in the first two months of 2023, slowing from the \n7.25% of the fourth quarter of 2022.",
        "Bank loans and investments also decreased \nfrom 6.66% to 5.45%.",
        "Reflecting the Bank's monetary tightening, interest rates on \nbank  deposits  and  loans  rose  higher  and  money  market  rates  all  trended  up.",
        "Furthermore, Taiwan's banking system remains sound, well-capitalized, and flush \nwith  liquidity,  which  would  help  ward  off  destabilizing  effects  from  the  recent \nglobal financial market turmoil.",
        "Monetary  policy  decision:  The  Board  reached  a  unanimous  decision  to  raise  the \npolicy rates by 0.125 percentage points.",
        "In  today's  meeting,  the  Board  considered  the  following  assessment  of  economic \nand financial conditions at home and abroad.",
        "The international economic outlook \nstill faces  many  uncertainties and Taiwan's exports and investments would slow \nthis year.",
        "Nonetheless, steady private consumption growth and a rebound in export \nmomentum  are  expected  to  drive  economic  expansion  in  the  second  half  of  the \nyear;  for  the  year  as  a  whole,  the  economy  is  projected  to  post  mild  growth.",
        "In \nterms of inflation, the domestic inflation rate is on track to come down this year, \nwith  the  CPI  and  core  CPI  annual  growth  rates  both  forecasted  to  be  2.09%; \nhowever,  uncertainties  remain  for  this  outlook,  and  higher-than-usual  domestic \nprice gains in recent years could buoy up inflation expectations.",
        "To rein in inflation \nexpectations, the Board judged that a continued policy rate hike will help achieve \nthe  policy  objectives  of  promoting  price  stability  and  fostering  sound  economic \nand financial development on the whole.",
        "At  the  meeting  today,  the  Board  decided  to  raise  the  discount  rate,  the  rate  on \nrefinancing of secured loans, and the rate on temporary accommodations by 0.125 \npercentage  points  each  to  1.875%,  2.25%,  and  4.125%,  respectively,  effective \nMarch 24, 2023.",
        "Looking ahead, the Bank will continue to monitor the cumulative effects from its \nmonetary tightening since 2022 as well as the spillover of monetary policy moves \nby major economies and keep close watch on the fallout from the recent debacles \nin  some  US  and  European  banks.",
        "The  Bank  will  take  these  into  account  in \nassessing  the  implications  for  domestic  economic  and  financial  conditions  and \nadjust  its  monetary  policy  in  a  timely  manner  as  warranted,  so  as  to  fulfill  the \nstatutory duties of maintaining financial and price stability and fostering economic \ndevelopment within the scope of the above objectives.",
        "The  Bank's  recent  round  of  selective  credit  control  measures,  implemented  with \nfour successive amendments from December 2020, has so far successfully bolstered \ncredit risk management of the banking sector.",
        "In the year to date, growth in banks' \nconstruction and housing loans continued to slow, real estate lending as a share of \ntotal lending has broadly held steady, and the level of non-performing loan ratio for \nreal estate lending has stayed low.",
        "The effectiveness of the existing credit controls \nhave also been amplified by the Bank's continuous monetary policy tightening since \nMarch 2022.",
        "More results are also to emerge gradually as government agencies are \nmaking  headway  with  their  policy  efforts  under  the  Healthy  Real  Estate  Market \nPlan and improving relevant mechanisms and measures.",
        "In recent months, housing \nmarket transactions have decreased considerably and housing price uptrends have \nmoderated.",
        "Going forward, the Bank will continuously monitor the developments \nin  housing  credit  and  market,  review  the  implementation  of  the  selective  credit \ncontrol  measures,  and  make  adjustments  as  needed  in  order  to  promote  financial \nstability and sound banking operations.",
        "The NT dollar exchange rate is in principle determined by market forces.",
        "Nonetheless,  when  seasonal  or  irregular  factors  (such  as  massive  inflows  or \noutflows of short-term capital) lead to excess volatility and disorderly movements \nin the NT dollar exchange rate with adverse implications for economic and financial \nstability, the Bank, in line with its statutory mandates, will step in to maintain an \norderly market.",
        "Developments  since  the  Board  met  in  March  2023  suggested  that  advanced \neconomies  continued  to  experience  weak  growth  momentum,  and  their  central  banks \nwould likely keep interest rates at relatively high levels for some time in view of still \nstrong inflationary pressures.",
        "It was therefore projected that the global economy would \ngrow  at  a  slower  pace  this  year.",
        "By  sector,  the  manufacturing  industry  suffered  a \ndownturn as global final demand was hit by the cumulative tightening effect from major \ncentral banks’ aggressive rate hikes, whereas the services sector rebounded as countries \nlifted pandemic-related restrictions.",

        "In view of a still high proportion of real estate lending in total lending in recent months, \nthe Bank judged it was necessary to continue with credit control measures in order to \nimprove management of credit resources of the banking sector and to mitigate credit \nrisks associated therewith.",
        "Currently, the only restriction imposed on the newly-\nextended second housing loans for homes in the “specific areas” was the prohibition of a grace period (during which borrowers pay just the interest but not the principal) \nand some banks appeared to have applied looser mortgage underwriting standards \ncompared to other banks.",

        "(c) The average LTV ratio for natural persons’ second housing loans for homes in the \n“specific areas” was high and on the rise: The Bank’s statistical data showed that \nthe average LTV ratio of this loan bracket was 75.5% in October 2021 but rose to \n77.1% in April, showing a trend towards looser loan underwriting by banks.",

        "One  board  director  pointed  out  that  the  Bank,  in  view  of  weak  momentum  for \ndomestic  economic  growth,  downgraded its forecast for Taiwan’s 2023 GDP growth \nrate to below 2% with a possibility of turning lower.",
        "Meanwhile, manufacturing growth \nstaggered, and exports contracted for nine months in a row.",
        "It was expected that exports \nand  private  investment  would  both  post  negative  real  growth  this  year.",
        "Given  such \nprospects, a further rate hike would not be appropriate.",
        "In addition, the inflation rate had \neased and forecasted by the Bank to fall to below 2% in the fourth quarter and to register \nlower for the year as a whole compared to last year.",
        "The director therefore approved of \na rate hold.",
        "One  board  director  stated  that  continued  rate  hikes  by  various  central  banks  to \ncontain  inflation  had  inhibited  global  economic  growth.",
        "Against  this  backdrop,  weak \nfinal  demand  had  led  to  continuous  supply  chain  inventory  drawdown,  dampening \nTaiwan’s exports.",
        "According to the Directorate  General  of  Budget,  Accounting  and \nStatistics  (DGBAS),  exports  would  resume  positive  growth  in  the  fourth  quarter  but \nwould still be in contraction territory for the year as a whole.",
        "Domestic demand, on the \nother hand, gained support from private consumption thanks to the lifting of pandemic-\nrelated  restrictions  and  the  universal  surplus  tax  rebates  as  well  as  other  stimulus \nschemes under the government’s special budget for post-pandemic economic recovery.",
        "In sum, Taiwan’s economy  was  “warm inside, cold outside,” experiencing  moderate \ndomestic demand growth compounded by an external demand downturn.",
        "The Bank took \na cautious view on this year’s GDP growth while forecasted the inflation rate to come \ndown  gradually.",
        "The  director  approved  of  a  policy  rate  hold,  citing  the  multitude  of \nuncertainties over the economic outlook.",
        "One  board  director  noted  that  the  Bank’s  GDP  growth  forecast  downgrade  was \nmainly  attributable  to  shrinking  exports.",
        "The  director  then  cited  the  International \nMonetary  Fund,  whose  World  Economic  Outlook  stated  that  continued  rate  hikes  by \nmajor economies since last year caused the world to face  anemic economic growth in \nthe  next  five  years,  a  rocky  road  fraught  with  uncertainties.",
        "In  this  light,  a  rate  hold \nwould be the sensible decision that would allow the Bank to pause for new information \nsuch as the lagged effect of monetary tightening and take stock of a need for future rate \nadjustments.",
        "Another  board  director,  in  favor  of  a  rate  hold,  stated  that  a  pause  would  be \nappropriate so that the Bank may review the effects of its monetary policy and take this \ninto consideration for the next policy meeting.",
        "Nevertheless, the director cautioned that \nprices  of  services  continued  to  rise  markedly  and,  like  core  inflation,  tend  to  resist \ndownward change; it was important to prevent inflation expectations from firming up.",
        "One  board  director  pointed  out  that  the  Bank  trimmed  the  forecast  for  the  2023 \nGDP growth rate by 0.5 percentage points in June, a considerable downgrade compared \nto  its  March  forecast.",
        "In  addition,  several  neighboring  economies  had  turned  less \nhawkish  with  rate holds or even rate cuts.",
        "Meanwhile, Taiwan’s inflation was also \ntrending  down.",
        "Given  the  above,  it  would  be  appropriate  to  keep  the  policy  rates \nunchanged.",
        "One board director pointed to such developments as the Fed pausing rate hikes in \nJune,  domestic  inflation  stabilizing,  the  economy  contracting  significantly  in  the  first \nquarter, and the Bank already delivering five rate hikes.",
        "Therefore, a rate hold would be \na reasonable decision for today’s Meeting.",
        "One board director noted that although  recent declines in  animal  feed costs took \npork prices lower, price stickiness would prevent related food-away-from-home prices \nfrom decreasing correspondingly.",
        "In the CPI basket, the top 17 staple goods continued \nseeing marked rises, and services and food away from home  showed downward price \nstickiness.",
        "For  the  year  as  a  whole,  it  was  expected  that  a  higher  base  effect  would \nweaken this year’s inflation rate provided that prices  of  pork  and  other  related  items \nwould  not  rise  further.",
        "In  terms  of  economic  growth,  the  pace  of  expansion  would \nprobably fall  short of 2%.",
        "Export  growth has  been a key driving force for Taiwan, but \nrecently it shrank faster than in South Korea and Japan, mainly owing to higher bases in \nthe previous three years amid an economic boom.",
        "Given the above, a further rate hike at \nthis  juncture,  while  having  an  uncertain  effect  on  core  inflation,  could  risk  dampening \ndomestic demand instead.",
        "In addition, Taiwan’s inflation was primarily fueled by external \nfactors; and while the unemployment rate came to a 23-year low in April, efforts to bring \ndown inflation would imply a trade-off towards higher unemployment.",
        "Furthermore, the \neconomy already passed its fifteenth cyclical peak and began slowing gradually.",
        "In this \nview, the director approved of a rate hold and added that the Bank needs to closely monitor \nfuture price trends as reference for future interest rate decision-making.",
        "One board director, referring to Taiwan’s “warm inside, cold outside” economy, \npointed  out  that  while  external  demand  was  dampened  by  tighter  monetary  and \neconomic  conditions  abroad,  domestic  private  investment  could  also  be  dented  as \nexports and the manufacturing production index continued declining.",
        "Without a pause \nin rate hikes, corporate investment could take a further hit.",
        "Therefore, a rate hold is the \nright  decision,  while  continuous  monitoring  of  future  domestic  price  trends  remains \nimportant.",
        "At present, the CPI sub-index of top 17 staple goods continued to record high \nannual growth rates, likely adding to inflation expectations.",
        "Although the headline and \ncore  inflation  rates  were  edging  downwards,  their  average  values  for  the  first  five \nmonths  of  2023  were  still  higher  than  those  of  the  previous  ten  years.",
        "Moreover,  the \naverage  real  annual  growth  rates  of  total  employee  earnings  turned  negative  for  the \nJanuary-April  period  of  the  year,  the  first  negative  growth  in  seven  years,  warranting \ncontinued attention to the potential impact of prices on real total earnings growth.",
        "One board director pointed out that external demand shocks have been the key driver \nof Taiwan’s business cycles and, in particular, export growth; domestic interest rate policy \ncould be of help, albeit to a limited extent.",
        "The director cited recent data as the reasons \nbacking up a rate hold for now: First, the headline inflation rate began trending down after \na streak of rate hikes and the economy still faced a relatively low probability of recession \nin the next quarter despite the recent forecast downgrade.",
        "As for core inflation, it slowed \nslightly  but  remained  elevated.",
        "In  particular,  the  top  17  staples  continued  to  post \nsignificant  year-on-year  price  rises,  which  could  raise  public  expectations  of  inflation.",
        "Taking into account the upside and downside factors, the director approved of a rate hold \nand noted that, given the transmission lags of monetary policy, it was with hope that more \neffects would show progressively.",
        "However, the Bank should, at the sign of resurgence in \nheadline  or core inflation, confront  it proactively and raise the policy rates  at a regular \npace.",
        "Another board director approved of a rate hold and expressed concern about rising \nprices.",
        "For the first five months of the year, the annual growth rate of the CPI sub-index \nof top 17 staples averaged higher than the previous year and that of the core CPI was \nalso  elevated.",
        "Meanwhile,  higher  rents  continued  to  exert  upside  pressures  on  the \ninflation rate.",
        "Food price trends also require continued monitoring as they face potential \nshocks from supply uncertainties owing to weather-related interruptions or grain export \ncontrols  implemented  by  several  major  crop-producing  economies.",
        "If  inflation  shows \nany hint of becoming unanchored by the next Board Meeting, the Bank should take a \nstronger approach to contain inflation.",
        "(2) Discussion on the proposition to adjust selective credit control measures \nSeveral board directors expressed the opinion that by introducing a new 70% cap \non the LTV ratio on second housing loans taken out by natural persons for homes in the \ndesignated “specific areas” it would help enhance lending risk management of banks, \nimprove  proper  allocation  of  credit  resources,  achieve  a  healthy  housing  market,  and \npromote financial stability.",
        "One board director shared that  the Bank noticed a continuous increase in banks’ \nreal estate loans with a large balance as a percentage  of total  loans.",
        "There was also  a \nrising number of second housing loans taken out by natural persons, making up a greater \nshare of total borrowers of newly-extended housing loans.",
        "As some banks became more \nflexible about the LTV ratios, the average LTV ratio of natural persons’ second housing \nloans in the “specific areas” thus climbed to above 70%.",
        "The proposition to restrict the \nLTV ratios of this loan bracket seemed to aim at the concern that excessive lending to \nthe  real  estate  sector  could  undermine  banks’ risk control.",
        "In  this  view,  the  director \napproved of this proposition.",
        "One  board  director  remarked  that  the  previous  series  of  selective  credit  controls \nwere indeed introduced with the aim of a healthy housing market; in the meantime, the \nBank continued monitoring banks’ loan portfolio to curb an inordinate flow of capital \ninto the real estate sector.",
        "The director was in favor of the new control measure.",
        "Another \nboard director also stated that, given the interest rate hold, implementing a new 70% cap \non the second housing loans by natural persons for homes in the “specific areas” would \nimprove the efficiency of bank credit resources.",
        "One  board  director  noted  that  not  only  housing  price  rises  eased  but  transaction \nlevel also cooled down somewhat.",
        "In addition, the annual growth rates of housing loans \nand construction loans both declined.",
        "These developments carried positive implications \nfor financial stability and indicated that the Bank’s rate hikes were beginning to show \nresults.",
        "One board director expressed the view that financial crises in history tended to be \nassociated with real estate market debacles, warranting the Bank’s earnest attention to \nthis  sector.",
        "And  the  current  higher  ratio  of  housing  credit  to  total  bank  lending  also \nrepresented  potential  financial  risk  that  should  be  mitigated.",
        "Another  board  director \npointed out that in one of the previous amendments to the selective credit controls, the \ngrace  period  was  removed  for  natural persons’ second housing loans in the “specific \nareas” but no LTV ratio caps were introduced concurrently.",
        "This seemed to have  led \nbanks to gradually relax loan standards for this bracket and somewhat fueled speculative \nsentiment.",
        "In this view, the director approved of this amendment.",
        "One board director stated that, from the perspective of bank lending risk \nmanagement, it was sensible to introduce the new restriction.",
        "The average LTV ratio of \nnatural persons’ second housing loans in the “specific areas” was  75.5%  in  October \n2021; thereafter, it rose to 77.1% in April 2023.",
        "A 70% cap seemed to be the appropriate \nmove without excessive impact.",
        "Several  board  directors  discussed  the  level  of  the  new  cap.",
        "One  board  director \npointed out that, for the second housing loans taken out by natural persons for homes in \nthe “specific areas,” the proposed cap on the LTV ratio was 70%, while the current cap \non the third housing loans and on any housing loans taken out by corporate entities was \n40%.",
        "The different cap levels for different loan types showed that today’s new rule took \ninto account the actual needs of homebuyers (e.g., needs to expand or downsize, to buy \nhomes for children/parents, to move, etc.).",
        "The new restriction was judged to be able to \nnudge  second  home  buyers  towards  selling  their  first  homes  sooner  as  they  could  be \nexempted from the 70% cap when repaying the first housing loan within a short period \nafter taking out the second one.",
        "Furthermore, compared to the previous 60% cap on the \nsame loan bracket implemented in June 2010 and the current bank data average of 77%, \nthe new cap of 70% was moderate.",
        "The board directors decided unanimously to keep the discount rate, the rate on \nrefinancing  of  secured  loans,  and  the  rate  on  temporary  accommodations \nunchanged  at  1.875%,  2.25%,  and  4.125%,  respectively,  and  to  adjust  the \nselective credit controls.",
        "The board directors approved unanimously to issue the following press release in \nthe post-meeting press conference,  together  with the Supplementary  Materials for the \nPost-Monetary Policy Meeting Press Conference prepared by the Bank.",
        "Since  the  Board  met  in  March  this  year,  the  cumulative  tightening  effects  of \ncontinuous rate hikes by major central banks in the US and Europe have weakened \nglobal final demand and resulted in a tepid performance in the manufacturing sector.",
        "Nevertheless,  the  lifting  of  pandemic-related  restrictions  in  most  countries  has \nsupported a rebound in the services sector.",
        "Against such a background, commodity \nprices  have  registered  a  narrower  increase  because  of  cooling  demand,  whereas \nservices  price  increase  have  remained  stubbornly  strong  as  a  partial  shift  of \nconsumer demand from commodity to services boosted demand for food/beverage \nand entertainment services and the related imbalance between services labor supply \nand  demand  also  pushed  up  labor  costs.",
        "As  a  consequence,  global  inflation  has \ntrended down at a rather gradual pace.",
        "Recently, some central banks continued raising policy rates, yet a few central banks \npaused  the  pace  of  rate  hikes  in  order  to  assess  the  cumulative  effects  of  this \nmonetary tightening cycle on economic activity and inflation.",
        "In view of inflationary \npressures  in  major  economies  remaining  elevated,  interest  rates  could  stay  at \nrestrictive  levels  for  a  considerable  time.",
        "It  is  therefore  expected  that  global \neconomic and trade growth momentum would remain sluggish.",
        "Looking  ahead,  the  global  economic  and  financial  outlooks  are  still  shrouded  in \nmany uncertainties, such as the duration of policy rates of major economies staying \nhigh, the degree of tightening of global financial conditions, the pace of China’s \neconomic recovery, geopolitical risks, and climate change.",
        "For the first quarter of the  year, private consumption picked up as life gradually \nreturned to normal as domestic pandemic-related restrictions and border controls \nwere  further  relaxed.",
        "Nevertheless,  a  sluggish  global  economy  and  continued \ninventory  reductions  in  supply  chains  caused  Taiwan's  exports  to  decrease  even \nmore markedly, while growth in private investment also turned negative.",
        "Overall, \nthe  annual  GDP  growth  rate  slowed  to  -2.87%  in  the  first  quarter.",
        "Thereafter, \ndespite continued weakness in exports and private investment in recent months, an \nexpansion  in  private  consumption  was  expected  to  bolster  economic  growth  for \nthe  second  quarter.",
        "Meanwhile,  labor  market  conditions  improved  with the \nunemployment  rate  coming  down  and  the  number  of  employed  persons  rising \nfurther.",
        "In the year so far, nominal total earnings in the services sector rose over \nthe  same  period  last  year  thanks  to  post-pandemic  resurgence  in  face-to-face \nconsumption activity, whereas the manufacturing sector, hit by shrinking exports, \nposted  slower  year-on-year  earnings  growth  and  experienced  an  increase  in  the \nnumber of furloughed employees.",
        "For the outlook of the second half of 2023, while private consumption is likely to \ncontinue  growing  steadily,  exports  would  also  gradually  gather  steam  amid  a \nstabilizing global economy and demand for emerging technology applications.",
        "The \nBank expected Taiwan's economic growth to accelerate in the second half of the \nyear  compared  to  the  previous  half.",
        "For  the  year  as  a  whole,  the  economy  was \nforecasted  to  expand  by  1.72%  (see  Appendix  Table  for  the  forecasts  by  major \ninstitutions), down from the March projection of 2.21%.",
        "In the months from March onwards, moderating price increases in food items (such \nas fruit and vegetables) and softening fuel and lubricant fees combined to drive the \nannual growth rate  of the consumer price  index (CPI) on a slow downtrend that \nbegan in the second half of 2022, taking the inflation rate to 2.02% in May.",
        "The \nannual growth rate of the core CPI (excluding fruit, vegetables, and energy items) \nwas 2.57% in May, a slower descent mainly because of demand-driven price rises \nin  domestic  accommodation  and  food  services  in  the  post-pandemic  period.",
        "For \nthe first five months of 2023, the annual growth rate of the CPI averaged 2.44% \nand that of the core CPI averaged 2.68%.",
        "Looking at  the second  half of 2023, it was expected that prices of crude oil and \nother raw materials would trend below the levels of 2022, bringing down related \nimport  prices  for  Taiwan  and  thus  leading  to  a  further  softening  in  domestic \ncommodity  prices.",
        "However,  domestic  services  prices  stayed  elevated  owing  to \nprice  rises  in  entertainment  services  and  in  food  away  from  home,  the  latter  of \nwhich  reflected  higher  food  ingredients  and  hiring  costs.",
        "The  Bank  therefore \nforecasted  that  the  inflation  rate  would  continue  to  come  down  gradually  in  the \nsecond half of the year, with the headline and core inflation rates projected to slow \ndown  to  2.24%  and  2.38%  (see  Appendix  Table  for  the  forecasts  by  major \ninstitutions) in 2023 from 2.95% and 2.61% the previous year, while noting that \nprice trends of international commodities and domestic services and the effects of \nweather events could still affect the domestic inflation outlook in the second half \nof this year.",
        "Banks'  excess  reserves  stayed  slightly  above  NT$60  billion  on  average  for  the \nMarch-April period.",
        "The annual growth rate of M2 (measured on a daily average \nbasis) decreased from 7.25% in the fourth quarter of 2022 to an average of 6.69% \nin  the  first  four  months  of  2023.",
        "Bank  loans  and  investments  further  decreased \nfrom 6.66% of the fourth quarter of 2022 to 5.55% in the first four months of 2023.",
        "Short-term  market  rates  and  interest  rates  on  bank  deposits  and  loans  both \nexhibited  uptrends  following  the  Bank's  March  rate  hike,  the  fifth  one  in  this \ntightening cycle.",
        "Monetary policy decisions: The Board decided unanimously to hold the policy rates \nsteady and to adjust the selective credit control measures   \n In  today's  meeting,  the  Board  considered  the  following  assessment  of  economic \nand  financial  conditions  at  home  and  abroad.",
        "Domestic  inflation  is  expected  to \ncome down moderately in the second half of the year, bringing the inflation rate to \naround 2% in the fourth quarter.",
        "Meanwhile, the international economic outlook is \nconfronted  by  many  uncertainties,  the  domestic  output  gap  would  likely  turn \nnegative,  and  the  domestic  economy  is  projected  to  grow  at  a  slower  pace  than \npreviously forecasted.",
        "Taking into account the previous streak of five policy rate \nhikes and two increases in the required reserve ratios, the Board judged that a rate \nhold would allow the Bank to assess the cumulative effects and implications of its \nmonetary tightening and would help foster sound economic and financial \ndevelopment on the whole.",
        "At the meeting today, the Board decided to maintain the discount rate, the rate on \nrefinancing of secured loans, and the rate on temporary accommodations at current \nlevels of 1.875%, 2.25%, and 4.125%, respectively.",
        "Looking ahead, the Bank will continue to  monitor the implications for domestic \neconomic activity and financial conditions arising from domestic monetary \ntightening and from the spillovers of major central banks' rate hikes.",
        "Accordingly, \nthe Bank will adjust its monetary policy in a timely manner as warranted, so as to \nfulfill the statutory duties of maintaining financial and price stability and fostering \neconomic development within the scope of the above objectives.",
        "The Bank has made four adjustments to its selective credit control measures since \nDecember 2020.",
        "The policy measures have so far effectively helped banks mitigate \ncredit  risk  associated  with  real  estate  lending,  reflected  by  steady  slowdown  in \nbanks' construction and housing loan growth and the continuously low level of the \nnon-performing loan ratio for real estate lending.",
        "Nevertheless, recent indicators showed that real estate lending still made up a large \nproportion in total bank lending; in the first quarter of 2023, second home loans \ntaken out by natural persons saw both an increase in number and an expansion in \nits  ratio  to  total  borrowers  of  newly-extended  home  loans,  compared  to  the \nprevious quarter; and the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio granted to second home loans \ntaken out by natural persons for homes in the designated ''specific areas'' averaged \nat high levels and continued rising.",
        "In this light, the Bank decided to amend the \nRegulations Governing the Extension of Mortgage Loans by Financial Institutions \nwith  the  aim  of  further  strengthening  management  of  bank  credit  resources  and \ncontaining  related  credit  risk.",
        "The  amendments,  including  the  introduction  of  a \n70% cap on the LTV ratio for a second home loan of a natural person for housing \nin  a  \"specific  area,\"  will  take  effect  on  June  16,  2023  (see  Appendix  for  more \ndetails).",
        "It is expected that  more results will continue  to emerge as government agencies \nare making headway with their policy efforts under the Healthy Real Estate Market \nPlan and improving relevant mechanisms and measures.",
        "Going forward, the Bank \nwill continuously monitor the developments in housing credit and market, review \nthe implementation of the selective credit control measures, and make adjustments \nas needed in order to promote financial stability and sound banking operations.",
        "The NT dollar exchange rate is in principle determined by market forces.",
        "Nonetheless,  when  seasonal  or  irregular  factors  (such  as  massive  inflows  or \noutflows of short-term capital) lead to excess volatility or disorderly movements in \nthe NT dollar exchange rate with adverse implications for economic and financial \nstability,  the  Bank,  in  accordance  with  its  statutory  mandates,  will  step  in  to \nmaintain an orderly market.",
        "Since  the  Board  last  met  in  September  2023,  the  lagged  effect  of  monetary \ntightening  by  major  economies  had  dampened  goods  consumption  demand,  and  the \nglobal  Manufacturing  PMI  (Purchasing  Managers’  Index)  remained  below  the  50-\nthreshold for expansion.",
        "Meanwhile, the services sector expanded at a slower pace as \npost-pandemic activity of cross-border travel and entertainment services cooled down \nsomewhat.",
        "With  the  monetary  tightening  effects  continuing  to  manifest,  international \ninstitutions  forecasted  that  the  US,  Japan,  and  China  would  witness  softer  economic \ngrowth next year, along with a cautious outlook for both the euro area and the UK, while \nthe global economy would expand with weaker momentum than this year.",
        "In  regard  to  global  commodities,  oil  prices  turned  lower  from  October  onwards \nowing to a softer-than-expected impact of the Israel-Hamas conflict on crude oil supply, \na still tepid Chinese economy, and increased US crude oil inventories.",
        "For next year, oil \nprices were  forecasted  by international institutions to rebound slightly from this  year.",
        "Grains prices had stayed low with modest volatility since October and the \nReuters/Jefferies  CRB  (RJ/CRB)  Index,  a  global  commodities  benchmark,  moved \ndownwards alongside crude oil price declines.",
        "In regard  to inflation in major economies, downtrends in energy and food prices \namid the easing of supply chain bottlenecks, coupled with a higher base effect, led the \ninflation rates of major economies to drop swiftly.",
        "However, the core inflation rates did \nnot  drop  as  fast,  reflecting  slower  services  price  decreases  owing  to  downward  price \nstickiness.",
        "While cumulative effects of aggressive tightening by major central banks and \nprice declines in crude oil and other commodities have led to swift marked declines in \ninflation rates of most major economies this year, a further but slower downtrend was \nexpected for next year.",
        "In terms of recent  central bank policy  moves, the US Federal Reserve (Fed) and \nthe European Central Bank (ECB) kept their policy rates unchanged while the Bank of\nJapan (BoJ) and the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) stayed dovish.",
        "In  the  financial markets,  softening  US  inflation  and signs of  the  economy \nweakening boosted market expectations of an earlier rate cut by the Fed next year, thus \nsending the 10-year US Treasury yields sharply down and causing a broad rally across \nmajor  stock  markets  around  the  world.",
        "Meanwhile,  the  US  dollar  index  slid  from \nprevious peaks, leading most major currencies to strengthen against the US dollar.",
        "Looking ahead, global economic prospects are clouded by many downside risks, \nincluding the cumulative effect of major central banks’ tightening and the duration for \nthe  policy  rates  to  stay  elevated,  which  could  have  adverse  implications  for  global \neconomic development and financial stability; negative  spillovers  from  China’s \neconomic  slowdown,  which  could  cast  a  shadow  over  the  world  economy;  global \neconomic  fragmentation  and  supply  chain  restructuring,  which  could  affect  global \neconomic and trade development.",
        "In addition, geopolitical risks and climate change also \nadd to uncertainties facing global inflation trends.",
        "Recent  data  showed  the  coincident  indicators  improved  but  leading  indicators \ncontinued  to  deteriorate,  suggesting  lingering  sluggishness  in  Taiwan.",
        "The  domestic \nmanufacturing sector experienced relatively weak growth momentum.",
        "Taiwan’s \nManufacturing  PMI  recorded  the  ninth  monthly  reading  in  contraction  territory  in \nNovember 2023, whereas the Non-Manufacturing Index (NMI) pointed to expansion for \nthe 13th month in a row with its business sentiment for future outlook turning towards \nexpansion.",
        "In respect of external demand, a slow global economic recovery caused Taiwan’s \nexports to shrink by 11.5% during the first eleven months of the year; all major product \ncategories recorded negative growth, except for ICT/AV (information, communication \nand technology, and audio-visual) products thanks to demand for AI and other emerging \ntechnology  applications.",
        "For  next  year,  it was expected Taiwan’s exports would be \nbuoyed up by stronger world trade growth than this year, booming demand for emerging  \ntechnology  applications,  and  consumers’ sustained  appetite  for  cross-border  travel.",
        "Given  a  lower  base  effect,  the  Bank  forecasted  that  the  annual  real  growth  rate  of \nTaiwan’s exports would turn positive in 2024.",
        "In regard to domestic demand, growth in private investment would benefit from the \nexecution of deferred investment plans this year, and from further investment promises \nby  major  chipmakers  and  semiconductor  supply-chain  firms  in  order  to  maintain  a \nleading  edge  as  well  as  by  the  corporate  sector  moving  towards  net-zero  energy \ntransition.",
        "Taking into account a lower comparison base this year, the Bank forecasted \nthat next year’s real growth in private investment would excess this year’s.",
        "Regarding  private  consumption,  post-pandemic  consumer  sentiment  for  travel \nwould  likely  remain  high,  while  household  disposable  income  would  gain  from  a \nminimum wage hike, a public sector pay-raise, and a further rise in the income tax-free \nbasic living expenses allowance.",
        "For next  year,  the Bank projected that  a higher base \neffect would result in mild real growth in private consumption.",
        "Regarding labor market conditions in recent months, the total number of employed \npersons  continued  to  post  month-on-month  increases  and  the  unemployment  rate \ndecreased further.",
        "In terms of annual changes in the number of employed persons, the \nmanufacturing sector posted a further decrease in October while the services sector saw \nan  increase.",
        "In  regard  to  wage  growth  during  the  first  ten  months  of  the  year,  total \nnominal earnings of workers in the industrial and services sectors grew by 1.53% year \non  year,  the  smallest  increase  in  the  past  three  years,  with  manufacturing  employees \nwitnessing markedly slower growth in their total nominal earnings against a weak export \nperformance.",
        "Overall, the Bank forecasted Taiwan’s economic growth rate to be 1.40% this year, \nbased on the assessment of tepid export growth momentum, and a potential dampening \neffect therefrom on private investment growth, against a background of a weaker-than-\nexpected  recovery  of  global  final  demand.",
        "As  for  next  year,  given  the  anticipated \nrebound in exports and private investment, mild growth in private consumption, and an \ncontinued  increase  in  government  spending,  as  well  as  a  lower  base  effect,  the  Bank \nforecasted that Taiwan’s economy would expand at a faster pace of 3.12% in 2024.",
        "Compared to the Bank’s previous forecast in September 2023, the 1.40% growth \nprojected  for  this  year  represented  a  slight  downgrade  of  0.06  percentage  points  to \nreflect  a  softer-than-expected  performance  in  exports  and  private  investment.",
        "On  the \nother hand, the Bank slightly upgraded the GDP growth forecast for next year by 0.04 \npercentage points to 3.12%, reflecting the projections that private consumption would \ncontinue growing and export growth would gather steam.",
        "In addition, the Bank estimated that Taiwan would have a negative output gap in \nboth 2023 and 2024.",
        "Major institutions at home and abroad expected Taiwan’s economy \nto grow by 1.02%-1.70% in 2023 and by 2.36%-3.35% in 2024.",
        "Short-term market interest rates climbed higher in September 2023, reflecting end-\nof-quarter funding needs, the Mid-Autumn Festival long-weekend holiday, provisional \npayments of profit-seeking enterprise income tax, and continued net selling and outward \nremittances by foreign institutional investors.",
        "By November, as foreign capital \nmovements turned from net outflows into net inflows, the interest rates remained high \nbut with subdued fluctuations.",
        "For the months of September to October, excess reserves \nof banks averaged around NT$54 billion.",
        "With regard to bank credit in the year so far, weak corporate funding needs amid a \ntepid global economy led to a lower annual growth rate of working capital loans, while \nloans  to  the  real  estate  sector  also  declined  over  the  same  period  last  year  (2022), \nresulting  in  a  slower  pace  of  year-on-year  growth  in  bank  lending.",
        "For  the  first  ten \nmonths of the year, bank loans and investments posted an average annual growth rate of \n5.82%, lower than 7.55% in the same period last year.",
        "In respect of money supply, owing to the economic slowdown and weaker annual \ngrowth  in  bank  loans  and  investments  so  far  this  year,  the  annual  growth  rate  of  the \nmonetary aggregate M2, measured on a daily average basis, decreased to 6.44% during \nthe Jan.-Oct. period from the 7.54% recorded in the same period last year, still within \nthe reference range of 2.5%-6.5%.",
        "Based on the estimations of the money demand function, the annual growth rate of\nM2 demand will remain between 2.5% and 6.5% next year.",
        "Furthermore, though a mild \ndomestic economic recovery and gradual disinflation was projected  for next  year, the \nrecovery momentum could be dampened by external factors amid elevated uncertainty \nsurrounding international political, economic, and financial conditions.",
        "In this view, the \nBank maintains the M2 growth reference range at the current 2.5%-6.5% for the  year \n2024.",
        "The Bank will strive to sufficiently meet funding demand of the private sector so \nas to foster economic growth.",
        "In the housing market, transactions climbed back up in recent months, buoyed by \nthe launch of the enhanced preferential housing loan program for young homebuyers, as \nwell  as  an  increased  supply  of  newly-built  housing  units  and  a  lower  base  effect.",
        "Meanwhile, housing price rises continued but at a slower pace.",
        "Construction and real \nestate industries, along with banks, remained cautious about the housing market outlook.",
        "Since the Bank implemented selected credit control measures with a total of five \namendments  beginning December 2020, the annual growth rate of banks’ real estate \nlending had slowed down.",
        "As of October 2023, the annual growth rates of housing loans \nand  of  construction  loans  were  both  lower  than  the  levels  before  the  selective  credit \ncontrols.",
        "In addition, the non-performing loan ratios of these two loan brackets stayed \nlow, indicating good credit quality.",
        "In  the  months  from  July  onwards,  supply  shock  from  weather  events  including \nsuccessive strikes of typhoons and torrential rain pushed up the prices of vegetables and \nfruit, causing food inflation to gather steam.",
        "As a result, the annual growth rate of the \nconsumer price index (CPI) went back up, reaching 2.90% in November.",
        "Meanwhile, \nthe  annual  growth  rate  of  the  core  CPI  (i.e.,  excluding  fruit,  vegetables,  and  energy \nitems) continued to fall gradually to 2.38% in November, the lowest since March 2022.",
        "During the first eleven months of the year, the CPI increased by 2.48% on average \nover the same period last year.",
        "Of this increase, 66% was attributed to price rises in food \n(such as food away from home and meat) and entertainment services, as well as higher \nrents, with a combined contribution of 1.64 percentage points.",
        "For the same period, the core CPI posted an average annual growth rate of 2.60%.",
        "By  frequency  of  purchase,  prices  of  staples  more  frequently  purchased  rose  at  a \nslightly slower pace in November.",
        "With international raw material prices coming down, \ndomestic  import  prices  consequently  saw  negative  growth  for  consecutive  months, \nindicating still subdued pressure from imported inflation.",
        "By type of items, recent data showed that rises in services prices were moderate.",
        "The  annual  growth  rate  of  the  CPI  came  back  down  in  November,  mainly  owing  to \nslower increases in prices of vegetables, fuel and lubricants, and entertainment services.",
        "For next year, domestic commodity prices would likely rise mildly as international \ninstitutions forecasted a slight rebound in oil prices, whereas domestic services prices \nwould see slower rises owing to a higher base effect.",
        "The Bank forecasted the CPI and \ncore CPI inflation rates to further decrease from 2.46% and 2.56% in 2023 to 1.89% and \n1.83% in 2024, respectively.",
        "Forecasts by  major domestic and foreign institutions for \nTaiwan’s inflation rate ranged between 2.24%  and  2.51%  for  this  year  and  between \n1.64% and 2.70% for the year 2024.",
        "The future path of domestic inflation could be affected by the following key factors.",
        "Sources of upside pressures include  (1) continuous  services price upswings  including \ntourism and hospitality services at home and abroad, buttressed by strong willingness to \ntravel of domestic consumers; (2) global oil prices rising faster than this year according \nto the projections of international institutions; (3) domestic prices receiving a boost from \nthe 2024 hikes in the minimum wage and public sector pay.",
        "On the other hand, downside \npressures could come from reductions in prices of mobile phones and other \ncommunication devices.",
        "(1) The 2023 domestic inflation rate posted a gradual decline from the previous year, and \nthe 2024 inflation rate would likely come down further to around 2%.",
        "According to the Bank’s projections, the annual CPI and core CPI growth rates \nwould be 2.46% and 2.56% this year, lower than the 2.95% and 2.61% registered\nlast year.",
        "For next year, considering that domestic commodity prices may rise mildly as global \noil prices are to rebound from this year’s levels according to international institutions, \nand that domestic services prices are expected to post a slower increase owing to a \nhigher base effect, the Bank forecasts Taiwan’s annual CPI and core CPI growth \nrates to further come down to 1.89% and 1.83%.",
        "C. The future path of domestic inflation trends could be affected by movements of \ninternational commodity prices, domestic services prices, and weather events.",
        "(2)    In 2024, the domestic economy is expected to witness a negative output gap, and a \nslowing global economy facing many risks to its outlook could further weigh on the \ndomestic economic recovery.",
        "A. Taiwan’s economic growth rate is forecasted by the Bank to be 1.40% this year and \n3.12% next year.",
        "International institutions forecasts slower global economic growth next year than \nthis year.",
        "The following uncertainties are expected to surround the global economic \nand financial outlook: (1) The duration of high policy rates adopted by major central \nbanks, (2) China’s economic downturn, and (3) global economic fragmentation and \nsupply chain restructuring, all of which could dampen the momentum for the world \nto achieve an economic recovery.",
        "Policy  Propositions:  To  maintain  the  discount  rate,  the  rate  on  refinancing  of \nsecured loans, and the rate on temporary accommodations at 1.875%,  2.25%, \nand 4.125%, respectively     \n2.",
        "Board members reached a unanimous decision to keep the policy rates unchanged.",
        "Related discussions are summarized as follows.",
        "One  board  director  expressed  support  for  the  rate  hold  proposition.",
        "The  average \nvalues of forecasts by major domestic and foreign institutions showed that Taiwan’s \nGDP growth next year would outpace this year, while the inflation rate would be lower \nthan  this  year.",
        "However,  lingering  geopolitical  risks,  supply  chain  restructuring,  and \nclimate change could affect Taiwan’s future economic growth rate.",
        "In addition, because \nprices  of  food  away  from  home,  prices  of  entertainment  services,  and  rent  tend  to \nexperience downward price stickiness, which could affect Taiwan’s GDP and inflation \ngrowth, the price trends thereof require continuous close monitoring.",
        "Another board director pointed out that momentum for  Taiwan’s  exports, \ninvestment,  and  manufacturing  growth  had  been  relatively  subdued  so  far,  business \nsentiment for the outlook was also comparatively pessimistic.",
        "Major institutions at home \nhad downgraded their forecasts of Taiwan’s GDP growth rate this year several times, \nand the Bank projected a negative output gap next year.",
        "By contrast, efforts to rein in \nhigh inflation had proved effective, and the Bank forecasted Taiwan’s inflation rate this \nyear to drop below last year’s 2.95%, along with a further decline to less than 2% next \nyear.",
        "Against this background, a rate hold would be appropriate.",
        "One board director commented on Taiwan’s inflation.",
        "As the index of import prices \ndeclined both in USD and in NTD terms, the pressures of imported inflation abated.",
        "In \naddition  to  downtrends  in  the  annual  growth  rates  of  the  CPI  and  the  core  CPI,  the \nleading indicators for core inflation were also easing according to the Bank’s research.",
        "Therefore, it would be appropriate to keep the policy rates unchanged.",
        "Notwithstanding \nthe gradual slowdown in the inflation rate, persistent inflation remained a concern, and \nit is crucial to continue monitoring how long the CPI annual growth rate would come \ndown below 2% since this would affect the anchoring of inflation expectations; it is also \nimportant for monetary policy actions to be taken when necessary.",
        "Moreover, although \nTaiwan’s inflation rate was not as high as those of the US and the UK, close attention \nshould be paid to the fact that real earnings registered negative growth.",
        "In addition, given \nthat  changes  in  rental  costs  usually  lag  behind  housing  prices,  the  effect  of  further \nhousing price rises on rent and, in turn, on the CPI inflation requires monitoring.",
        "The \ninflation rate was currently above 2% and forecasted to come down to below 2% next \nyear.",
        "However,  if  that  forecast  does  not  materialize  next year,  which  might  be \nattributable  to  insufficient  monetary  tightening,  then  it  would  probably  call  for  more \naggressive tightening actions.",
        "One board director stated that the domestic business outlook indicators pointed low \nbut the labor market and domestic demand were steady given the increases in the number \nof employed persons and sales of retail and food/beverage businesses.",
        "The inflation rate, \nalbeit higher than expected, continued with a  gradual downtrend.",
        "Exports and  private \ninvestment  contracted  this  year  mainly  owing  to  the  impact  of  aggressive  monetary \ntightening by major central banks, but were expected to rebound to positive growth once \nthe tightening cycle of major economies ends next year.",
        "In view of this assessment, it \nwould be appropriate not to raise the policy rates.",
        "Price changes in the CPI components \nshowed upward and downward swings in vegetables and services prices, but overall the \nCPI  annual  growth  rate  gradually  came  down.",
        "Nevertheless,  given  the  absence  of \ndeclines  in  rent  and  food-away-from-home  prices,  persistent  inflation  remained  a \nconcern that requires continuous monitoring in the longer term.",
        "Another board director expressed support for the rate hold proposition and concerns \nabout rent hikes.",
        "Since rent increases tend to show downward price stickiness and could \nin turn push up overall prices, it would be important to stay alert to inflation risk next \nyear  and  to  continue  monitoring  for  persistent  inflation.",
        "Public  views  of  inflation  are \nlargely shaped by how they perceive the levels of prices of goods, especially those they \nfind more relevant to daily lives such as staples bought at least once a month; and when \nsuch prices stayed at elevated levels in spite of a downtrend in the annual growth rates, \nthe  public  would  still  be  acutely  conscious  of  price  surges.",
        "Whether  this  perception \nwould affect consumer expectations of inflation is worth close attention.",
        "One board director noted that data on the fundamentals indicated a steady domestic \neconomy but there remained sluggish growth and slackening manufacturing momentum.",
        "The National Development Council’s Monitoring Indicators improved in September and \npointed  to  a  recovery.",
        "However,  exports  still  saw  tepid  recovery  momentum  as  final \ndemand  remained  suppressed  by  a  dim  global  economic  outlook,  while  domestic \nconsumer spending was not sufficiently strong.",
        "With domestic inflation broadly on the \nwane and major central banks such as the Fed and the ECB staying put, a rate hold in \ntoday’s Meeting was warranted.",
        "The director also pointed out the importance to monitor \nthe  cumulative  effect  of  the Fed’s tightening, the lags of monetary policy, and their \neconomic and financial implications.",
        "In addition, China’s economy was confronted by \na weakening housing market, significant overcapacity, and labor surplus, which calls for \nattention to its financial conditions and local debt risk next year.",
        "Another board director stated that Taiwan still registered negative real interest rate \nand  hopefully  the  forecasted  disinflation  would  materialize  next  year  so  that  the  real \ninterest rate would turn positive.",
        "The Bank’s monetary policy decisions next year would \ndepend on how inflation moves and could tighten further if warranted.",
        "One board director gave the opinion that Taiwan’s economic growth experienced \nrather  languid  momentum  and  expanded  at  a  relatively  slow  pace,  while  inflation \nseemed to have gradually stabilized.",
        "The Fed did not raise the federal funds rate in its \nlatest  meeting  (December  13,  2023).",
        "In  addition,  this  Board  decided  to  hold  rates \nunchanged  in  September  even  as  the  economic  and  financial  conditions  were  more \nstringent than the current environment.",
        "Given the importance of consistency in interest \nrate policy decisions and their announcement effect, combined with the above \nassessments, the director supported today’s rate hold proposition.",
        "One board director agreed with the rate hold and noted that some external views of \ninflation  and  inflation  expectations  for  2024  were  higher  than  the  Bank’s  own \nprojections.",
        "This would thus warrant attention to the increasing importance of the role \ninflation expectations plays in the Bank’s policy decision-making.",
        "One board director expressed support for a rate hold, noting that recent data and \ninformation  suggested  an  easing  in  the  inflation  rate  and  strengthening  in  economic \nactivity next year.",
        "However, future inflation trends could face greater risk from supply-\nside factors, as issues of the retreat of globalization, an aging society, and labor shortage \nhold an increasingly stronger sway over the inflation rate.",
        "The effect of such structural \nfactors on prices warrants attention and the implications for the policy rates also need to \nbe taken under review.",
        "The board directors decided unanimously to keep the discount rate, the rate on \nrefinancing  of  secured  loans,  and  the  rate  on  temporary  accommodations \nunchanged at 1.875%, 2.25%, and 4.125%, respectively.",
        "Since the Board  met  in September this  year, the effects  of the  previous  substantial \ntightening  in  monetary  policy  by  major  central  banks  have  gradually  materialized.",
        "The global manufacturing sector has remained subdued, while the services sector has \nsoftened.",
        "In  addition,  prices  of  crude  oil  and  other  commodities  have  dropped  in \nrecent months.",
        "Against such a background, inflation rates of most major economies \nhave displayed a drastic downtrend from their peak levels, whereas core inflation rates \nhave  eased  at  a  mild  pace.",
        "As  the  effects  of  monetary  policy  tightening  would \ncontinue  to  work  through  the  economy,  international  institutions  projected  broadly \nsofter growth momentum for major economies in 2024, coupled with slower global \neconomic growth than this year and a continuous decline in global inflation.",
        "Recently,  major  central  banks  in  the  US  and  Europe  maintained  policy  rates \nunchanged.",
        "Market investors expected that the US and European countries' rate hike \ncycle has nearly come to an end and they would possibly start to reduce policy rates \nnext  year.",
        "Meanwhile,  the  long-term  government  bond  yields  in  major  economies \ndeclined, the US dollar index fell from its peak levels, and major currencies broadly \nappreciated against the US dollar.",
        "Looking ahead, a string of factors such as how long major central banks' interest rates \nstay  high,  China's  economic  slowdown,  global  economic  fragmentation,  and  the \nreshuffling  of  global  supply  chains  could  weigh  on  the  momentum  for  global \neconomic recovery.",
        "Moreover, geopolitical risks and climate change could also add \nto uncertainties over global inflation trends.",
        "Although global final demand remained weak, Taiwan's exports gained \nmomentum  from  accelerating  progress  in  emerging  technology  applications \nsuch as artificial intelligence.",
        "In respect of domestic demand, private \nconsumption recorded solid growth thanks to resurging post -pandemic \ndemand  for  domestic  travel  and  dining,  but  private  investment  remained \nsluggish  as  capital  equipment  imports  still  exhibited  negative  growth.",
        "The \nBank  forecasted  the  annual  GDP  growth  rate  to  be  1.40%  this  year  (see \nAppendix  Table  1  for  the  forecasts  by  major  institutions).",
        "Meanwhile,  the \nlabor market recorded a further gain in the number of employed persons and \na decline in the unemployment rate in recen t months.",
        "For  the  outlook  of  next  year,  a  rebound  in  global  goods  trade  growth  as \nprojected by international institutions and the continuous boom in emerging \ntech applications would likely bolster growth in Taiwan's exports and private \ninvestment.",
        "In addition, it was expected that private consumption would grow \nmoderately  and  government  consumption  would  increase  further.",
        "Based  on \nthese  considerations,  along  with  a  lower  base  of  GDP  growth  this  year,  the \nBank forecasted that the economy would expand faster  at a pace of 3.12% in \n2024.",
        "In  recent  months,  weather-induced  surges  in  prices  of  vegetables  and  fruit \ncaused the annual growth rate of the consumer price index (CPI) to trend back \nup  and  reached  2.90%  in  November,  whereas  the  annual  growth  rate  of  the \ncore  CPI  (i.e.,  excluding  vegetables,  fruit,  and  energy  items)  continued  to \nedge  down  to  2.38%  in  the  same  month.",
        "For  the  first  eleven  months  of  the \nyear, the annual growth rate of the CPI averaged 2.48% and that of the core \nCPI averaged 2.60%.",
        "The Bank forecasted that the annual growth rates of the \nCPI  and  the  core  CPI  would  register  2.46%  and  2.56%  in  2023,  lower  than \n2.95% and  2.61%  in  2022 (see  Appendix  Table 2 for the forecasts by  major \ninstitutions).",
        "In regard to the price trends next year, domestic commodity prices would rise \nmildly as global oil prices would likely edge higher than this year according \nto  international  institutions.",
        "In  contrast,  domestic  service  prices  would  see \nslower  price  rises  owing  to  a  higher  base  effect.",
        "The  Bank  forecasted  th e \nannual growth rates of the CPI and the core CPI to ease to 1.89% and 1.83% \nin 2024, respectively.",
        "Nonetheless, close attention should be paid to the price \ntrends  of  international  commodities  and  domestic  services  and  to  weather -\nrelated disruptions as the y carry important implications for the future path of \ndomestic inflation.",
        "Domestic  market  liquidity  was  ample  and  short  and  long -term  market  rates \nfluctuated  within  a  small  range  in  recent  months.",
        "Banks'  excess  reserves \naveraged  around  NT$54  billion  for  th e  September-October  period.",
        "For  the \nfirst  ten  months  of  the  year,  the  annual  growth  rate  of  M2  (measured  on  a \ndaily average basis) and that of bank loans and investments averaged 6.44% \nand  5.82%  respectively,  lower  than  the  7.54%  and  7.55%  recorded  in  the \nsame period last year..",
        "The Board decided unanimously to keep the policy rates on hold \nAt  the  meeting  today,  the  Board  considered  the  totality  of  economic  and \nfinancial  conditions  at home and  abroad.",
        "The domestic inflation rate would \ngradually  come  down  this  year  from  the  levels  of  last  year  and  is  expected \nto  decline  to  around  2%  next  year.",
        "Moreover,  the  domestic  output  gap  is \nestimated  to  remain  negative  next  year,  while  a  weaker  global  economy \nfacing a myriad of risks could in turn dampen Taiwan's econom ic recovery.",
        "In  this  view,  the  Board  judged  that  a  rate  hold  will  help  foster  sound \neconomic and financial development on the whole.",
        "Today, the Board decided to maintain the discount rate, the rate on \nrefinancing  of secured loans, and the rate  on temporary   accommodations at \ncurrent levels of 1.875%, 2.25%, and 4.125%, respectively.",
        "Going forward, as the recent progress in global disinflation remains clouded \nby  many  uncertainties,  the  Bank  will  stay  attentive  to  developments  in \nmonetary  policy  moves  by  major  economies,  risks  to  steeper  economic \nslowdown  in  China,  price  movements  in  global  raw  materials,  geopolitical \nrisks,  and  extreme  weather  events.",
        "The  Bank  will  assess  their  implications \nfor domestic economic activity and financial conditions and adjust its  \nmonetary policy in a timely manner as warranted, so as to fulfill the statutory \nduties  of  maintaining  financial  and  price  stability  and  fostering  economic \ndevelopment within the scope of the aforementioned objectives.",
        "The Bank has made five amendments to its selective credit control measures since \nDecember  2020,  which  have  helped  enhance  banks'  risk  management  associated \nwith real estate lending and curb an excessive flow of credit resources into the real \nestate  market.",
        "In  addition,  the  Bank's  five  policy  rate  hikes  and  two  increases  of \nreserve requirement ratios since March 2022 have further strengthened the \neffectiveness of the aforementioned selective credit control measures.",
        "Recent data \nalso suggest that growth in construction loans of all banks have continued to slow.",
        "While  housing  loans  recently  increased  faster  amid  a  rebound  in  housing  market \ntransaction  growth,  real  estate  lending  growth  has  actually  seen  a  significant \ndowntrend  since  the  selective  credit  controls  took  effect,  and  banks'  real  estate  \nlending  maintained  good  credit  quality  as  indicated  by  continuously  low  non-\nperforming loan ratio of this loan bracket.",
        "The Bank will closely monitor the likely \neffects of real estate-related policies on the housing market, keep watch on banks' \nreal  estate  lending,  review  the  outcomes  of  the  selective  credit  controls,  and  will \nmake  adjustments  as  needed  in  order  to  promote  financial  stability  and  sound \nbanking operations.",
        "The NT dollar exchange rate is in principle determined by market forces.",
        "Nonetheless,  when  irregular  factors  (such  as  massive  inflows/outflows  of  short-\nterm capital) and seasonal factors lead to excess volatility or disorderly movements \nin the NT dollar exchange rate with adverse implications for economic and financial \nstability, the Bank, in accordance with its statutory duties, will step in to maintain \nan orderly market."

    "2017": [
        "Developments since the previous Board meeting in June 2017 showed that the global recovery continued at a solid pace.",
        "International forecasting institutions slightly revised up global economic projections for 2017 and 2018 and expected next year’s performance to outpace this year’s.",
        "World trade volume growth also gained momentum from a recovering global economy, with steady growth to continue next year.",
        "Economic activity in most major economies picked up this year.",
        "As for next year, most of them are expected to grow at a slightly slower or similar pace, except for the U.S. where the economy is projected to strengthen further.",
        "Recent data pointed to mild inflation in major economies.",
        "Global inflation outlook is stable for both 2017 and 2018 according to international forecasting institutions.",
        "In the international financial markets, major currencies broadly appreciated against the US dollar and the dollar index dipped to a two-year low in early September.",
        "The euro and the Japanese yen rose against the US dollar, and most Asian currencies also strengthened.",
        "Meanwhile, the global stock markets recorded an extended rally on the back of the global economic pickup and loose monetary conditions.",
        "Key risks facing the global economy are threefold: (1) uncertainties over major economies’ policies, including the U.S. economic and fiscal policies, Brexit negotiations, and monetary tightening by the world’s main central banks (as the Fed began to reduce its securities holdings and would likely raise policy rates further, and the ECB is also expected to review its asset purchase program); (2) developments associated with trade protectionism; (3) impacts arising from geopolitical conflicts and climate change, including escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsula, a string of terrorist attacks in Europe, and disaster-related damage resulting from extreme weather.",
        "During the period since the Board last convened, Taiwan enjoyed robust export growth amidst a global economic pickup.",
        "The Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) and the Non-Manufacturing Index (NMI) both showed expansion.",
        "Nevertheless, limited wage increases and a higher base-year amount of machinery/equipment investment resulted in moderate growth in private consumption and investment, leading to a mild economic recovery.",
        "Projections by major forecasting institutions at home and abroad put Taiwan’s GDP growth rate at 2.08%-2.18% this year and 2.15%-2.27% next year, while the Bank’s own forecast is 2.15% this year and 2.20% next year.",
        "The government’s plan to raise wages for the public sector might prompt the private sector to increase wages too.",
        "With this potential positive effect on private consumption, next year’s GDP growth projection is likely to be revised up.",
        "In terms of external demand, bolstered by a stronger global economy and a lower base effect, Taiwan’s exports grew by 12.5% during the first eight months of this year.",
        "The biggest contribution came from increased exports of electronic parts and components thanks to solid global demand for semiconductors.",
        "Exports to all major destination economies, especially South Korea, China, and ASEAN, registered positive growth.",
        "The outlook for Taiwan’s exports is expected to be supported by a steady global recovery, strong semiconductor demand, and introduction of new hand-held mobile devices.",
        "However, this momentum could be slowed by uncertainties over the global economic outlook and a dissipating lower base effect.",
        "For 2017 and 2018, Taiwan’s exports are expected to post moderate growth.",
        "In regard to domestic demand, corporate profit gains translated into improvements in the labor market and cash dividends to stockholders reached a five-year high.",
        "Both were considered conducive to private consumption, though wage growth was moderate.",
        "In this view, private consumption will likely record modest growth this year and grow slightly further next year.",
        "As for private investment, business sentiment was generally positive, commercial real estate saw an increase in demand, and the government was dedicated to carrying out the Forward-Looking Infrastructure Development Program.",
        "Despite these supportive forces, capital equipment imports dropped sharply in recent months as investment in semiconductor machinery and equipment was compared against a higher base.",
        "On balance, the Bank forecast Taiwan’s private investment to grow modestly in 2017 while next year’s growth rate would be slightly lower than this year.",
        "Labor market conditions continued to improve as the number of employed persons further increased, the unemployment rate fell year on year, and the average wage posted a mild increase.",
        "In the months after June, market liquidity has remained ample, the annual growth rate of M2 has stayed within this year’s target range (2.5%-6.5%), and bank credit has expanded at a slightly slower pace.",
        "The NT dollar appreciated against the US dollar as compared to the same period last year, resulting in slightly tighter financial conditions.",
        "Nevertheless, a buoyant stock market and steady market interest rates have helped to keep the overall financial conditions accommodative.",
        "As mentioned, the domestic market interest rates have remained steady.",
        "The Bank has managed market liquidity through open market operations and kept banks’ excess reserves at an adequately accommodative level.",
        "The overnight call loan rate has also been steady.",
        "As a result of mild inflation, Taiwan’s real interest rate has returned to positive territory, whereas many major economies continued to register negative real interest rates.",
        "Assessed against economic conditions, some of those economies enjoy higher GDP growth than Taiwan while recording a relatively lower (negative) real interest rate when compared with Taiwan.",
        "The M2 annual growth rate climbed to 3.75% in August, mainly owing to firms’ inward remittances of goods sale proceeds to meet the needs of paying cash dividends.",
        "For the first eight months of the year, the M2 annual growth rate averaged 3.71%, lower than the same period last year because of a reduced amount of net foreign capital inflows.",
        "In terms of bank credit, the annual growth rate of bank loans and investments decreased slightly to 4.70% in August, mainly attributable to slower growth in bank claims on the government sector as stable gains from tax revenue weakened the need for financing.",
        "Bank loans and investment grew at an average pace of 4.68% year on year for the first eight months of the year.",
        "During the period of January to August 2017, the average annual growth rate of M2 (3.71%) and that of bank loans and investments (4.68%) were both higher than the sum of the 2017 projected GDP and CPI annual growth rates (2.95%).",
        "This indicates market liquidity conditions are sufficient in meeting the need of economic activity.",
        "Looking ahead, cross-border capital movements will likely become a major influence behind Taiwan’s M2 growth as the global outlook is still shrouded by uncertainties and the U.S. Fed will move ahead with balance sheet reduction and rate hikes.",
        "Meanwhile, demand for funds driven by the economic recovery is expected to support continued growth in bank loans and investments.",
        "The international oil prices have trended upwards since June, spurred by Saudi Arabia’s policy to cut its oil exports and a higher oil demand after the hard-hit U.S. refineries restored operations following Hurricane Harvey.",
        "Global grain prices dropped and stayed steadily low afterwards as supply exceeded demand amid favorable weather conditions in grain producer countries.",
        "Reflecting these trends, rebounding food prices have sent the domestic consumer price index to rise modestly year on year from June.",
        "The annual CPI growth rates averaged 0.72% between January and August, mainly because a slump in vegetable prices largely offset the price rises in fuel and food away from home.",
        "The average core CPI annual growth rate (excluding fruit, vegetables, and energy prices) for the same period was 0.97%.",
        "In sum, current inflation remains mild.",
        "Soft domestic demand has led the output gap, a key factor of inflationary pressures, to be negative.",
        "Therefore, inflationary pressures were contained.",
        "In this view, the forecasts made by major institutions at home and abroad suggest a mild inflation outlook for Taiwan in 2017.",
        "The medians of domestic institutions’ forecasts for 2017 and 2018 are 1.00% and 1.12%, respectively, while those of international institutions’ forecasts are 0.90% for 2017 and 1.30% for 2018.",
        "According to the Bank’s own forecasts, the CPI annual growth rate is projected to be 0.80% this year and 1.12% next year, and core CPI is expected to rise 1.04% this year and 1.13% next year.",
        "The inflation outlook remains stable.",
        "As for future determinants of price trends, sources of upside pressures include: higher cigarette prices after the recent cigarette tax hike, anticipated mild rises in global oil prices, and the minimum wage increase as well as a 3% wage hike for public sector employees from January 2018.",
        "Downside pressures might come from a still negative output gap as aggregate demand could be slightly weaker than needed amid a lukewarm economic recovery, and further reductions in telecommunication rates.",
        "Global recovery is steadily on track, but uncertainties remain.",
        "Since entering the second half of the year, both advanced and emerging market economies have experienced a steady recovery and are projected to perform better next year than this year.",
        "However, the U.S. Fed will soon begin with balance sheet normalization while the European Central Bank is about to review its asset purchase program.",
        "In addition, the U.S. economic and trade policies, trade protectionism, and geopolitical conflicts are also among the factors clouding the global economic and financial prospects.",
        "From the second half of 2017 to 2018, Taiwan’s economic growth is likely to advance with mild momentum and to remain lower than potential.",
        "Lingering uncertainties over the global economy could dampen external demand.",
        "Meanwhile, domestic demand was tepid as retail sales continued to contract in recent months, and private investment was somewhat reserved as reflected in declining capital equipment imports.",
        "The economy is expected to advance with moderate momentum in the second half of 2017 and in 2018.",
        "Current inflationary pressures and expected inflation are both mild.",
        "During the period of January to August, domestic inflation has been mild.",
        "As moderate oil price rises next year might lead to subdued global inflation expectations and soft domestic demand could also cause the output gap to remain negative, the inflation outlook is stable.",
        "Taiwan’s real interest rate has reached above zero while many major economies still register negative real interest rates.",
        "As a result of mild domestic inflation, Taiwan’s real interest rate has returned to positive territory whereas those of many major economies remain negative.",
        "Compared with Taiwan, some of these economies exhibit higher economic growth rates but lower, and negative, real interest rates.",
        "Policy Proposition: To keep the discount rate, the rate on accommodations with collateral, and the rate on accommodations without collateral unchanged at 1.375%, 1.75%, and 3.625%, respectively.",
        "All Board members approved of keeping policy rates unchanged.",
        "The discussions are summarized as follows.",
        "In respect of the international economic situation, several Board Directors and Supervisors expressed concern over how global outlook risk factors might affect Taiwan’s economic growth.",
        "One Board Director pointed out multiple uncertainties looming over the domestic economy, including trade protectionism, Sino-U.S. trade tensions, NAFTA renegotiations, Brexit talks, diverse timeframe and pace to exit quantitative easing policies by major central banks, and frequent cross-border capital movements.",
        "One Board Supervisor mentioned that trade protectionism, especially trade friction between the U.S. and China, could exert a powerful influence on Taiwan’s economy.",
        "Another Board Director further explained that considering a high proportion of Taiwanese investment in many of China’s IT giants among the primary exporters to the U.S., heightened trade protectionism could trigger trade conflicts between the U.S. and China, with possible indirect negative impact on Taiwan’s economy.",
        "With regard to domestic economic conditions, several Board Directors and Supervisors shared the view that external demand expansion contributed to a mild domestic recovery, but domestic demand remained subdued; they also expressed concerns over persistently sluggish momentum for investment growth.",
        "One Board Director pointed out that major foreign and local institutions forecast in September that Taiwan’s GDP growth rate next year would register between 2.0% and 2.5%, indicating a mild pace of expansion; therefore, it is important to continue monitoring the trend of growth while exploring ways to stimulate private consumption and investment.",
        "Another Board Director mentioned that although continued increases in export orders and export growth in recent months have given a thrust to the economy, investment indicators associated with sustained growth in the longer term showed that Taiwan’s investment growth has stayed at a low level for some time.",
        "This could afflict longer-term economic growth because faltering investment could hinder acceleration in labor productivity growth.",
        "One Board Director noted that investment growth would remain stalled if five investment challenges posed by shortages of water, electricity, labor, land, and talent are not effectively addressed.",
        "One Board Supervisor stated that among the five challenging issues, electricity shortage is a key concern that could thwart investment.",
        "Another Board Director gave the opinion that monetary policy alone cannot overcome the issue of stagnant investment; it is vital that monetary policy be accompanied by other measures, such as those alleviating shortages of electricity and water.",
        "Several Board Directors and Supervisors expressed their views on how the public sector wage increase, effective next year, would affect the economic growth.",
        "One Board Director pointed out that this measure would help drive private sector pay hikes and, in turn, prop up private consumption.",
        "One Board Director stated that based on the government’s survey results, around 20% of private corporations increase regular earnings every year regardless of economic growth; therefore, it remains to be seen whether public sector wage increase will bring forth a broader pay raise across the private sector.",
        "One Board Director also noted that the positive effect of the public sector wage increase on private consumption could be offset by a contraction effect as civil servants might tighten their purse strings on concern over reduced income post retirement following the pension reform.",
        "One Board Supervisor further noted that the public sector pay raise would have a less aggregate effect on driving consumption growth because it would be partially financed by curtailing government current spending; moreover, if a larger part of the increase in consumption goes into outbound travel or import purchases, this would mean less contribution to domestic economic growth.",
        "One Board Director expressed a similar view, saying that (outbound) travel expenditures have made up an increasingly larger share of GDP in recent years, and private consumption growth, if partially offset by growth in imports, would hardly benefit economic growth.",
        "Currently available forecasts by major institutions including the Bank have not yet taken into account the effect of next year’s public sector wage hike, which is expected to boost the 2018 GDP growth a little further.",
        "On a related note, one Board Director pointed out that there remain many uncertainties about future economic growth; public sector wage hike and stable electricity supply are both pivotal to domestic demand strength and production activity.",
        "In addition, cross-strait economic and trade developments and the effectiveness of arch government projects including Forward-Looking Infrastructure Development Program and Digital Nation and Innovative Economic Development Plan also play a key role in determining domestic growth momentum.",
        "Close attention is warranted.",
        "The Board Directors also shared their opinions about the output gap.",
        "One Board Director noted that, according to the estimated potential output growth rate based on GDP forecasts by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics as well as the Bank, the negative output gap has widened.",
        "Another Board Director mentioned that while anticipating Taiwan’s economy to grow faster next year than this year amid a bright global outlook and a gradual domestic recovery, the Bank also projects the negative output gap to widen; this calls for further in-depth study.",
        "In discussions about domestic financial conditions, one Board Director stated that the Bank has maintained banks’ excess reserves at an appropriate level, and the overnight call loan rate and the money market rate have been stable.",
        "For the first eight months of the year, the average annual growth rate of M2 stayed within this year’s target range.",
        "From June onwards, the annual growth rate of total outstanding loans and investments of monetary financial institutions has declined slightly but was still higher than the same period of the previous year.",
        "Another Board Director noted that since the beginning of the year both the stock market and the housing market have witnessed stronger trading, compared to the previous year; combined with steady market interest rates, bank lending is expected to register stable growth.",
        "The Board Directors also discussed the Fed’s decision to initiate balance sheet normalization in October and how this might affect the NT dollar exchange rate.",
        "Balance sheet unwinding will have a similar effect as raising the fed funds rate and could send the 10-year U.S. Treasury term premium higher.",
        "In this view, further US dollar strength would be on the horizon, as evident in the fact that the US dollar appreciated soon after the Fed’s announcement of the asset reduction plan.",
        "If the US dollar does strengthen, this might help ease upward pressures on the currency value of the NT dollar.",
        "In the assessment of major factors on which monetary policy deliberation is based, including domestic inflationary pressures, economic growth, financial conditions, and the real interest rate, several Board Directors expressed the view that against a backdrop of mild inflationary pressures and inflation outlook, lingering uncertainties over economic and financial trends, a widening negative output gap, and a higher real interest rate compared to many major economies, keeping the policy rates unchanged is the appropriate decision.",
        "One Board Director pointed out particularly that while the government is promoting investment in Taiwan and tackling youth unemployment, a rate hike might constrain private consumption, offsetting the benefit of the upcoming public sector wage increase.",
        "In order to help move the moderate economic growth towards further expansion, it is appropriate to maintain the current policy rate level.",
        "Another Board Director expressed a similar view that, in the context of a gradual recovery next year and insufficient momentum for private consumption and investment, it is even more important to maintain a stable financial environment while the government is pressing ahead with expansionary fiscal stimulation.",
        "A neutral policy stance where the policy rates remain at the same level would also conform to public expectations.",
        "One Board Director showed support for maintaining the current policy rate level, saying that caution is warranted as central banks of Taiwan’s major trading partners, as well as main export competitors including South Korea, also held rates unchanged at the juncture where another Fed rate hike is expected near the end of the year.",
        "Based on the assessment of domestic and international economic and financial conditions and prospects, the Board Directors all expressed approval of keeping policy rates unchanged.",
        "Board members reached a unanimous vote to keep the discount rate, the rate on accommodations with collateral, and the rate on accommodations without collateral unchanged at 1.375%, 1.75%, and 3.625%, respectively.",
        "Since the Board met in late June this year, advanced economies and emerging market economies have both been recovering at a steady pace.",
        "International institutions have revised up global GDP growth forecasts for 2017 and expect the global economy to perform better next year than this year.",
        "However, the US Fed is about to initiate the balance sheet normalization program, while the ECB may also review its asset purchase scheme.",
        "In addition, the US economic and trade policies, the rise in trade protectionism, and geopolitical tension will all add to the risk to the global economic and financial outlook.",
        "Since mid-2017, solid global economic growth has driven up exports.",
        "With regard to domestic demand, private consumption recorded limited growth, while declining capital equipment imports reflected the fact that firms were cautious about investment.",
        "The CBC forecasts that, in the second half of the year, Taiwan's economy will expand at an annual rate of 1.93%, slower than the first half year's 2.39%.",
        "For the year as a whole, the economic growth projection is 2.15%.",
        "Export growth is likely to benefit from a firming global economy next year.",
        "Meanwhile, the government rolled out the Forward-Looking Infrastructure Development Program to help bolster domestic demand with infrastructure spending.",
        "As a result, the CBC forecasts the domestic economy to advance by 2.20% for 2018.",
        "Recently-announced pay rise for public sector employees next year may also encourage private enterprises to follow suit, contributing to higher private consumption.",
        "This may help the domestic economy to register stronger growth than projected.",
        "Labor market conditions improved further and employment increased continuously, with the services sector accounting for a larger increase than others.",
        "For the first seven months of the year, the unemployment rate averaged 3.76%, decreasing by 0.15 percentage points compared to the same period last year.",
        "From June onwards, on account of the rebound in domestic food prices, the CPI annual growth rate displayed a mild uptrend and reached 0.96% in August.",
        "For the first eight months of the year, the CPI annual growth rate averaged 0.72%.",
        "Core inflation (excluding vegetables, fruit, and energy items) recorded an average annual growth rate of 0.97%, indicating mild price rises.",
        "The CBC forecasts CPI and core inflation for 2017 to rise 0.80% and 1.04% year on year, respectively.",
        "Looking ahead to 2018, in the context of stabilizing international oil prices, subdued global inflation expectations, moderate domestic demand, and the output gap remaining negative, the CBC projects the annual growth rates of CPI and core CPI for 2018 to be 1.12% and 1.13%, respectively, reflecting a stable inflation outlook.",
        "The CBC has continued to conduct open market operations to manage market liquidity.",
        "In the months from June to August, banks' excess reserves remained well sufficient.",
        "For the first eight months of the year, M2 and bank loans and investments posted average annual growth rates of 3.71% and 4.68%, respectively.",
        "This suggests that domestic financial conditions have been adequately accommodative and there is ample market liquidity to support expansions in corporate and household spending.",
        "Since the Board last convened, the NT dollar has strengthened slightly against the US dollar, the interbank overnight call loan rates have held steady, and government bond yields have trended down.",
        "While many countries registered negative real interest rates, Taiwan has seen its real interest rate return to positive territory (see Appendices 1 and 2).",
        "In sum, uncertainties over the global economic outlook still weigh on external demand; domestic demand is mild, and economic growth, though projected to pick up at a moderate pace in the second half of this year and next year, would still run below potential.",
        "Meanwhile, the real interest rate has risen above zero, and both current inflation and inflation expectations stay anchored.",
        "Against this backdrop, the Board judged that a policy rate hold is conducive to financial stability and economic recovery.",
        "The Board reached the following decision unanimously at the Meeting today:\nThe discount rate, the rate on accommodations with collateral, and the rate on accommodations without collateral are kept unchanged at 1.375%, 1.75%, and 3.625%, respectively.",
        "The CBC will continue to closely monitor the latest developments in both actual and expected inflation, output gap, and other international and domestic economic and financial conditions.",
        "We will undertake appropriate monetary policy actions accordingly in an attempt to fulfill the central bank’s statutory mandate.",
        "In principle, the NT dollar exchange rate is determined by market forces.",
        "If irregular factors (such as massive inflows or outflows of short-term capital) lead to excess volatility and disorderly movements in the NT dollar exchange rate with adverse implications for economic and financial stability, the CBC will, in line with its mandate, step in to maintain an orderly market so as to ensure economic and financial stability."

    "2019": [
        "Since the Board last convened in December 2018, a number of major concerns, including lingering uncertainty over the US trade policy, a slowing China economy, and possible extension of Brexit deadline, had led major international forecasting institutions to revise down their projections for the global economic growth and to predict a slower pace this year than last.",
        "In the meantime, trade tension among major economies had weighed on global trade growth momentum.",
        "As a result, world trade volume was forecast by international institutions to rise slower this year than last year.",
        "Forecasts for this year’s growth in major economies were also revised down by international institutions on account of cooling economic and trade activity across the world; for Taiwan’s primary trading partners, their growth this year would likely be slower than last year.",
        "Meanwhile, international institutions expected that global inflation and inflation in most economies would be weaker than last year, citing a sluggish global economic prospect and a projected downtrend in international oil prices.",
        "Overall, the global inflation outlook was expected to be mild for the year.",
        "In terms of monetary policy developments overseas, central banks in advanced economies had kept policy rates unchanged in the year so far, albeit showing a more dovish turn in general.",
        "The US Federal Reserve (Fed) decided to hold the policy rate steady on March 20, along with a plan to end the balance sheet runoff in September.",
        "The European Central Bank (ECB) said it would begin a fresh round of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO-III) in September to stimulate bank lending.",
        "The Bank of Japan (BoJ) also made no change in its easy policy stance.",
        "Despite a rate hold, the People’s Bank of China cut reserve requirements for all banks to keep credit conditions accommodative.",
        "Meanwhile, other economies in Asia either maintained or reduced their policy rates.",
        "In the international financial markets, yields on 10-year government bonds of major economies fell on account of a dovish shift by major central banks and a dimmer global economic outlook.",
        "Global stock markets bounced back from the low in the fourth quarter of 2018, on the back of the aforementioned dovish turn, positive developments in US-China trade talks, and a marked easing in US financial squeeze.",
        "Key risks to the global economic outlook include the following.",
        "Persistently high uncertainty over major economies’ trade policy: US-China trade talks are about to move towards conclusion with the final deal yet to be signed; the US will also open new battle fronts in trade with the European Union and Japan, where automobile tariffs, if imposed by the US on the EU and Japan, could trigger renewed tension.",
        "Sharper-than-expected slowdown in China’s economy: as the negative impact of US tariffs began to show, China could witness subdued growth in investment, consumption, and exports; spillovers from a sharper slowdown or financial instability in China could batter global economic growth and commodity markets.",
        "Brexit uncertainty and geopolitical tension: still a great deal of uncertainty surrounding Brexit and a potential oil supply disruption from Venezuela’s political crisis could incur additional risks to the global economic prospects.",
        "In January, though the domestic business climate monitor improved from a blue light to a yellow-blue light, both leading and coincident indicators continued sliding downwards, reflecting a domestic economic downturn.",
        "The manufacturing inventory ratio climbed higher in January, pointing to a higher risk of economic contraction.",
        "Moreover, the ratio rose further thereafter, a sign that economic growth could weaken in the future.",
        "With the global economy cooling, domestic exports falling short of expectation, and economic growth losing steam, the Bank now projected the annual GDP growth rate to be 2.13% in 2019, a downward revision of 0.20 percentage points from its December 2018 forecast.",
        "In terms of external demand, the global economic slowdown and US-China trade friction combined to drag export growth in major Asian economies, including Taiwan, into negative territory for the Jan.-Feb. period.",
        "Taiwan’s exports contracted by 4.1% in value terms, with export prices falling by 4.5% and export volume rising by a modest 0.4%.",
        "By product groups, most of the leading groups registered negative growth, except for information, communications & audio-video products, and electrical machinery products.",
        "By destination market, the decline in exports to China had the greatest impact.",
        "In view of expected sluggishness in global economic and trade growth, as well as a flattening in consumer expenditures on mobile devices, the Bank forecast Taiwan’s real export growth to moderate this year.",
        "With respect to domestic demand, investment in machinery equipment and R&D would continue expanding.",
        "Meanwhile, the government rolled out measures to encourage more overseas Taiwanese businesses to invest back at home, along with the ongoing efforts under the Forward-looking Infrastructure Development Program.",
        "These would combine to bolster investment by public and private sectors alike.",
        "Therefore, real growth in private investment was projected by the Bank to gain stronger momentum this year.",
        "In terms of private consumption, labor market conditions were stable, the unemployment rate edged down further, and the number of employed persons increased steadily.",
        "Furthermore, consumer spending is likely to be boosted by several favorable factors, including stronger prospects for pay raises as firms garnered better profits last year and incentives for shopping with government subsidies on energy-efficient home appliances and domestic tourism.",
        "However, recent signs of subdued growth momentum could dampen the willingness for hiring in the coming months.",
        "Overall, the Bank expected this year’s real growth in private consumption to be mild.",
        "With public and private investment expected to grow faster than last year and private consumption to expand steadily, domestic demand would continue to be the main driving force behind this year’s economic growth.",
        "The Bank judged that a positive impetus from domestic demand and a lower base effect would enable Taiwan’s pace of economic expansion to pick up quarter by quarter in 2019, albeit not as fast as 2018 on a yearly basis.",
        "Forecasts by major institutions for this year’s economic growth were also lower than last year, ranging between 2.00% and 2.27%.",
        "Earlier in the year, as demand for funds built up ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays, the Bank managed market liquidity in response through open market operations.",
        "Excess reserves in the banking sector were kept at a higher level, increasing from over NT$40 billion of the previous quarter to a level higher than NT$50 billion on average for the Jan.-Feb. period.",
        "As for short-term market rates, notwithstanding a higher demand for funds before the Lunar New Year holidays, market liquidity was still ample thanks to net foreign capital inflows.",
        "As of late, with currency in circulation flowing back to the banking system, short-term market rates dropped slightly.",
        "Compared to several key economies, Taiwan’s real interest rate (adjusted for inflation) stood around the middle of the range.",
        "Looking at the money supply, for the first two months of the year, M2 growth averaged at 3.03%, within the Bank’s target range.",
        "The annual growth rate of bank loans and investments averaged 5.70% for the same period as bank lending to private enterprises continued increasing.",
        "These data suggested that market liquidity was sufficient to support real economic activity and that inflationary pressures were muted.",
        "For the year as a whole, it is expected that bank loans and investments will post mild growth.",
        "In spite of projections for slower domestic economic growth and multiple uncertainties over the economic outlook, government actions, including those under the Forward-looking Infrastructure Development Program and measures to encourage returning investment by overseas Taiwanese firms, are likely to fuel growth in bank credit.",
        "Since the start of the year, international oil prices recovered ground from previous lows.",
        "However, in addition to a slowing global economy, the continuous rise in US oil production would probably balance out the effect of production cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.",
        "Therefore, it was expected that international oil prices would register an average level lower than the previous year.",
        "As for global grain prices, there has been a downward swing since February.",
        "Against this backdrop of easing price trends for international commodities, domestic inflation was moderate.",
        "With vegetable prices falling on the back of stable weather conditions, communications rates decreasing, and consumer electronics products offered at promotional prices, the annual growth rates of CPI and core CPI stayed low for the first two months of the year.",
        "In terms of the output gap, a key factor in gauging inflationary pressures, the negative gap is expected to widen marginally owing to domestic economic moderation this year.",
        "For this year, the Bank forecast the CPI and core CPI annual growth rates to be 0.91% and 0.78%, respectively.",
        "The forecast was based on expectations of abating pressures of imported inflation owing to lower-than-2018 international oil prices, a hold on domestic electricity price hikes, mild domestic demand, and the receding of the tobacco tax hike effect.",
        "The medians of domestic and international institutions’ 2019 inflation forecasts are 0.91% and 0.90%, respectively.",
        "Looking ahead, key determinants of future price trends include upside pressures from the following: last year’s price decline for fruit and vegetables owing to abundant supply is likely to result in a steeper increase in food prices this year; the base wage hike this year would drive upwards employee pay and prices for away-from-home food; coach bus fares would be raised from March onwards.",
        "On the other hand, downside price pressures could come from a projected downtrend in international oil prices compared to last year, further reductions in communications rates, and a still negative output gap.",
        "International institutions recently revised down their forecasts for global economic and trade growth this year.",
        "Major economies would be facing slower economic growth.",
        "There remain many uncertainties over international economic, trade, and financial prospects, including the lack of clarity in future developments of US trade policy towards China, Europe, and Japan, China’s economic downturn, and possible extension of Brexit deadline.",
        "Inflationary pressures would be mild, given a slight moderation in the domestic economy and still below-potential output.",
        "For the year of 2019, the Bank projected the economy to expand mildly by 2.13% and inflation to rise 0.91%.",
        "In recent months, major central banks kept policy rates unchanged while assuming more accommodative stances.",
        "Furthermore, Taiwan’s nominal and real interest rates were still around the middle range compared to selected economies.",
        "Policy Proposition: To keep the discount rate, the rate on accommodations with collateral, and the rate on accommodations without collateral unchanged at 1.375%, 1.75%, and 3.625%, respectively.",
        "Board members reached a unanimous vote for policy rates to remain unchanged.",
        "The discussions are summarized as follows.",
        "Discussion on domestic and international economic and financial conditions\nIn respect of the external environment, one board director noted that since the end of February international forecasting institutions and investment banks have actually adjusted their views on the global economic outlook given the Fed’s rate hike pause and a milder-than-expected slowdown in China thanks to Beijing’s massive stimulus measures.",
        "In fact, we have begun to see since mid-March that some foreign analysts said they expected global economic prospects to brighten in the second quarter or the latter half of the year.",
        "In light of these shifts, it remains to be seen whether a deeper domestic downturn would materialize as previously projected.",
        "Another board director stated that the expectation of a slowdown in not only world trade but also global investment this year suggested the corporate sector was worried about future business prospects.",
        "A series of uncertainties have sowed the seeds of this concern, including the US-China trade conflicts, which are not merely some transitory events but represent fundamentally a contest for technological dominance.",
        "In addition, if the Brexit deadline were to be extended till June, the concomitant effects would carry on for an even longer period.",
        "The influence on the global and domestic economy arising therefrom also needs to be closely monitored.",
        "In respect of domestic economic conditions, several board directors discussed the issue of domestic investment growth momentum.",
        "One board director pointed out that, given the scale of Taiwan’s investment in and merchanting trade (particularly intermediate goods trade) with China over the years since 2000, we are highly integrated into the global value chain.",
        "As the US-China trade friction could shake up global supply chains along the way, opportunities might also rise for Taiwan.",
        "In the past year, the government not only held meetings but also launched an action plan to encourage overseas Taiwanese businesses to invest at home.",
        "These efforts are expected to spur real investment by the returning Taiwanese firms, especially in the area of start-ups.",
        "In turn, such real investment could help address Taiwan’s long-running excess saving, raise productivity, and shore up wages, which would all be conducive to Taiwan’s economic growth.",
        "Another board director noted that projections for investment supported the view that Taiwan’s economic growth in the second half of the year would outpace that in the first half.",
        "For instance, private investment is forecast to expand faster in the coming three quarters (from the second quarter onwards) than last year, and the government’s Forward-looking Infrastructure Development Program is also expected to propel growth in public and private investment this year.",
        "Nonetheless, an export-oriented economy like Taiwan should also consider potential headwinds in the broader environment, such as a global investment slowdown, and take careful counteractions as needed.",
        "One supervisor gave an opinion on domestic economic growth and noted that although falling export prices (in NT dollars) – deteriorating terms of trade – led to a weak performance in Taiwan’s exports, data based on real export volume showed modest growth in the Jan.-Feb. period.",
        "This supervisor also pointed out that domestic economic growth was not as slow as perceived by the public, let alone recessionary.",
        "One of the most popular definitions of a recession is two consecutive quarters of decline in the seasonally-adjusted annual rate (SAAR) of GDP growth.",
        "In contrast, Taiwan’s economy is forecast by multiple domestic institutions to register positive, close to 2% SAARs in all the quarters this year.",
        "With regard to domestic prices, one board director stated that inflation was quite low in the first quarter of 2019 and was expected to stay at a lower level for the year as a whole.",
        "Another board director noted that, compared to last year’s significant increase, crop production per unit of harvested area is expected to decrease this year.",
        "Combined with the growth-dampening effect of a warm winter at the start of the year, food prices are likely to pick up.",
        "However, this would only have a limited influence on the overall inflation rate.",
        "All board directors favored no change to the current levels of policy rates, based mainly on the assessment of domestic economic moderation.",
        "One board director gave the reason that, with economic momentum weaker than last year, it is warranted to continue with the accommodative monetary policy in order to support funding needs, particularly those of small- and medium-sized enterprises.",
        "Another board director stated that a widened output gap, which indicated deficient growth momentum and subdued inflation, and the likely year-long pause of rate hikes by the Fed gave little ground for Taiwan to raise policy rates.",
        "One board director remarked that while economies around the world, including Taiwan, were experiencing some slowdown and uncertainties abounded for the global economic outlook, caution would be in order and, therefore, a ‘wait and see’ approach to the domestic policy rates would be warranted.",
        "Another board director mentioned that the Bank’s previous rate cut cycle spanned about one year, namely from the third quarter of 2015 to the second quarter of 2016, with four consecutive reductions in response to domestic economic doldrums, even negative growth.",
        "By contrast, domestic institutions already pointed out that, despite a slowdown in general, there is a likelihood for the economy to pick up gradually from quarter to quarter this year, underpinning the rate hold proposition.",
        "Furthermore, many economies had kept rates unchanged or continued with policy easing since the fourth quarter last year as they experienced slowdown in varying degrees.",
        "This board director highlighted that, in accordance with the Central Bank of the R.O.C.",
        "(Taiwan) Act, the last operational objective “to foster economic development” is to be pursued “within the scope of” the other objectives, such as financial stability and sound banking operations, whereas the general public sometimes give too much weight to the Bank’s role in economic growth.",
        "Several board directors expressed support for a rate hold and commented on future deliberations about monetary policy.",
        "One board director noted that holding rates steady would suffice in the short term given the relative calmness in the current international economic and financial environment.",
        "Nevertheless, protracted low interest rates hamper the efficiency of capital allocation.",
        "It is thus important to explore potential structural impacts of sustained monetary accommodation on the economy as a whole and whether the Bank has enough wiggle room if a sharper financial recession strikes.",
        "Another board director stated that developments since the previous Board Meeting, including policy rate holds and a dovish shift in major economies, a negative domestic output gap, the prospect of gradual improvement of domestic economic growth within the year, and muted inflationary pressures at home, suggested no need to reduce policy rates for the time being.",
        "However, going forward, it is vital to identify what policy tools the Bank can use to counter future uncertainties such as a financial crisis.",
        "One board director expressed the view that the Bank’s main policy rate, i.e., the discount rate, has had a signaling effect, albeit with limited power towards market interest rates and the real economy.",
        "However, that signal could be obscured given the contradiction between a downtrend in money supply, which was shown in recent declines of M2 growth, and a proposed rate hold, which is to indicate continued policy accommodation.",
        "In that connection, this board director pointed to the moves by the Fed, who began last year to review its monetary policy framework and the effectiveness of its policy instruments while also inviting inputs from outside the institution, and argued that the Fed’s reforming act merits our attention.",
        "Another board director contended that the Bank’s discount rate not only serves as a signal but also affects interest rates on deposits and loans offered by banks under the bank-based financial system in Taiwan.",
        "For instance, banks would adjust their deposit rates after the central bank’s discount rate decision is announced.",
        "Bank lending rates, including those on adjustable rate mortgages, would change in tandem.",
        "These would in turn affect macroeconomic activity including investment and consumer spending.",
        "This board director explained further in regard to M2 growth.",
        "While the Bank continued with an accommodative stance, the annual M2 growth rate has kept sliding since the second half of 2018.",
        "Whether this is transient or persistent calls for attention.",
        "In particular, it needs to be determined if the significant increase in net ETF assets in the interim affected M2 growth adversely.",
        "Nonetheless, the annual M2 growth rate has stayed within the Bank’s 2.5%-6.5% target range in recent years, implying sufficient support for domestic economic activity in normal circumstances.",
        "Indeed, the endogenous nature of M2 variations entails that M2 growth would soften in a slowing economy as bank lending is dampened, in parallel with a central bank’s accommodative stance amid an economic slowdown.",
        "In terms of monetary policy framework, it seems that decisions of other central banks to shift to a different framework or modify the existing one are usually made to address issues like ineffective policy implementation, problems not facing the Bank.",
        "Moreover, our current monetary policy framework is functioning well, having facilitated the attainment of low and stable inflation and financial stability.",
        "At present, there seems no pressing need to change the monetary policy framework except for regular review.",
        "One board director expressed support for a rate hold, citing developments in recent months, including short-term factors such as developments in the domestic economy, financial conditions such as banks’ excess reserves, and situations overseas especially those in major economies.",
        "However, it is no good news when protracted low interest rates since the 2008 global financial crisis restrict the efficacy of monetary policy via interest rate-setting.",
        "Foreign rate-setters, including those at the US Fed, have argued for raising policy rates, though the timing of such a move would need to take some short-term factors into account.",
        "Furthermore, as in the case of Japan, which has kept policy rates low since 1992, trying to achieve short-term results via low rates could backfire in the long run.",
        "In this light, it is advisable to include longer-term factors in the Bank’s monetary policy decision-making in the future.",
        "Another board director stated that there are three types of interest rate decisions, a rate cut, a rate hold, and a rate hike.",
        "While nominal interest rates in Taiwan have stayed at very low levels for a long time, too low a level close to liquidity trap territory would render a rate cut ineffective in spurring consumption and investment.",
        "Moreover, prolonged low rates could restrain options for available policy tools; it is also unusual when an interest rate-setting approach has not been as effective as intended.",
        "On the other hand, though, this is neither the right time to begin a rate hike cycle, considering the absence of an overheating risk or strong growth momentum.",
        "Excluding a cut or hike, adopting a rate hold and allowing market forces to play their roles constitutes the better option in the current environment.",
        "One board director supported a rate hold on account of considerations regarding short-term economic cycles.",
        "However, the long-term effects of protracted low interest rates on Taiwan’s economy as a whole have been unclear and should be revealed in a timely manner.",
        "It is also suggested that the Bank communicate to the public that it pays great attention to not only short-term volatility but also longer-term economic growth.",
        "Basic economics seems to indicate that low rates could harm creditors but benefit debtors, with such possible effects as creating income inequality or widening the rich-poor gap along the way.",
        "More attention is warranted to this potential risk.",
        "Another board director also commented on the issue of protracted low interest rates.",
        "First, according to the “secular stagnation” thesis by former US Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, interest rates had been declining before, not after, the 2008 global financial crisis.",
        "Meanwhile, Taiwan has recorded low nominal rates for quite some time, but its real interest rate is not one of the lowest.",
        "Some economists suggest that the reason why interest rates have stayed low for a prolonged period with adverse implications is because of insufficient investment demand to absorb all the saving available in the economy.",
        "Therefore, the fundamental solution to protracted low rates is to boost investment.",
        "Furthermore, it is the collective viewpoint of several renowned foreign economists that monetary policy is disproportionally burdened with the task of stabilizing the economy; countries with fiscal space should take more proactive action with fiscal expansion.",
        "Second, this board director continued, in a world of increased globalization, small open economies with free capital movements have their limitations in implementing interest rate policy, particularly in a low-interest rate environment, as well as in managing exchange rates.",
        "This concept could be described with the “impossible trinity” theory.",
        "On another front, Japan has adopted low policy rates for a long time but could still be slipping into the “lost 30 years.” While monetary policy (such as the BoJ’s balance sheet expansion) and fiscal policy (such as increased government spending) could be used to counter short-term economic cycles, they are not the effective cure for long-term structural diseases, which have been ailing Japan.",
        "Meanwhile, globalization makes protracted low rates a worldwide syndrome, which is not just seen in Taiwan, but many other economies elsewhere.",
        "In sum, the Bank should, in addition to heeding the possible side effects of protracted low rates, strive to resolve the root cause (such as considerable excess saving as a result of insufficient investment) behind this phenomenon.",
        "One board director, while approving of a rate hold, called for attention to the influence of capital flows.",
        "Another board director commented on Taiwan’s capital outflows, pointing out that outbound investments by insurers were massive in size and concentrated by market.",
        "If international stock and bond markets were to decline significantly, it could hit these insurers and affect domestic financial stability.",
        "It is therefore recommended that domestic insurers be encouraged to make longer-term investments at home, instead of overseas.",
        "One other board director followed up by explaining that insurers’ outbound investment is in fact due to the lack of longer-term (20-year or 30-year) financial products in the local market, to the extent that the levels of domestic interest rates, high or low, have little effect to the situation of insurer capital outflows.",
        "The solution would therefore be to guide insurers to invest more in real economic activity.",
        "In addition, given Taiwan’s large trade surplus and foreign capital inflows, small capital outflows could help let out pressures of a domestic market flush with liquidity.",
        "Liquidity utilization would also be less effective with domestic banks sitting on massive deposits yet lackluster in lending.",
        "These have all exerted downward pressures on interest rates.",
        "Monetary Policy Decision: The board directors reached a unanimous vote to keep the discount rate, the rate on accommodations with collateral, and the rate on accommodations without collateral unchanged at 1.375%, 1.75%, and 3.625%, respectively.",
        "The board directors and supervisors approved unanimously to issue the following press release in the post-meeting press conference, together with the Supplementary Materials for the Post-Monetary Policy Meeting Press Conference prepared by the Bank.",
        "Since the Board met in late December last year, global trade and manufacturing activity has continued to show signs of cooling.",
        "International institutions have widely revised down growth projections for the global economy this year, and major economies have mostly witnessed slower growth.",
        "Momentum for global economic expansion has weakened and international oil prices are expected to trend lower than last year, indicating a mild global inflation outlook.",
        "Major central banks have maintained policy rates unchanged in recent months, yet they have broadly adopted a more accommodative monetary policy stance.",
        "In addition, US-China trade negotiations are likely to achieve positive results, and global financial markets have rebounded significantly.",
        "Looking ahead, given lingering uncertainties over the US trade policies toward major economies such as China, the euro area, and Japan, a slowdown in the Chinese economy, and a possible extension of the Brexit deadline, the global economic and financial outlook remains unclear.",
        "Since the beginning of this year, softened external demand has contributed to negative growth in exports and weighed on production activity.",
        "Nevertheless, capital equipment imports have increased and the domestic stock market has rallied on the back of buoyant international stock markets, bolstering consumer confidence.",
        "The domestic economy has thus continued to register moderate growth.",
        "Labor market conditions have been stable, with employment slightly increasing and the unemployment rate modestly declining.",
        "In light of anticipated slowing in global economic and trade activity this year and a higher base last year, export growth may decelerate in 2019.",
        "However, with sustained growth in regular earnings and the government's consumption stimulus measures, private consumption is likely to grow at a steady pace.",
        "Meanwhile, as the government has proactively promoted the Forward-Looking Infrastructure Development Program and launched an action plan to welcome investments by Taiwanese companies abroad, both public and private investment will continue to expand.",
        "The Bank forecasts Taiwan's economic growth to accelerate quarter by quarter driven by domestic demand.",
        "For the entire year, the GDP growth rate is projected to be 2.13%, lower than the previous year.",
        "For the first two months of this year, the consumer price index (CPI) posted an average annual growth rate of 0.20%, and the core CPI also rose mildly by 0.41% in the same period.",
        "In terms of the inflation outlook, a lower base effect as excess supply brought down prices in fruit and vegetables is likely to result in a steeper increase in food prices this year, while a minimum wage hike is expected to boost wage growth and drive up prices in away-from-home food.",
        "On the other hand, imported inflationary pressures would be held down by lower international oil prices projected for this year.",
        "Combined with moderate domestic demand and a dissipated tobacco tax hike effect, the inflation outlook is stable.",
        "The Bank forecasts the annual growth rates of CPI and core CPI (excluding fruit, vegetables, and energy items) for 2019 to be 0.91% and 0.78%, respectively (Appendix Table 1).",
        "Early in the year, demand for funds in preparation for the Lunar New Year holidays was well met as the Bank managed market liquidity through open market operations.",
        "Banks' excess reserves climbed to a level higher than NT$50 billion on average for the first two months of the year, from over NT$40 billion of the previous quarter.",
        "Meanwhile, both long- and short-term market interest rates slipped slightly downwards in recent months.",
        "In the meantime, reserve money and the monetary aggregate M2 registered average annual growth rates of 6.78% and 3.03%, respectively, while bank loans and investments expanded by 5.70% for the same period, indicating sufficient money and credit growth to support economic activity.",
        "Recent data also pointed to satisfactory bank asset quality, with the non-performing loan ratio of domestic banks standing at 0.24% and the loan loss coverage ratio reaching a considerably healthy level of 569.56%.",
        "The overall assessment based on the above information showed that Taiwan's economy would likely grow at a somewhat slower pace this year against the backdrop of a downward revision of global GDP and trade growth forecasts and persistent uncertainties over the international economic, trade, and financial prospects.",
        "In addition, the actual output remains below potential and inflationary pressures are expected to be subdued.",
        "Moreover, Taiwan's nominal and real interest rates continue to register around the middle range among a host of economies (Appendix Figure 1 & Table 2).",
        "Therefore, the Board judged that a policy rate hold and a continued accommodative monetary policy stance will help foster sound development of the economy and the financial sector.",
        "The Board reached the following decision unanimously at the Meeting today:\nThe discount rate, the rate on accommodations with collateral, and the rate on accommodations without collateral are kept unchanged at 1.375%, 1.75%, and 3.625%, respectively.",
        "The Bank will continue to monitor inflation, economic, and financial developments at home, while paying close attention to any possible impacts on Taiwan's economy and financial conditions resulting from shifts in global economic and trade activity, monetary policy of major economies, and cross-border capital flows.",
        "We will undertake appropriate and timely actions as warranted, so as to fulfill the central bank's statutory mandate.",
        "In principle, the NT dollar exchange rate is determined by market forces.",
        "Nonetheless, if irregular factors (such as massive inflows or outflows of short-term capital) as well as seasonal ones lead to excess volatility and disorderly movements in the NT dollar exchange rate with adverse implications for economic and financial stability, the Bank will, in accordance with its mandate, step in to maintain an orderly foreign exchange market."

        "Looking at policy changes of major economies since the Bank’s last Board Meeting in June, major central banks continued with monetary easing, maintaining policy rate levels and keeping asset purchase programs in place, albeit with tapering signals from the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank.",
        "Meanwhile, major economies also remained expansionary in terms of fiscal policy.",
        "In global financial markets, government bond yields of the US and Germany climbed out of the bottom as the Fed and the ECB signaled they might reduce bond-buying amid worries about recent elevated inflation.",
        "Global equities seesawed at high levels and the US dollar index rebounded, owing to intensifying financial risks in China and an unclear path of the Fed’s tapering plan.",
        "Looking ahead, downside risks continue to loom over the global economic outlook, including uneven vaccination progress, a greater impact of new virus strains, pressures for some advanced economies to gradually withdraw monetary easing, potential disasters owing to climate change, and heightened geopolitical conflicts.",
        "If these risks materialize or intensify, they could dampen the global economic recovery and hamper financial stability.",
        "The six-month outlook subindex under Taiwan’s Manufacturing PMI pointed to further expansion, and the outlook subindex under the Non-Manufacturing Index rose back from July onwards as domestic COVID-19 cases dropped to a steady low.",
        "Both readings revealed more positive business sentiment.",
        "Regarding external demand, rising global demand and raw material prices significantly boosted export performance of major products this year, with an increase of more than 20% for exports to each major market.",
        "Greater final demand benefiting from the gradual normalization of economic activity in major economies was expected to keep Taiwan’s exports enjoying solid real growth in the second half of 2021, with significant expansion for the year as a whole before moderating next year.",
        "Regarding domestic demand, Taiwanese tech giants and related supply chain firms stepped up capital expenditure, and investment plans for 5G network technology and for maritime and air transport equipment continued to progress.",

        "In terms of private consumption, a partial lift of restrictions amid an improving pandemic situation, a new consumption stimulus program, and pent-up demand were expected to give private consumption a firmer footing in the second half of the year, with real private consumption growth advancing at a mild pace this year and gathering steam next year.",
        "In the labor market, the unemployment rate dropped to 4.24% in August, though it remained high.",

        "Short-term interest rates fluctuated narrowly as the pandemic eased, and banks’ average excess reserves stayed above NT$60 billion in recent months.",
        "Bank credit conditions were supported by extended export strength and increased policy loans to pandemic-impacted SMEs, resulting in steady growth in total bank lending and SME lending.",
        "The annual growth rate of the monetary aggregate M2 trended down in August due to a higher base effect and slower growth in transaction deposits, averaging 8.91% for the January-August period.",
        "In the housing market, the price index for new housing projects edged down in the second quarter, while the index for existing homes rose.",
        "For the first seven months of the year, the number of ownership transfers for buildings and land increased by 16.0% and 15.2% year-on-year.",

        "Data as of the end of July showed an annual increase of 11.6% in total real estate lending.",
        "Housing loan growth slowed slightly to 10.2% year-on-year, while construction loan growth rose to 17.1%, driven mainly by a 26.7% increase in land loans.",

        "International prices for crude oil and other raw materials remained elevated in August, and domestic vegetable prices soared due to torrential rain, sending the annual growth rate of the consumer price index (CPI) to 2.36%.",
        "However, this rise was attributed to transitory forces.",
        "The core CPI posted an annual growth rate of 1.33%, considered mild.",
        "The average annual growth rate of the CPI for the first eight months of the year was 1.64%, driven by increases in domestic fuel prices, airfares, and vegetable prices.",
        "Raw material price uptrends and shipping fee surges pushed up import prices and triggered imported inflationary pressures, though there were signs of moderation in recent months.",
        "September meeting of the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) still viewed that elevated inflation largely reflected transitory factors but did not completely dismiss concerns.",
        "Therefore, the Bank should also continue to closely watch domestic inflation and stay alert.",
        "Another board director stated that despite mild inflation at present, the Bank needs to heed the future path of domestic inflation and conduct more research on inflation expectations and survey methodology.",
        "The director suggested the Bank give guidance regarding the criteria necessary to warrant a rate hike to bolster public confidence in the Bank’s ability to keep inflation anchored.",
        "One board director pointed out that structural factors holding down global inflation have weakened somewhat.",
        "Though still not radical in the near term, structural changes, once set off, would have a greater effect in the coming years.",
        "Furthermore, it is important to study inflation expectations.",
        "For instance, inflation expectations of households could well overshoot actual inflation as the day-to-day shopping experience of goods and services tends to dictate public expectations of inflation.",
        "Household inflation expectations might capture the tipping point of structural changes in inflation.",
        "When the gap between headline and core inflation readings widens, often discounted as a phenomenon reflecting temporary disruptions, it could actually signal future structural inflation changes that households’ inflation expectations could capture.",
        "Several board directors gave their views on future monetary policy deliberations.",
        "One noted that, despite the impact from the pandemic, Taiwan’s economic fundamentals were stronger than many other economies.",
        "Meanwhile, the recent US FOMC meeting suggested the Fed may start to reduce asset purchases later this year and possibly raise rates as soon as next year.",
        "Against this backdrop, Taiwan, being a small open economy, should also begin to ponder over the appropriate timing of a rate liftoff to prepare for likely policy changes in advanced economies.",
        "One board director pointed out that the effect from an earlier domestic COVID-19 flare-up had not fully receded, representing a lingering downside risk to the economy.",
        "Meanwhile, inflation rose further, albeit judged to be transitory.",
        "While the current circumstances did not warrant an inflation-fighting rate hike, the Bank would need to weigh the effect of persisting low interest rates on the economy and, when the timing is right, consider the possibility of raising the policy rates.",
        "One board director remarked that domestic consumer price trends were relatively steady, and a rate hike out of step with major economies could amplify the NTD strength.",
        "On balance, it seemed the better approach would be to keep the policy rates unchanged.",
        "Perhaps the Bank could start to mull a gradual rate liftoff next year if the US Fed begins to raise rates.",
        "All board directors were in favor of adjusting the selective credit control measures.",
        "One board director pointed out that banks’ real estate lending had made up an increasingly larger share of total bank lending.",
        "Among the components, the main contributor was a growing share of construction loans due to rising land loans, whereas the share of housing loans changed modestly.",
        "As real estate developers were keen on buying more land, the ensuing land price hikes also pushed up housing prices.",
        "In this view, it would be appropriate to lower the LTV ratio ceiling for land loans.",
        "One board director stated that although Taiwan’s often-watched housing price indices showed a slower rise in the second quarter of this year, a broad uptrend persisted, justifying the adjustment proposition.",
        "Another board director noted that the “consolidated land and housing income tax 2.0” entered into force not long ago, but recent data still showed excessively high annual growth rates of building ownership transfers and land sales.",
        "The director supported the adjustment with the aim of cooling down an overheating property market but cautioned that the effectiveness of such adjustments would need further monitoring.",
        "Another board director remarked that the selective credit controls might not significantly tamp down housing prices.",
        "For instance, the current housing boom in Southern Taiwan was actually due to a favorable outlook bolstered by major investment projects such as new semiconductor plants.",
        "Two board directors noted that the Bank had adjusted the control measures twice since December 2020; they hoped this adjustment would also be well-received by the market.",
        "Another board director noted that the purpose of selective credit control is to foster a sound housing market and promote financial stability, but the public might have doubts about the effectiveness of this additional tightening, which could impair the Bank’s credibility.",
        "In the future, more thought will need to be put into how best to ensure a sound housing market.",
        "One board director gave the opinion that a progressive approach to brake gently would make the ride steadier.",
        "Moderate policy actions might not reduce housing and land prices but could still be productive by markedly reducing the pace of property price rises.",
        "In addition, the current upside pressures on housing and land prices could have been partially fueled by the low interest rate environment.",
        "The Bank tackled housing price elevation by increasing the cost and limiting the source of funds for property buyers via LTV ratio caps.",
        "Nevertheless, the most effective solution would be taxation policies, albeit not an easy path for such policy changes to happen.",
        "Another board director noted that a considerable part of the present housing price strength came from surging raw material prices and wages that fed into the cost of building and construction.",
        "Raising the policy rates while advanced economies stay put could prove futile in dampening housing prices and even detrimental to the economy.",
        "One board director pointed out that, in addition to increases seen in housing prices and housing loans, Taiwan’s household debt to GDP ratio had also gone high, with real estate purchases as the primary use of this debt buildup.",
        "If housing prices keep climbing and real estate loans keep expanding, mortgage borrowers will face even heavier debt burdens once policy rates start rising.",
        "Therefore, selective credit control would be the right way to foster a sound real estate market.",
        "Another board director expressed the view that selective credit control is not as potent and effective as other measures in cooling the housing market and needs to be deployed early for better results.",
        "Protracted monetary easing, including keeping the policy rates low, has significant implications for the housing market.",
        "Housing price rises could impact financial stability, cause resource misallocation, and militate against fair distribution of wealth.",
        "Some research found that the best way to stabilize the housing market is a mix of macroprudential measures and interest rate policy.",
        "Relying solely on interest rate adjustments to tame housing price rises could create serious problems for other sectors in the economy.",
        "Nonetheless, this does not mean the Bank should write off interest rate policy completely but consider a policy mix of macroprudential measures and interest rate adjustment when warranted.",
        "One board director noted an excessively high level of saving in Taiwan, some of which has flowed into the property market.",
        "Housing price deviations have concerned the Bank mainly because they could indirectly affect financial stability.",
        "However, this issue also involves housing justice, resource allocation, etc., requiring concerted cooperation to fight the battle on various fronts of supply, demand, and system.",
        "Introducing a rate hike and selective credit control simultaneously makes sense, but many factors must be considered when deciding the timing and appropriate policy tools.",
        "For instance, a rate hike could add to the current NTD  strength; if  combined with selective credit control adjustments, such \npolicy tightening could be packing too hard a punch.",
        "The Bank’s policymaking cannot and does \nnot aim for an all-around solution but seeks to reach the best possible policy balance given the \nmany factors at play.",
        "Monetary  Policy  Decision:  The  board  directors  reached  a  unanimous  vote  to  keep  the \ndiscount rate, the rate on refinancing of secured loans, and the rate on temporary \naccommodations unchanged at 1.125%, 1.5%, and 3.375%, respectively, and to adjust the \nBank’s selective credit control measures.",

        "To achieve the goals of effective allocation and proper use of credit resources as outlined \nin  the  government's  Healthy  Real  Estate  Market  Plan,  the  Bank  made  two  successive \namendments  in  December  2020  and  March  2021  to  its  selective  credit  control  measures.",
        "Though the amended Regulations Governing the Extension of Mortgage Loans by Financial \nInstitutions  have  brought  down  the  loan-to-value  (LTV)  ratios  of  those  loans  regulated, \nbanks have continued witnessing marked increases in real estate lending.",

        "In\n\nterms of overall price trends since October, international raw material prices first trended up\n\nbefore falling down amid price fluctuations for crude oil and other commodities.",
        "In terms of inflation, major economies were forecasted to witness higher inflation rates in\n\n2021 compared to 2020, driven by supply-demand imbalances during the pandemic and the\n\neconomic recovery therefrom.",
        "As the imbalance issue and elevated energy prices – expected to\n\ncontinue into the first half of 2022 – would likely ease afterwards, international institutions\n\nprojected a gradual decline of inflation by the end of 2022, with the inflation rate for the year\n\nas a whole to register slightly higher than 2021.",
        "Since the Board last met in September 2021, the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) had tapered\n\noff bond buying, and the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan had maintained a\n\nbroadly loose monetary policy stance.",
        "In terms of global financial markets since October 2021, the 10-year government bond yields of major economies broadly trended upwards as the international oil price rises pushed\n\nup inflation expectations, before trending downwards from recent highs owing to the new\n\nvariant’s potential threat to the economy.",
        "In recent months, strong earnings reported by U.S.\n\nand Europeans firms, the possibility of the Fed tapering faster, and the fear for a wider pandemic\n\noutbreak owing to new virus strains combined to paint a mixed picture that resulted in volatile\n\nupswings in the global stock markets.",
        "Meanwhile, the US dollar index climbed upwards on the\n\nback of the Fed’s move toward monetary policy normalization.",
        "Looking ahead, the following downside risks continue to obscure the global economic\n\noutlook: a rapid spread of new virus variants causing the global pandemic to intensify again, a further rise in inflation pressures prompting major central banks to tighten monetary policy\n\nearlier, China’s crackdowns and controls targeting several sectors that may result in a sharp\n\neconomic slowdown, and continued U.S.-China competition and heighted risks associated\n\nwith climate change.",

        "As for projections, the Bank expected to see extended growth\n\nin real exports next year on account of robust development of emerging technology\n\napplications, new capacity for advanced semiconductor production, and increased production\n\nin Taiwan as firms re-distribute production plans.",
        "Regarding domestic demand, as Taiwanese tech giants and related supply chain firms\n\nexpanded capacity and many manufactures continued to spend on equipment that would help\n\nreduce carbon footprint, private investment would sustain its growth momentum.",
        "Considering\n\nthe above benefits and a higher base effect, the Bank projected that real private investment\n\nwould grow at a mild pace next year.",
        "Regarding private consumption, domestic COVID-19\n\ncontainment policy was eased, government measures to boost consumption were launched, and\n\nbusiness in the services industry – a domestically oriented sector – gradually rebounded.",

        "Looking at the annual growth rate of the monetary aggregate M2, the uptrend in the first\n\nfew months of this year broadly moderated from June onwards.",
        "During the Jan.-Oct. period,\n\nthe average annual growth rate of M2 was 8.84%, higher than the upper boundary of the\n\nreference range.",
        "This was mainly because bank loans and investments, bolstered by solid\n\neconomic fundamentals, continued to register strong growth and foreign investment in Taiwan\n\nexhibited a net capital inflow.",
        "Considering that growth momentum for the domestic economy is likely to soften slightly\n\nnext year, and bank loans and investments already came to elevated levels, the Bank expected\n\nthe annual growth rate of M2 would likely decrease as a result of a higher base effect.",
        "In\n\naddition, the estimation of the money demand function showed that the growth rate of demand\n\nfor M2 is likely to range between 2.5% and 6.5% next year, consistent with the reference range\n\nused by the Bank.",
        "Given that the M2 reference range serves as a mid- to long-term indicator,\n\nthe Bank judged that it would be appropriate to maintain the current range.",
        "The Bank will continue to monitor any changes in the M2 growth trends.",

        "Recently, some of the goods with a higher consumption frequency, such as staple goods\n\nand food and beverages, had experienced price hikes, triggering a more acute sense of price\n\ninflation among consumers.",
        "The government had already taken measures to contain\n\ndisproportionate price rises, which would help diffuse unwarranted public panic and lower\n\ninflation expectations.",
        "For the first eleven months of the year, the average annual growth rates of the CPI was\n\n1.91%.",
        "This was mainly due to rising prices of fuel and lubricants, transportation, and fruit and\n\nvegetables, with a combined contribution of 1.09 percentage points to this increase.",
        "The price\n\ninflation in the year so far was primarily attributable to supply side shocks as well as a lower\n\nbase effect.",
        "Although inflationary pressures were rising at home in the second half of the year, the\n\noverall price inflation was mild compared to the U.S. and Europe.",
        "This was mainly because of\n\nthe successful containment of the pandemic, the low incidence of logistics gridlocks and other\n\nsupply chain bottlenecks, the absence of labor market tightness, and mild growth in average\n\nnon-farm employee earnings.",
        "The average projections for Taiwan’s inflation rate in 2021 and 2022 by major forecasting\n\ninstitutions had slowly trended upwards since the beginning of 2021 but remained below 2%,\n\nindicating mild pressures of inflation.",

        "Taking into account the effects from international oil price trends and weather events, the\n\nBank estimated that the CPI annual growth rate would edge up in the fourth quarter.",
        "For this\n\nyear as a whole, the CPI and core CPI annual growth rates were projected to be 1.97% and\n\n1.31%, respectively, both mild.",
        "For next year, the Bank saw the CPI and the core CPI to rise by\n\n1.59% and 1.45% year on year, respectively, in anticipation of a softer upswing in international\n\noil prices.",
        "Meanwhile, major institutions forecasted Taiwan’s CPI annual growth rate to be 1.80%-2.04% this year and 1.10%-2.00% next year.",
        "Looking ahead, primary sources of upside price pressures include: next year’s base\n\nwage and public sector pay hike and the likely consequence of a private sector pay raise, which\n\ncould increase hiring costs and in turn feed into the prices of goods and services; further\n\nincreases in global food prices, adding to upward pressures for domestic prices of food away\n\nfrom home; unabated supply chain disruptions, which could push up the prices of certain\n\ngoods.",
        "On the other hand, downside pressures could arise when the government’s price stability\n\npolicy measures effectively reduce the pressures from higher costs and/or when communication\n\ndevices and telecom rates continue to trend low.",
        "This year’s uptrend in the annual CPI growth rate was due to supply side factors and a lower\n\nbase effect, which would likely decline next year, indicating little urgency to apply rate\n\nhikes against inflation.",
        "An uneven recovery across industries: In March 2020, the Bank reduced the policy rates in\n\norder to help domestic small and medium-enterprises (SMEs) through the pandemic’s\n\neconomic impact, but the current recovery in some services sectors remained relatively\n\nweak.",

        "The Regulations have showed effectiveness in helping\n\nbanks restrain credit risk associated with real estate lending.",

        "The cap on the LTV ratio for land loans would be lowered to 50% (40% plus the withheld\n\n10% granted after construction commences).",
        "Borrowers would also be required to commit\n\nto begin construction within a specific time frame, a rule aiming at urging them to begin\n\nbuilding work sooner so as to increase housing supply and prevent undue financing for\n\nland hoarding.",
        "The cap on the LTV ratio for unsold new housing loans would be lowered to 40%, with the\n\naim of urging developers to speed up project sales so as to increase housing supply and\n\nprevent undue financing for house hoarding.",
        "The cap on the LTV ratio for idle industrial land mortgage loans would be lowered from\n\n50% to 40%, in line with the LTV tightening (and the precondition of construction\n\ncommencement for full loan disbursement) for land loans.",
        "Policy Proposition: To keep the discount rate, the rate on refinancing of secured loans, and the rate on temporary accommodations unchanged at 1.125%, 1.5%, and 3.375%, respectively; to adjust the Bank’s selective credit control measures.",
        "Board members reached a unanimous vote to keep the policy rates unchanged and to adjust\n\nthe Bank’s selective credit control measures.",
        "Related discussions are summarized as follows.",
        "One board director noted the high uncertainty over the COVID-19 pandemic and the\n\nconspicuous gap across industries; for instance, the electronics industry was largely unscathed\n\nand some even benefited from the pandemic, whereas such sectors as food and beverages and\n\ntravel and tourism took a heavy blow.",
        "Meanwhile, rising prices of oil and of fruit and vegetables\n\nalso drove the inflation rate upwards, albeit judged to be temporary.",
        "The director therefore\n\nsupported the rate hold proposition.",
        "One board director gave two reasons for supporting a rate hold.",
        "First, the New Taiwan\n\ndollar (NTD) was relatively strong; for instance, the NTD had appreciated by 2.53% this year\n\nso far, whereas the won – the currency of one of Taiwan’s major export rivals – depreciated by\n\n8.34%, which could hamper Taiwan’s export competitiveness.",
        "Second, the seemingly robust\n\nexport expansion this year was partially attributable to some sectors emerging from the previous\n\nyear’s contraction thanks to a lower base effect.",
        "Another board director noted that, this year’s economic growth notwithstanding, there\n\nremain some risks ahead in 2022 for Taiwan.",
        "Being a small open economy, Taiwan also needs\n\nto take into account the effect of major economies’ monetary policy actions; as major central\n\nbanks mostly kept an easy monetary policy stance, the conditions were not suitable for the Bank\n\nto hike rates.",
        "In this view, the board director supported the proposed rate hold.",
        "One board director pointed out that though the Fed had begun tapering, it was expected\n\nnot to raise rates until March 2022.",
        "Given that Taiwan’s inflation was less concerning compared\n\nto the U.S. and was mainly accounted for by imported inflation, it seemed that this has yet to be the right timing for a rate hike.",
        "Moreover, hiking the rates at the current juncture could add\n\nto upward pressures on the NTD.",
        "Deliberations on inflation-related issues\n\nSeveral board directors discussed inflation expectations and shared their views on the price\n\noutlook.",
        "One of them observed that although the annual CPI growth rate was below 2% on\n\naverage for this year so far, it was running above 2% for consecutive months recently.",
        "Given\n\nthe downward stickiness of prices and a potential rise in inflation expectations owing to the\n\nnoticeable price hikes in food and beverage services recently, the inflation uptrend could be\n\neven steeper.",
        "Another board director pointed out that, despite a large basket of CPI components, the\n\npublic tend to response more strongly to the price rises in staple goods as they purchase these\n\nitems more frequently.",
        "The Bank should communicate to the public in a timely manner to\n\nprevent inflation expectations from building up.",
        "One board director noted that, with Taiwan’s inflation broadly stable for several decades,\n\nthe issue of inflation expectation has been off the Bank’s radar for a long while.",
        "Nonetheless,\n\n(inflation) expectations may influence (consumer) behavior, which in turn may influence actual\n\ninflation.",
        "If the public sentiment veers increasingly away from the Bank’s account of inflation,\n\nthis could damage the Bank’s credibility.",
        "Another board director agreed that the Bank can work on gaining better understanding of\n\ninflation expectations and inflationary pressures.",
        "As to the issue of inflation and how inflation\n\nexpectations and pressures develop, potential structural changes in the long term should also be\n\ntaken into account.",
        "For instance, green energy might replace the conventional energy form of\n\nfossil fuel, a transformation whose impact on prices deserves attention.",
        "One board director pointed out that although many institutions expected Taiwan’s inflation\n\nto moderate in 2022, it is still important to prevent the public from expecting higher prices,\n\ngiven the current low interest rate environment.",
        "In addition, as the interest rates were currently\n\nlow, rate hikes would exert only limited influence on price trends unless the hikes are aggressive\n\nenough.",
        "One board director noted that the expected decline in Taiwan’s annual CPI growth rate\n\nnext year would be due to a high base effect than otherwise.",
        "Nevertheless, the public was still\n\nuncomfortably aware of price uptrends, especially agriproducts; for example, fruit prices gained\n\nmarkedly in recent months amid unfavorable weather conditions.",
        "In addition, it was projected\n\nthat international prices of soybeans, wheat, and corn would remain high next year and could\n\nbe further pushed up by extreme weather events, which would then drive domestic prices of\n\nmeat and eggs upwards.",
        "Another board director noted that since housing rents have a large weight among the CPI\n\nbasket, attention should be paid to whether housing price rises also lead to rent increases.",
        "On\n\nthe other hand, if the pandemic eases next year, dissipating shipping gridlocks could help\n\ncontain domestic goods price rises, but the services sector (such as food and beverages, travel,\n\netc.)",
        "might experience upward pressures; it is important to keep a close watch on potential\n\neffects on future price trends domestically.",
        "One board director remarked that the government’s successful monitoring of charges for\n\nutility, public transportation, and fuel and lubricants had kept these prices mostly in check.",
        "In\n\naddition, imported inflationary pressures could also be mitigated via the commodity tax cut.",
        "As\n\na result, Taiwan’s headline inflation was mild compared to major economies.",
        "However,\n\nconsidering the effect of U.S.-China trade conflicts on low-cost goods exported by China, goods\n\nprices across countries could be prodded up.",
        "In this regard, this board director suggested the\n\nBank consider adjusting the acceptable range for the annual CPI growth rate to a band higher\n\nthan 0%-2%\n\nOne board director noted that inflation has different effects on individuals and households\n\nacross different income classes because inflation is the most regressive tax of all.",
        "Low-income\n\nindividuals/households tend to feel the most impact from inflation and are more sensitive to\n\nprice rises.",
        "Although the issue of income distribution falls outside of the Bank’s statutory\n\nmandate, its importance should not be overlooked.",
        "Several board directors discussed the considerations for and the path of future monetary\n\npolicy.",
        "One board director noted that, in addition to closely following the changes in the Fed’s\n\npolicy, the Bank should also monitor the effect of domestic consumers’ inflation expectations\n\nand the future price trends and put them into proper consideration in the next quarterly meeting\n\nand adjust the monetary policy timely as warranted.",
        "One board director noted that the Bank’s monetary policy conduct has been steady and\n\nsound; in the event of raising the policy rates, the hikes would also be at a measured pace, unless\n\notherwise warranted by excessive inflationary pressures.",
        "Should such pressures become\n\nexcessively heavy in the coming months, the Board might consider and discuss a proposition\n\nto raise the rates during the next quarterly meeting.",
        "Another board director observed that though Taiwan’s current inflation situation was not\n\nas concerning as the U.S. but, if extending the time series span, the inflation rate of the U.S.\n\naveraged above 2% in the past two decades while that of Taiwan averaged around 0.95%.",
        "For\n\nthose economies with a 2% inflation target, an overshoot of one percentage point (i.e., inflation\n\nreaching 3%) calls for close attention; likewise, Taiwan would need to heed an overshoot above\n\n2%.",
        "The suggestion for the Bank would be to plan early, assess policy effects, and promptly\n\ntake monetary policy actions when necessary.",
        "When it comes to addressing the issue of either\n\ninflation or housing prices, the Bank may need to make a bigger change to the broadly loose\n\nmonetary policy stance upheld in the past twenty years.",
        "One board director remarked that the persistent easy money conditions in Taiwan is related\n\nto ample market liquidity amid a saving glut and investment deficiency.",
        "After the global\n\nfinancial crisis, the domestic excess saving continued rising.",
        "More recently, despite a pickup in\n\ninvestment growth last year, the pandemic-led decline in consumption also caused saving to\n\nincrease faster.",
        "The Bank would need to closely monitor if excess saving grows further and take\n\nthis important factor into account when mulling the future policy path.",
        "In the future, if Taiwan’s\n\ninvestment growth sustains steady growth and the economic fundamentals are solid, a higher\n\ninflation rate might be deemed acceptable.",
        "One board director noted that the key considerations for the Bank’s monetary policy\n\nconduct may also include housing price trends in addition to inflation and economic growth.",
        "Given the domestic economic expansion under way, it seems the timing is appropriate to\n\ngradually begin monetary policy normalization, which would also help soothe housing price\n\nsurges.",
        "Another board director pointed out the important role of inflation expectations despite the\n\nmarkedly milder inflation in Taiwan than in the U.S. and argued for the need for the Bank to\n\ncommunicate well to the public that the domestic economic recovery could moderate next year,\n\nand many uncertainties remain, while supply chain bottlenecks would likely ease gradually.",
        "Such communication would help subdue inflation expectations and keep them from self\nfulfilling.",
        "Although monetary policy does not solve supply-side problems, the Bank should also\n\ncommunicate to the public about the policy tools it may use once longer-term risks of price\n\nchanges emerge.",
        "In the future, the Bank will monitor the policy changes of other central banks\n\nand the developments in international economic and financial conditions to advise quarterly\n\nreviews and respond as warranted.",
        "One board director noted that domestic consumers recently felt a sharper pain from rising\n\nprices of food and beverages, but the government already took action to stabilize prices, which\n\nwould help contain inflation expectations.",
        "In addition, Taiwan did not experience serious\n\nsupply-demand imbalances, the current inflation rate was milder than major economies, and\n\nmost forecasters also projected a decline in Taiwan’s inflation next year.",
        "Meanwhile, the Bank’s\n\nspecial accommodation facility to support the SMEs was coming to a close, whereas the\n\nservices sector lagged behind other industries amid a K-shaped recovery.",
        "Moreover, as the\n\ndomestic market already had ample liquidity, raising the policy rates could attract capital\n\ninflows and further buoy up liquidity.",
        "Therefore, future adjustments to the Bank’s monetary\n\npolicy should be made after assessing these factors, including domestic inflation outlook,\n\nrecovery of the pandemic-hit sectors, and rate increases by major economies’ central banks.",
        "Two board directors gave opinion on the fact that M2 growth had exceeded the upper end\n\nof the reference range.",
        "One board director pointed out that M2 growth still has influence on\n\nprices over the longer term.",
        "However, domestic prices kept rising and M2 growth recorded\n\nabove-reference-range growth for 15 consecutive months.",
        "Against that backdrop, and\n\nconsidering the prominent role of public inflation expectations in affecting future inflation, the\n\nBank should let the public know that it might raise the policy rates at the appropriate timing as\n\nwarranted.",
        "A rate hike would not only influence prices but would also add to mortgage interest burdens, which could cause non-performing loans to increase, presenting risks to financial\n\nstability.",
        "It is hoped that the Bank could conduct effective communication to facilitate more\n\naccurate public expectations of inflation and housing prices.",
        "Another board director stated that M2 continues to serve as an important reference for\n\nmonetary policy deliberation.",
        "Particularly, indirect finance has a dominant share in Taiwan’s\n\nfinancial system and M2 growth can provide information on bank loans and investments.",
        "As\n\nthe M2 annual growth rate had continued to overshoot the reference range this year so far, it\n\nwould be important to examine if this also reflected significant growth in bank loans, especially\n\nreal estate loans, and to find out if the Bank’s selective credit controls helped restrain the\n\nexpansion of banks’ real estate lending.",
        "Citing the recent uptrend in construction-related financing, one of the board directors\n\nexpressed support for the adjustment to reduce the LTV caps to as low as 40%, stating that the\n\ntimely tightening of selective credit controls would help restrain property speculation.",
        "Another\n\nboard director also supported the adjustment proposition and noted that given the increasingly\n\nhigher prices and trading volume in the housing market, it would certainly be warranted to apply\n\nthe brakes as seen fit.",
        "One board director remarked that despite the housing boom and considerable growth in\n\nhome prices, this might not be the right timing to tackle them with policy rate adjustments;\n\ntherefore, the Bank had to address this problem via selective credit controls.",
        "Nevertheless,\n\nconsidering the many determinants behind housing prices, it would be a tough battle to fight by\n\ndeploying only monetary policy instruments.",
        "The focus now should be to forestall undue public\n\nexpectations of future housing prices and the selective credit controls would send a clear signal\n\nto that end, hence the director’s support for the adjustments.",
        "Another board director also supported the adjustments, stating that the housing price trends\n\nat present reflected a combination of supply-side and demand-side factors and the Bank would\n\nneed to demonstrate its resolve to keep the housing market from overheating.",
        "Although the\n\nselective credit controls had achieved some results, they would still need to be accompanied by  other types of policy efforts if the housing price problem is to be successfully tackled.",
        "Such\n\npolicy measures include increasing the supply of social housing, raising the relevant tax levies,\n\netc.",
        "Multi-faceted policy actions would thus more effectively help sustain a healthy housing\n\nmarket.",
        "One board director showed support for the adjustments, mainly because the side effects on\n\nhousing prices from protracted monetary easing were increasingly distinct and it would thus be\n\nthe right direction to strengthen the clout of selective credit controls.",
        "Though the selective credit\n\ncontrols had proved effective to an extent, they could only treat the symptoms but not the\n\ndisease; the housing price malady cannot be cured without a targeted therapy against loose\n\nmonetary policy.",
        "Another board director noted that the effectiveness of the selective credit\n\ncontrols was hampered by the liquidity flush in the domestic market.",
        "However, the Bank should\n\nnot be discouraged by the limited results but rather carried on with what should be done.",
        "Deliberations on the effectiveness of the implemented selective credit control measures\n\nOne board director noted that the Bank had made three rounds of adjustments (four, if\n\nincluding this round) to its selective credit control measures, which seemed to make such moves\n\nmore predictable, if not formulaic; it is thus important to monitor if the expected effectiveness\n\nis attained.",
        "Another board director noted that despite a series of selective credit controls being\n\nrolled out, they had not shown concrete results; it is thus important to find out if public\n\nconfidence in the Bank is impaired consequently.",
        "One board director pointed out that given a 62% share of land loans in construction loans,\n\noverall, construction lending had seen a decline in annual growth since January 2021 and the\n\nannual growth rate of housing loans had also trended down since June 2021.",
        "Meanwhile, real\n\nestate lending as a percentage of total bank lending had remained stable.",
        "These readings all\n\nattested to the effectiveness of the three rounds of selective credit controls.",
        "Deliberations on the content of the selective credit control measures\n\nOne board director stated that in an market economy, property investment should be done\n\nwith own funds instead of tapping bank loans; in that sense, the LTV cap on new housing loans\n\nfor borrowers with at least two outstanding loans should be even lower than proposed.",
        "Another\n\nboard director contended that the current housing market conditions were different from the\n\ndays back in 2010; the situation today was more complicated and challenging, as the recent\n\nhousing boom was not merely fueled by speculation but also buttressed by solid real demand.",
        "Furthermore, the Bank had previously introduced the control measure of allowing no grace\n\nperiods for a second housing loan in eight “specific areas.” Should the real estate market remain\n\nheated, more targeted prudential measures could be deployed to rein it in.",
        "Several board directors gave their views about the requirement that land loan borrowers\n\nshould commit to begin construction work within a specific time frame.",
        "One of these board\n\ndirectors stated that the rules need to be clearer and more specific.",
        "Another board director\n\npointed out that, to commence construction, builders must apply for building permits first and\n\nthis process is often subject to less predictable variables (e.g., from the local governments or\n\nthe community); therefore, some flexibility in the follow-up is still needed to allow for\n\nunforeseen situations.",
        "One board director stated that, after the adjustments are approved, the Bank will meet with\n\nbanks with the aim of further improving the relevant rules.",
        "Considering that land loan cases\n\ncould be complicated, the Bank’s measures retain some flexibility for banks to determine the\n\n“specific time frame” at their own discretion.",
        "In the future, the Bank will further clarify the\n\nrelevant rules via official circulars to facilitate bank compliance by providing them with\n\nuniform standards.",
        "Moreover, the Bank would also supplement the effort by conducting target\n\nexaminations to see if banks hike the interest rates or revoke the loans when borrowers fail to\n\nbegin construction within the promised time frame.",
        "Monetary Policy Decision: The board directors reached a unanimous vote to keep the**\n\ndiscount rate, the rate on refinancing of secured loans, and the rate on temporary\n\naccommodations unchanged at 1.125%, 1.5%, and 3.375%, respectively, and to adjust the\n\nBank’s selective credit control measures.",
        "Since the Board met in September this year, global economic and trade activity has\n\ncontinued to recover, underpinned by the easing of COVID-19 pandemic situations and\n\nmonetary and fiscal stimulus measures adopted by major economies.",
        "However, lingering\n\nsupply chain bottlenecks and elevated price levels of crude oil and other international\n\ncommodities have prompted inflation rates in the US and the euro area to rise further.",
        "Meanwhile, rising pandemic uncertainties stoked by the recent spread of new virus variants,\n\nwhich induced market concerns over economic prospects, and the US Fed's faster tapering\n\nof asset purchases have combined to spark greater volatility in global financial markets.",
        "International institutions forecast the global economic recovery to remain on track, though\n\nwith softer growth momentum.",
        "As supply and demand imbalances diminish, global\n\ninflation is likely to gradually return to normal.",
        "Nevertheless, the global economy still\n\nfaces multiple uncertainties, such as the evolution of the pandemic, the monetary policy\n\nstance of major central banks, developments of the US-China competition, and possible\n\ndamages that climate change may cause, which could present more downside risks to the\n\nglobal economic outlook.",
        "In recent months, exports registered robust and steady growth and private investment\n\nsustained solid momentum.",
        "Moreover, with the domestic pandemic situation under control,\n\nthe government rolled out consumption stimulus measures, leading to an upturn in private\n\nconsumption.",
        "The Bank projects Taiwan's economy to post solid expansion in the fourth\n\nquarter of 2021 and revises up the GDP growth forecast to 6.03% for the entire year.",
        "In\n\nterms of labor market conditions, the unemployment rate continued its downtrend and the\n\nnumber of employed persons increased further, but have not yet returned to their pre\npandemic levels.",
        "From the beginning of the year, the average nominal total earnings of\n\npayroll employees of the industrial and services sectors recorded modest growth.",
        "However,\n\nas some occupations of the services sector were hit harder by the pandemic, the nominal\n\ntotal earnings of their payroll employees decreased, indicating uneven recovery momentum\n\nacross sectors.",
        "Looking ahead to next year, a continued global economic recovery will help sustain growth\n\nmomentum for Taiwan's exports and private investment, albeit with the growth rates moderating because of a higher base effect.",
        "With the domestically-oriented services sector\n\ngradually picking up, employment will witness a larger increase.",
        "In addition, the hikes in\n\nminimum wage and public sector employee pay may spur wage increases for workers in the\n\nprivate sector.",
        "Therefore, private consumption growth is expected to rebound.",
        "Overall, the\n\nBank forecasts that Taiwan's economic growth would advance at a pace of 4.03% in 2022\n\nAs international oil price uptrends since the start of the year have prodded up domestic fuel\n\nand lubricant prices, and a lingering effect from the disruptions of typhoon and torrential\n\nrain in August has led to a spike in fruit and vegetables prices, together with a more recent\n\nprice hike by some food and beverage service providers, the annual growth rate of the\n\nconsumer price index (CPI) has registered above 2% for several months in a row and stood\n\nat 2.84% in November.",
        "Excluding fruit, vegetables, and energy items, the core CPI\n\nincreased at a milder pace than the CPI, posting an annual growth rate of 1.49% in\n\nNovember.",
        "For the first eleven months of the year, the average annual growth rates of the\n\nCPI and the core CPI were 1.91% and 1.28%, respectively.",
        "For the year as a whole, the\n\nBank projects that the annual CPI growth rate would be 1.97% and that of the core CPI\n\nwould register 1.31% (Appendix Table 2).",
        "Domestic inflation pressures have built up further since the middle of the year.",
        "However,\n\nprice increases in Taiwan have not been as significant as those in European economies or\n\nthe US.",
        "This was mainly because Taiwan has broadly kept the pandemic situation under\n\ncontrol and has experienced little supply chain bottlenecks such as logistics problems, and\n\nthe domestic labor market did not face capacity constraints and recorded mild growth in\n\naverage non-farm employee earnings.",
        "Looking at next year, the base wage increase, the public sector pay raise, and potential price\n\nhikes in some sectors to reflect higher personnel and raw material costs could push prices\n\nupwards.",
        "Nonetheless, with major institutions projecting a slower ascent for international\n\noil prices in 2022, the Bank expects the domestic CPI annual growth rate to drop to 1.59%\n\nand the core CPI to maintain mild growth at a pace of 1.45%.",
        "Similarly, most of the selected\n\ninternational and domestic institutions forecast Taiwan's 2022 annual CPI growth rate to\n\nrun lower than this year.",
        "In recent months, banks' excess reserves stayed somewhat above NT$60 billion.",
        "The\n\nmonetary aggregate M2, which increased by 8.61% year on year during the third quarter,\n\ngrew at a slower pace at 8.45% in October.",
        "Loans and investments by the banking sector\n\ncontinued expanding, posting an annual growth rate of 8.17% in October.",
        "Meanwhile, short and long-term market interest rates fluctuated within a tight range.",
        "Overall, financial\n\nconditions were accommodative.",
        "Adjustments to the expiry dates of the Bank's Special Accommodation Facility\n\nBack in April 2020, the Bank launched the Special Accommodation Facility to Support Bank\n\nCredit to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs).",
        "Under the Facility, financial\n\ninstitutions have so far approved more than 290 thousand applications with the total\n\ndisbursement exceeding NT$460 billion, providing the pandemic-hit SMEs with the funds\n\nneeded to stay afloat.",
        "As the pandemic situation was broadly stable at home, enterprises\n\ngradually resumed normal operation and the need for such funding assistance also waned.",
        "Therefore, the deadline for banks to accept new SME loan applications under the Facility\n\nwill remain December 31, 2021, as previously announced.",
        "For the Facility's accommodations to banks, effective December 16, 2021, those due for\n\nrepayment by December 31, 2021 (i.e., those approved between April 1, 2020 and July 4,\n\n2021) will be rolled over to June 30, 2022, so as to continue offering assistance by easing\n\ncorporate funding burdens and to help the affected enterprises recover.",
        "Meanwhile, SME\n\nloans granted by banks under the Facility during the aforementioned period (2020/04/01 –\n\n2021/07/04) will remain eligible for the Facility's preferential interest rates until June 30,\n\n2022.",
        "Beyond June 30, 2022, when the Facility ceases to apply, banks' loans to SMEs will come\n\nfrom their own funds instead of the Bank's special accommodations and the interest rates will\n\nbe set according to each bank's pricing strategies.",
        "To avoid possible disruptions to corporate\n\nfunding, the Bank urges SMEs to prepare in advance with proper financial planning.",
        "The Board considered the economic and financial conditions at home and abroad in today's\n\nmeeting: The current domestic inflation situation is viewed as manageable and the inflation\n\nrate is expected to return to a slower pace next year.",
        "Taiwan's economy is projected to\n\nexhibit strong growth this year, albeit with divergence among different sectors, and is also\n\nexpected to post solid growth next year as the global economic recovery continues onwards\n\namid potential downside risks.",
        "Against this background, the Board judged that maintaining\n\nthe current policy rate levels and monetary easing would help foster sound financial\n\ndevelopment and economic growth.",
        "The Board decided unanimously to keep the discount rate, the rate on refinancing of secured\n\nloans, and the rate on temporary accommodations unchanged at 1.125%, 1.5%, and 3.375%,\n\nrespectively.",
        "Looking ahead, given the uncertainty over global inflation, if domestic prices are\n\npersistently higher, or pandemic-hit sectors regain solid footing, or major economies begin\n\nto raise policy rates, the Bank may, as necessary, adjust its monetary policy timely and\n\nappropriately to fulfill its statutory duties.",
        "Since December 2020, the Bank has made three amendments to the selective credit control\n\nmeasures, which have helped banks reduce credit risk.",
        "Nevertheless, recent data showed\n\nthat real estate lending still made up a dominant share in total bank lending.",
        "Lowering the LTV ratio caps on a high-value housing loan and on a third (or more)\n\nhousing loan to 40%.",
        "Lowering the LTV ratio cap on land loans to 50%, including 10% thereof to be\n\nwithheld for disbursement until construction commences within the promised time\n\nframe as formally undertaken by the loans' borrowers.",
        "Lowering the LTV ratio cap on loans for unsold new housing units to 40%.",
        "Lowering the LTV ratio cap on mortgage loans for idle land in industrial districts to\n\n40%.",
        "The Board judged that the measures adopted by the Bank to help rein in credit risk\n\nassociated with real estate lending have represented active efforts in achieving effective\n\nallocation and proper use of credit resources, which are part of the government's Healthy\n\nReal Estate Market Plan.",
        "However, it still requires concerted actions under the Plan's\n\nvarious policy aspects in order to promote sound development of the real estate market.",
        "Considering that the average mortgage burden ratio (monthly housing loan repayment as a\n\npercentage of monthly disposable income) of Taiwanese households exceeds 30%, the\n\nBank urges mortgage borrowers to caution an immediate increase in repayment after the\n\ngrace period and a risk of possible interest rate changes.",
        "The NT dollar exchange rate is in principle determined by market forces.",
        "Nonetheless,\n\nwhen seasonal or irregular factors (such as massive inflows or outflows of short-term\n\ncapital) lead to excess volatility and disorderly movements in the NT dollar exchange rate\n\nwith adverse implications for economic and financial stability, the Bank, in line with its\n\nstatutory mandates, will step in to maintain an orderly market.",
        "Major  economies  had  begun  reopening  from  the  coronavirus  (COVID-19)  lockdown  and \ncontinued  with  macro  support  policies,  boosting  consumption  and  investment  demand.",

        "World trade volumes, \nhaving returned to pre-pandemic levels, were also forecasted to expand significantly from a low \ncomparison base last year.",
        "Reduced crude inventory and buoyant economic activity in the US and Europe helped push \noil prices upwards from April on.",

        "The uptrend in grain prices since early April on account \nof bad weather conditions in the US and Brazil weakened afterwards as supply was estimated to \nbe sufficient and weather conditions in crop areas improved.",
        "Given  the  uptrend  in  international  raw  material  prices,  surging  transport  costs,  and  rising \nglobal demand, along with some supply chain bottlenecks lingering for at least a short while, as \nwell as a lower base effect, global inflation was projected by international institutions to accelerate \nthis year.",
        "Since  after  the  last  Board  Meeting  in  March,  major  economies  kept  expansionary  fiscal \npolicy in place, and their central banks maintained an accommodative stance while reiterating that \na tightening would be premature.",
        "In terms of global financial market developments since April, market liquidity stayed ample, \nthe  Fed  judged  that  rising  inflation  was  transitory,  and  US  non-farm  payroll  employment  was \nlower than expected.",
        "As a result, the 10-year US Treasury  yields trended down, as did German \nand Japanese government bond yields.",
        "Meanwhile, the Fed’s message that helped dismiss market \nexpectations of a premature policy tightening led major stock markets to broadly rally and the US \ndollar index to slide.",
        "Looking  ahead,  the  global  economic  outlook  still  faces  uncertainties,  mainly  from  (1) \nrepeated COVID-19 outbreaks, new virus variants, and uneven vaccination progress, leading to a \nlonger  wait  before  the  pandemic  can  be  well  contained;  (2)  a  continued  buildup  of  financial \nfragilities, including elevated asset prices around the world and an outsize global debt overhang; \n(3) changes in monetary policy of major central banks, which could trigger global financial market \nturbulence; (4) lingering global economic and trade uncertainties such as US-China relations, as \nwell  as  risks  associated  with  climate  change.",
        "Should  these  uncertainties  and  risks  materialize \nand/or intensify, they could weigh down the global economic recovery.",
        "The domestic COVID-19 case spike in mid-May dimmed business sentiment about economic \nprospects, reflected particularly  in the precipitous fall in the six-month outlook subindex under \nTaiwan’s Non-Manufacturing Index (NMI).",
        "In terms of external demand, most of Taiwan’s major export products recorded marked \nexpansion  thanks  to  advancement  in  emerging  technology  applications,  growing  business  for \ncontactless activity, and rising demand for traditional manufacturing goods.",
        "Exports to Taiwan’s \nmajor trading partners also registered a broad uptrend.",
        "Considering an expected demand boom for \ntech  products  and  traditional  manufacturing  goods  as  the  world  economy  and  trade  revive,  the \nBank projected Taiwan’s exports/imports to grow substantially in real terms this year.",
        "Regarding domestic demand, Taiwanese tech firms increased capital outlay, multinationals \nincreased  their  footprint  on  this  island,  while  the  government  continued  with  infrastructure \nbuilding for green energy and 5G network development and projects to facilitate urban renewal \nand construction of social housing.",
        "Therefore, the Bank expected to see private investment register \nsolid  real  growth  this  year.",
        "As  to  private  consumption,  tightened  containment  measures  in \nresponse  to  the  domestic  COVID-19  flareup  restrained  consumer  spending  from  mid-May \nonwards.",
        "For  the  year  as  a  whole,  however,  the  Bank  projected  mild  real  growth  in  private \nconsumption, to be supported by buoyant business to meet demand for remote work/learning and \nstay-at-home economy and by pent-up demand unleashed in the fourth quarter after the domestic \noutbreak eases.",
        "In the first four months of the year, labor market conditions were stable, and the \nunemployment rate dropped.",

        "Overall,  private  consumption  came  under  strains  owing  to  the  virus  spike  in  mid-May, \nwhereas exports and private investment both expanded and the government increased spending to \ncushion the pandemic’s economic impact with enhanced relief and support measures.",

        "These \nincluded a surge in coronavirus infections and the enactment of the amendments to the so-called\n“integrated house and land sales tax” and the property transaction price declaration mechanism in \nJuly.",
        "Banks were still upbeat about the outlook for the residential housing market in major cities, \nalbeit with less optimism.",
        "In the  year so far, international commodity markets saw price rises for crude oil and other \nraw materials, pushing up domestic fuel and lubricant prices.",
        "Combined with a lower base effect, \nthe annual growth rate of the consumer price index (CPI) trended up and reached 2.48% in May \nand that of the core CPI increased mildly at a pace of 1.58%.",
        "The average CPI annual growth rate \nfor  the  17  staple  goods  items  dropped  for  the  fourth  consecutive  month  and  reached  1.33%  in \nMay, the second month it went lower than the headline CPI annual growth rate.",
        "For  the  first  five  months  of  the  year,  the  CPI  annual  growth  rate  averaged  1.39%,  a  mild \nincrease mainly because of a more pronounced surge in fuel and lubricant prices compared to the \nlower base a year ago (affected by the international oil price slump) and more expensive airline \nfares pushed up by limited supply.",
        "The marked rebound in international raw material prices this year drove up prices of imports \nand goods for domestic sales, stepping up pressures of imported inflation.",
        "The Bank’s survey on \ninvestment trust companies revealed a significant increase in the number of respondents expecting \nthe  CPI  inflation  rate  to  exceed  1%  in  the  following  12  months,  indicating  higher  inflation \nexpectations.",
        "Meanwhile,  the  survey  on  firms  showed  that  most  respondents  expected  the  CPI \ninflation rate to stay below 2% in the same period, indicating still mild inflation expectations.",
        "In \naddition, the mean inflation projections by forecasting institutions have went up month by month \nsince March; the mean value was 1.5% in May, pointing to a still mild inflation outlook.",
        "According to the Bank’s estimation, the inflation  rate  this  year  would  peak  in  the  second \nquarter owing to a one-off spike from the lower base a year ago.",
        "The Bank forecasted Taiwan’s \nCPI and core CPI annual growth rates to reach 1.60% and 1.11% for this year as a whole, while \nCPI inflation projections of major institutions ranged between 1.20% and 1.73%.",
        "Future upside pressures on domestic prices include (1) an expected price rise for crude oil \nand other raw materials and a surge in international freight charges, buoying up import prices; (2) \ndomestic food prices facing upward pressures, as international food commodity prices trend up and  domestic  farm  produce  is  affected  by  drastic  weather  conditions  (i.e.,  an  extended  drought \nfollowed  by  torrential  rains);  (3)  flight  ticket  fares  soaring  on  greater  demand  from  people \nconcerned  about  the  domestic  coronavirus  flareup.",
        "On  the  other  hand,  downside  pressures  are \nexpected to result from persistently low communication fees and possible price cuts by food and \nbeverage service providers and the hospitality sector to appeal to consumers following the recent \nepidemic flareup.",
        "(1) Global economic growth gathers pace but still needs to confront a horde of risks; major \neconomies continue with monetary easing and large fiscal stimulus packages.",
        "(2) The present uptick in inflation is judged to be transitory and inflation is expected to be mild this \nyear.",

        "The CPI and core CPI annual growth rates are projected to \nbe 1.60% and 1.11% this year.",
        "(3) Despite epidemic-related constraints on consumption growth, exports and private investment are \nexpected to support the domestic economy towards steady growth this year.",

        "Policy Proposition: To keep the discount rate, the rate on refinancing of secured loans, \nand the rate on temporary accommodations unchanged at 1.125%, 1.5%, and 3.375%, \nrespectively.",
        "Board  members  reached  a  unanimous  vote  to  keep  the  policy  rates  unchanged.",
        "Related \ndiscussions are summarized as follows.",
        "(1) Discussion on domestic and international economic and financial conditions \nSeveral board directors expressed views on inflation at home and abroad.",
        "One director cited \nthe forecasts of the US headline and core price indices for personal consumption expenditures \n(PCE), released after the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) June Meeting, and pointed \nout that US inflation could climb higher this year before declining next year.",
        "Meanwhile, imported \ninflation  resulting from  international crude oil price upswings tend to significantly  affect the domestic prices given that Taiwan is a small open economy.",
        "For example, half of the 2.48% rise in \ninflation in May was attributable to increases in fuel and lubricant prices and airplane fares.",
        "It \nwarrants further monitoring to see whether the upturn in domestic inflation is extended.",
        "One board director pointed out that the indices of import prices and prices of goods for \ndomestic sales both exhibited rapidly year-on-year uptrends in recent months.",
        "Aside from a lower \nbase effect, another crucial factor behind the rises would be soaring prices of raw material imports.",
        "Since some domestic inflation forecast studies have found that the import price index and the \nwholesale price index could be useful guides in forecasting future inflation trends, the upside risk \nto inflation from the aforementioned rises of these indices would need close monitoring.",
        "One board director noted that the Fed deemed the recent inflation uptick to be transient and \nirrelevant to long-term trends.",
        "For Taiwan, the DGBAS and the Bank upgraded this year’s inflation \nforecasts to 1.8% and 1.6%, respectively.",
        "Although the CPI annual growth rate witnessed drastic \nrises in recent months, it was partially due to a lower base effect.",
        "The director noted that the Bank’s \nrevised forecast of 1.6% represented an increase of about 1.8 percentage points from the previous \nyear’s inflation of -0.23%, and suggested the Bank look at annual data series to determine if inflation \nremains mild.",
        "The director also raised a question about the extent to which the inflation rate rises \nthat would lead the Bank to consider as overheating.",
        "Another board director pointed out that the latest inflation target (using core CPI annual growth \nrate) set out in the National Development Council’s “National Development Plan (2021-2024)” was \nwithin a range of 1.0%-1.5%, while previous targets (using CPI annual growth rate) were set at \nbelow 2%.",
        "For small open economies like Taiwan, it has always been a difficult task to manage \ninflation, as demonstrated by the effects of international crude oil price fluctuations on domestic \nprices.",
        "Switzerland, also a small open economy, has an inflation target below 2% but above 0%, \nbasically the same as the Bank’s acceptable inflation range of 0%-2%.",
        "At this juncture, it would be \nokay for domestic inflation to run slightly higher in the interim when domestic demand is bolstered \nby rising investment.",
        "Currently, Taiwan’s inflation is not much a cause for concern.",
        "One board director noted that the government has been actively monitoring the price trends of \ndomestic staple goods and services, including oil, water, and transportation (such as the High Speed \nRail).",
        "From the practical point of view, there were few reasons to worry about Taiwan’s inflation, \nbut continued study and exploration would still worth the effort.",
        "Another board director stated that the Fed’s internal views about future inflation were not \nuniform, and the press and academia had also vigorously debated on this issue.",
        "By contrast, serious \ndebates and rigorous research on inflation are somewhat insufficient in Taiwan.",
        "Do the same factors \nthat have held inflation steady or down in the past three decades remain in sight?",
        "The director \npointed out that the dynamics between some of these factors and inflation trends have changed.",
        "It \nis therefore worth studying whether there might be a tipping point that triggers inflation.",
        "One other board director shared the opinion that US inflation had been broadly steady thanks \nmainly to the globalization process that provided the country with goods at the lowest costs, hence \nthe low imported inflation reflected in low CPI and PCE annual growth rates.",
        "However, it remains \nuncertain if a tipping point would be upcoming to set off inflation.",
        "Meanwhile, given the US-China \ntrade conflict, some supply chains could shift out of China, driving production costs upwards.",
        "Transportation costs could also rise further as the pandemic led to container shipping shortage and \ndelays.",
        "While globalization, and it effects on US inflation, might not be reversible, a changed \nenvironment could still bring about changes to inflation trends.",
        "Regarding financial conditions, one board director stated that domestic financial conditions \nwere  stable,  whereas  the  global  economic  outlook  remained  shrouded  in  many  uncertainties \nincluding mounting financial fragilities and turmoil in major financial markets.",
        "The domestic \nCOVID-19 flareup from mid-May certainly dealt a blow to the economy.",
        "In the financial industry \nsector, the upgraded epidemic alert and the ensuing restrictions already hit banks in several business \nareas such as lending, fees and proceeds, and wealth management.",
        "This could lead to deterioration \nin asset quality.",
        "Although it is believed that Taiwan’s financial industry would strive to do their part \nand stay accountable even as these uncertainties strike, it is important to keep a close watch on how \nthe COVID-19 outbreaks affect the overall financial conditions and the financial market and to take \nnecessary action.",
        "All board directors favored the decision to keep the policy interest rates unchanged, based \nmainly on the uncertainty surrounding economic growth amid the recent domestic virus flareup.",
        "One board director agreed with the rate hold decision and gave three reasons: (1) the impact from \nthe recent outbreak flareup could slow down Taiwan’s economic growth for the latter three quarters \nof this year; (2) the recent inflation uptick was deemed transitory and the inflation outlook was mild according to the Bank’s survey on firms of which only 25% expected the CPI inflation to exceed \n2% in the following 12 months; (3) market liquidity was judged to be quite ample.",
        "In all, these \nfactors would mean there is little room for a rate hike.",
        "A relatively strong NT dollar recently would \nalso justify the decision not to raise the rates.",
        "In terms of a rate cut, given the historically low levels \nof the policy rates at present, the room and the effect of a reduction would be very limited.",
        "Another board director showed support for the rate hold decision and gave the opinion that \nalthough domestic epidemic-related uncertainty remained high, exports – the driving force of \nTaiwan’s economic activity – posted solid growth.",
        "Nevertheless, it is important to closely monitor \ndomestic COVID-19 developments in the coming month or two.",
        "If the epidemic continues to be \nworrying and could further hamper economic activity, the Bank may consider to expand its special \naccommodation facility to help banks support small and medium-sized enterprises.",
        "One board director noted that this was not the time to hike the policy rates given the uncertainty \nfrom the domestic coronavirus developments and an escalation of the outbreak compared to that \nwhen  the  Board  last  convened.",
        "Meanwhile,  a  historically  low  rate  level,  upside  inflationary \npressures from rising raw material prices and transportation costs, and ample market liquidity all \nmade a rate cut an ill-timed adjustment.",
        "Moreover, the FOMC maintained the fed funds rates but \nraised the interest on excess reserves (IOER) rate by five basis points, which was technically a rate \nhike, and it seemed that for the Bank to cut the rates now would be a monetary policy stance veering \nin the opposite direction of the Fed’s.",
        "On balance, this director viewed that a rate hold would be the \nappropriate decision.",
        "Two board directors gave their support for the rate decision, citing a global economic rebound, \nthe gradual US and European economic recovery, and the recent infection case spike’s impact on \nthe domestic economy.",
        "Another board director pointed out that most major economies have kept \ntheir policy rates unchanged since April this year in order to buttress the economic recovery.",
        "Furthermore, a rate hold would be consistent with the public’s and the market’s expectation for the \nBank’s monetary policy path.",
        "The director therefore supported the proposed decision to not adjust \nthe policy rates.",
        "Several board directors discussed the Bank’s selective credit control measures.",
        "One board \ndirector noted that, against a backdrop of two rounds of selective credit controls, the upcoming \nimplementation of property sales income tax amendments and housing price registration revisions, and the domestic virus flareup, the housing market already cooled down in June and there was no \npressing  need  for  the  Bank  to  introduce  more  regulations.",
        "The  banking  sector  also  clearly \nunderstood and actively followed the government’s housing market policy, adopting relevant self-\ndiscipline and control measures.",
        "For the time being, it seemed the Bank did not need to take the \nselective credit control measures even further.",
        "Another board director pointed to the lingering uncertainty about the COVID-19 pandemic and \nthe fact that the recent two rounds of selective credit controls were working well, and suggested to \nnot adjust such measures at the current juncture.",
        "Several other board directors also noted that it \nwould be appropriate to consider any adjustment to these controls after more is known about the \ndevelopments  of  the  pandemic  and  the  effects  of  the  property  sales-related  tax  and  system \namendments, effective in July, on the housing market.",
        "Monetary Policy Decision: The board directors reached a unanimous vote to keep the discount \nrate,  the  rate  on  refinancing  of  secured  loans,  and  the  rate  on  temporary  accommodations \nunchanged at 1.125%, 1.5%, and 3.375%, respectively.",
        "The  board  directors  and  supervisors  approved  unanimously  to  issue  the  following  press \nrelease in the post-meeting press conference, together with the Supplementary Materials for the \nPost-Monetary Policy Meeting Press Conference prepared by the Bank.",
        "Since the Board last met in March, economies where the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak \ncame under control such as the US and Europe have gradually relaxed pandemic restrictions \nwhile keeping monetary  and fiscal policy support in place, helping to sustain the upturn in \nglobal economic and trade activity and bolster the prices of crude oil and other commodities.",
        "Citing  a  marked  firming  in  global  demand  and  a  lower  base  effect  from  the  previous  year, \ninternational  forecasting  institutions  expect to  see  the  world  economy  rebound  sharply  and \ninflation pick up faster this year.",
        "Meanwhile, recent concerns about the future courses of US \ninflation and the Fed’s monetary policy have rattled international financial markets.",
        "The global economic outlook remains clouded by pandemic uncertainties, including recurring \nvirus  outbreaks,  discovery  of  new  virus  variants,  and  uneven  vaccination  progress  across \nregions.",
        "In addition, global financial fragilities from elevated asset prices and debt levels, the \ndirection of monetary policy of major central banks, US-China relations, and climate change-\nrelated risks could also affect global economic and financial prospects.",
        "Domestic economic and financial conditions \nIn  respect  of  domestic  economic  conditions  in  the  first  quarter  of  2021,  exports  and \nmanufacturing production were substantially boosted by robust demand for tech and \ntraditional  sector  products  owing  to  a  global  economic  recovery.",
        "With  private  investment \nexpanding and private consumption reviving, domestic economic growth accelerated.",
        "Labor \nmarket  conditions  were  stable  and  the  unemployment  rate  dropped.",
        "As  from  mid-May, \nhowever,  a  surge  in  coronavirus  caseloads  led  to  tighter  restrictions  that  battered  the \ndomestically-oriented services sector and put more people on furlough, significantly \ndampening  private  consumption.",
        "By  contrast,  exports  strengthened  steadily  and  private \ninvestment  proceeded  apace.",
        "Taken  together,  economic  growth  is  thus  expected  to  slow \nslightly in the second quarter.",
        "Looking at the latter half of 2021, the economy is likely to gain momentum from exports and \nprivate  investment  growth  well-underpinned  by  a  continued  global  economic  recovery, \nincreased  government  spending  on  pandemic  relief  efforts,  and  the  prospect  of  private \nconsumption  stabilizing  once  the  domestic  outbreak  is  contained.",
        "In  this  view,  the  Bank anticipates  a  slower  growth  pace  in  the  second  half  of  2021  compared  to  the  first  half  and \nforecasts Taiwan's economy to grow by 5.08% for the year as a whole (Appendix Table 1).",
        "As  domestic  fuel  and  lubricant  prices  surged  on  the  back  of  international  crude  oil  price \nupswings from the beginning of the year, coupled with a lower base effect, the annual growth \nrate of the consumer price index (CPI) climbed and reached 2.48% in May while that of the \ncore  CPI  (excluding  fruit,  vegetables,  and  energy  items)  stood  at  1.58%.",
        "For  the  first  five \nmonths of the year, the average annual growth rates of the CPI and the core CPI were 1.39% \nand  1.13%,  respectively,  representing  mild  price  uptrends  for  both.",
        "Domestic  inflation  is \nestimated  to  peak  in  the  second  quarter  –  a  transitory  uptick  owing  to  a  lower  base  effect, \nbefore  moderating  gradually  in  the  second  half  of  the  year.",
        "For  2021  as  a  whole,  the  Bank \nprojects  the  CPI  and  core  CPI  annual  growth  rates  to  be  1.60%  and  1.11%,  respectively \n(Appendix Table 2).",

        "Meanwhile, short- and long-\nterm market interest rates fluctuated slightly.",
        "Overall, financial conditions were \naccommodative.",
        "Under the Bank's the Special Accommodation Facility to Support Bank Credit to SMEs (''the \nFacility'')  launched  in  April  2020,  financial  institutions  have  so  far  received  approximately \n223 thousand applications with the amount totaling NT$326.2 billion.",
        "As of the end of April \n2021,  the  annual  growth  rate  of  SME  loans  extended  by  banks  registered  13.46%  and  the \nannual growth rate of overall bank lending was 7.32%.",
        "To enhance SME funding support following the  COVID-19 flare-up in mid-May, the Bank \nraised the total amount of the Facility from NT$300 billion to NT$400 billion, extended the \ndeadline  for  SME  applications  to  Dec.  31,  2021,  stretched  the  applicable  duration  of \npreferential  interest  rates  on  newly-approved  cases  through  to  June  30,  2022,  and  allowed \nincreased  borrowing  within  the  specified  maximum.",
        "Effective  from  June  4,  2021,  this \nexpanded policy effort is envisaged to continue to help SMEs bridge across this challenging \nperiod of economic disruption.",
        "Abroad,  the  global  economic  pickup  could  still  be  mired  by  a  multitude  of  risks,  and  major \neconomies  have  maintained  monetary  easing  and  large  fiscal  stimuluses.",
        "At  home,  domestic \ninflation is expected to be mild this year after the transient spike wanes, and exports and private \ninvestment  would  buttress  solid  economic  growth  for  the  year  as  a  whole  despite  recent \npandemic-induced  strains  on  consumption.",
        "Taking  this  assessment  into  account,  the  Board \njudged that maintaining the current policy rate levels and monetary easing would help sustain \nprice and financial stability and foster economic growth.",

        "Public  demand  for  currency  increased  in  February,  the  month  the  Lunar  New  Year \nholidays  fell  in,  followed  by  a  flow  of  currency  back  into  the  banking  system  afterwards.",
        "In \naddition, market liquidity conditions were accommodative and short-term interest rates \nfluctuated  within  a  very  small  range.",
        "The  annual  growth  rate  of  the  monetary  aggregate  M2 \ntrended up recently, mainly reflecting a continued increase in bank loans and investments and \na net capital inflow.",
        "In the housing market, prices of new housing projects and existing homes continued rising \nin the first three quarters of 2020 against a background of repatriation of offshore funds, more \nurban  renewals,  and  ample  market  liquidity.",
        "In  the  fourth  quarter,  prices  of  new  housing \nprojects  inched  down,  dampened  partly  by the Bank’s selective  credit  control  adjustments \n(effective December 8, 2020).",
        "Entering the year 2021, building ownership transfers in the six \nSpecial Municipalities increased by 18.0% year on year during the Jan.-Feb. period.",
        "Meanwhile, a more distinct feature of hoarding and rapid turnover of multiple properties \nwas found among corporate entities.",
        "According to data from the Ministry of the Interior as of \nthe end of 2020, among corporate entity homeowners, those owning four or more homes made \nup  a  share  of  11.69%  and  accounted  for  73.55%  of  the  homes  owned  by  corporate  entities.",
        "Furthermore, in the fourth quarter of 2020, more than half – at 54.51% – of non-real estate and non-construction  related  corporations  sold  houses  within  one  year  of  purchase.",
        "Meanwhile, \nhigh-value  housing  transactions  had  been  heating  up,  partly  reflecting  demand  from  the \nreturning Taiwanese businessmen in the past year.",
        "In the four quarter of 2020, the number and \namount of high-value housing increased by 17.57% and 23.92% year on year, respectively.",
        "Mortgage credit continued to grow.",
        "As of the end of January 2021, the outstanding balance \nof  housing  loans  expanded  by  9.2%  year  on  year,  while  that  of  construction  loans  grew  by \n18.7% with land loans increasing the most at a pace of 28.5%.",
        "Meanwhile, the concentration \nratio of real estate lending rose further to 36.53%.",
        "On the other hand, the loan-to-value (LTV) ratios dropped slightly in January 2021, in line \nwith  the  effect  from  the  selective  credit  controls  tightened  by  the  Bank  last  December.",
        "The \nratios  of  non-performing  housing  loans  extended  by  domestic  banks  remained  low,  showing \ngood credit quality management.",
        "Looking at the number of housing loans to natural persons, those taking out four or more \nhousing loans (per borrower) registered a higher annual growth rate; though the pace already \nslowed from 4.0% of the third quarter of 2020 to 2.2% of the fourth quarter, both readings were \nfaster than the increases of those borrowing three or less housing loans.",
        "Meanwhile, the number \nand  amount  of  high-value  housing  loans  disbursed  posted  annual  growth  rates  of  18.1%  and \n20.8% in 2020.",
        "Furthermore, to encourage land owners to utilize idle land in industrial districts instead of \nleaving it unused after purchasing with bank loans, the Bank had, on multiple occasions, urged \nfinancial institutions to exercise caution when making loans collateralized by land classified for \nindustrial use and to formulate internal rules for self-discipline.",
        "In the year so far, the Bank already talked with many banks to find out about their status \nin  implementing  the  amended  selective  credit  controls.",
        "We  were  told  that  although  the \nprudential measures did help dampen speculative demand, housing prices were not expected to \ndecline soon given recent waves of capital repatriation and rising construction costs.",
        "The banks \nexpressed concern about property hoarding and house flipping by corporate entities, suggested \na  discriminative  bank  credit  policy  aiming  at  borrowers  with  multiple  outstanding  mortgage \nloans, and also said it would benefit banks if there could be a harmonized set of rules governing \nindustrial land loans so as to make compliance easier and prevent a mortgage price war.",
        "Meanwhile, homebuyer sentiment seemed to be dampened recently as the government’s \nhousing  market  policies  gradually  showed  results.",
        "In  terms  of  the  outlook  for  residential \nhousing market in major cities, banks showed slightly less optimism about some areas and were \ncontinuously upbeat about some other areas.",
        "(3) Price trends   \nFor the first two months of the year, the CPI annual growth rate averaged 0.59%, mainly \nbecause the upward pressures from increases in flight tickets and vegetable prices were partially \noffset by declines in prices of fruit and of fuel and lubricants.",
        "The average annual growth rate \nof core CPI saw a mild rise of 0.84% for the same period.",
        "Among the CPI basket of goods and services, the 17 staple goods deemed most often seen \non consumers’ shopping lists exhibited an average CPI annual growth rate of 1.95% during the \nJan.-Feb. period; this was higher than the headline CPI inflation rate but the rise was still mild.",
        "Meanwhile,  CPI  inflation  was  modest  across  various  consumption  frequencies  and  income \nlevels.",
        "With respect to inflation expectations, professional forecasters’ projections of Taiwan’s \nCPI  inflation  rate  had  stayed  around  1%  on  average  since  April  2020,  pointing  to  mild \nexpectations.",
        "A reference survey the Bank conducted on investment trust companies revealed \nan increased share of those respondents expecting domestic prices to slightly turn upwards, and \nthe expectation pointed to a mild inflation.",
        "For this year as a whole, in part because of rising import prices as the global impacts of \nCOVID-19 subside and international raw material prices rebound, along with a strengthening \nin  domestic  consumer  spending,  inflation  would  likely  climb  back  up,  albeit  with  a  mild \noutlook.",
        "Taiwan’s CPI and core CPI was forecasted to register annual growth rates of 1.07% \nand  0.77%,  this  year,  respectively,  according  to  the  Bank,  while  CPI  inflation  projections  of \nmajor forecasters ranged between 0.90% and 1.70%.",
        "Looking  at major  factors shaping future domestic price trends, upside pressures  include \nan  expected  rebound  in  prices  of  crude  oil  and  other  raw  materials  and  a  surge  in \ninternational freight charges could push import prices up; rises in food commodity prices \nabroad  and  a  protracted  drought  at  home  could  disrupt  crop  production,  potentially  driving \ndomestic food prices upwards; domestic consumer spending is expected to gather pace.",
        "On the other hand, persistently low communication fees could put downside pressures on domestic \nprices.",
        "The global economic outlook, though improving, remain shrouded in many uncertainties; \nmajor economies maintained an accommodative monetary policy stance and carried on \nwith expansionary fiscal policies.",
        "Given mild price trends and inflation outlook, the Bank forecasts the CPI and the core \nCPI annual growth rates to be 1.07% and 0.77% this year.",

        "The amended Regulations  Governing  the  Extension  of  Mortgage  Loans  by  Financial \nInstitutions (the Regulations) took effect on December 8, 2020, a policy move in line with \nthe aims of “efficient allocation and proper use of credit resources” in the government’s \n“Program to Foster a Sound Real Estate Market.” So far, the LTV ratios of the loans \ngoverned by the Regulations have dropped and the interest rates thereof have risen, but \nthere remains a substantial increase in banks’ real estate lending.",
        "To  preclude  a  disproportionate  surge  in  mortgage  credit,  and  to  reinforce  financial \ninstitutions’ management of credit risk associated with real estate lending, it would be \nappropriate to further enhance the Regulations in the following direction:   \nGiven that corporate entity home-buyers seem to be hoarding home properties and \nturning them over quickly, the LTV ratio cap on housing loans extended to corporate \nentities would be lowered.",
        "Considering that multiple mortgage loans taken out by natural persons could have \nadverse implications for banks’ management of credit risk associated with real estate \nlending,  the  LTV  ratio  cap  on  such  loans  would  be  adjusted,  with  different caps applicable depending on how many housing loans the borrower has taken out.",
        "In view of a price spillover of high-value housing to neighboring housing, and its volatile \nprice changes as well as the concomitant high credit risk, the LTV ratio cap would be \nlowered.",
        "With the aim of promoting land utilization in industrial districts, new restrictions on \nmortgage loans for idle land in such districts would be introduced as an official guideline \nfor banks.",
        "Policy Proposition: To keep the discount rate, the rate on refinancing of secured loans, \nand the rate on temporary accommodations unchanged at 1.125%, 1.5%, and 3.375%, \nrespectively; to adjust the Bank’s selective credit control measures.",
        "Board members reached a unanimous vote to keep the policy rates unchanged and to adjust \nthe Bank’s selective credit control measures.",
        "Related discussions are summarized as follows.",
        "All board directors expressed support for keeping the policy rates unchanged based on the \nassessment  of  lingering  uncertainties  over  the  domestic  economic  growth  amid  the  unabated \nglobal coronavirus pandemic.",
        "One board director noted there was no inflation risk at home and \nthe  pandemic  situation  still  represented  uncertainties  for  the  economic  outlook;  therefore,  it \nwould be appropriate to hold the policy rates steady.",
        "One  board  director  also  agreed  with  a  rate  hold,  noting  that  discussions  about  a  rate \nadjustment could at least wait until the government’s pandemic relief measures close on June \n30  this  year  and  would  depend  on  the  evolution  of  the  pandemic  or  developments  in  the \neconomic conditions.",
        "Another board director stated that a rate cut would have a limited effect \ngiven the circumstances, and the global economic recovery was still faced with high \nuncertainties;  the  economic  fundamentals,  pandemic-related  factors,  and  market  liquidity \nconditions would all justify a rate hold.",
        "Several board directors, all agreeing to maintain current rate levels, shared their views on \na recent inflation expectation uptick and the movements of the NT dollar exchange rate.",
        "One \nboard  director  pointed  out  that  there  would  be  little  space  for  rate  adjustments  given  that advanced economies broadly kept an accommodative monetary policy stance and that more US \nrelief measures were expected to be rolled out; nevertheless, market concerns surrounding US \ninflation could give rise to more uncertainties over the NT dollar, posing increasing challenges \nto the Bank’s exchange rate policy conduct; in this light, the Bank would also need to closely \nmonitor  how  the  exchange  rate  movements  would  affect  Taiwan’s  industries.",
        "Another  board \ndirector also noted the need to heed the risk from inflation expectations, and suggested the Bank \npay attention should renewed capital inflows for equity investment by foreign investors cause \nthe NT dollar to strengthen again.",
        "One  board  director  put  forward  a  proposition  that,  for  the  benefit  of  monetary  policy \nimplementation, the Bank may begin to conduct surveys on inflation expectations and consumer \nfinances at its earliest convenience.",
        "The main considerations included (1) price stability is one \nof the Bank’s objectives, and one of the key factors affecting  domestic  prices  is  consumer \nbehavior shaped in part by inflation expectations; (2) by surveying consumer finances, which \nwould  encompass  statistical  data  on  household  balance  sheet,  real  estate,  financial  assets, \nincome, borrowing, use of payment tools, saving and investment intensions, etc., the Bank may \nget a better understanding of Taiwan’s household financial conditions.",
        "The proposition gained \nsupport  from  several  board  directors;  one  of  them  stated  that  the  Bank  would  prioritize  an \ninflation expectation survey, whereas a consumer finance survey might be conducted through \nother government agencies or outsourced parties given its complicated process and relatively \ndifficult  implementation.",
        "One  supervisor  pointed  out  that  some  of  the  data  on  consumer \nfinances might not be available owing to trade secret protection.",
        "All  board  directors  were  in  favor  of  the  decision  to  adjust  the  selective  credit  control \nmeasures.",
        "One board director noted that, considering a growing risk of a housing price surge, a \nproperly-adopted set of selective credit controls would be needed to curb an inordinately high \nflow of credit resources into the real estate market.",
        "Another board director stated that the share \nof  real  estate  loans  extended  by  banks  continued  increasing  despite  the  targeted  prudential \nmeasures introduced in December, thus warranting the proposed adjustment.",
        "Several board directors shared their views on the  content of this adjustment.",
        "One board \ndirector remarked that housing loans extended to corporate entities should be subject to a lower \nLTV  cap;  regarding  high-value  housing,  in  addition  to  being  an  upward  factor  behind \nneighborhood housing price rises, natural-person owners – 80% of which own only one housing \nunit and a relatively modest share owning four or more units according to tax statistics – tend \nnot to buy a fourth or more high-value housing unit for own-occupancy purposes.",
        "Accordingly, \na lower LTV cap – similar to that on corporate borrowers’ mortgages – on the fourth or more \nhigh-value housing loans taken out by natural persons would help dent homebuying enthusiasm, \nalbeit with a potential impact on bank lending business.",
        "One board director also agreed there is a need for such restrictions on mortgage loans taken \nout by corporate entities and on those for high-value housing; moreover, given that corporate \nentities do not run on real estate transactions and that owning four (or more) high-value homes \nis out of the ordinary, lower LTV caps would be warranted.",
        "Another board director pointed out \nthat, to differentiate among varying levels of underlying risks of housing loans, there should be \na  lower  LTV  cap  on  a  fourth  (or  more)  mortgage  loan  taken  out  by  natural  persons  for \npurchasing  high-value  housing;  this  would  also  be  in  line  with  the  Principles  for  Sound \nResidential  Mortgage  Underwriting  Practices  issued  by  the  Financial  Stability  Board,  which \nrecommends more conservative underwriting criteria in view of higher underlying risks.",
        "One  board  director  noted  that,  given  the  housing  market  boom  at  present,  banks  could \nconsider  applying  lower  LTV  ratio  caps  to  certain  mortgage  types;  however,  for  those  firms \nlooking to build plants, their substantive investment plans should be financed under less strict \nunderwriting  standards.",
        "Therefore,  it  would  be  appropriate  to  set  forth  some  exceptions  or \nconditions regarding loans collateralized by idle land in industrial districts.",
        "Another board director suggested that the Bank use progressive adjustments to the LTV \nratio caps so that space is reserved for any future adjustment if warranted by the developments \nin the real estate market; meanwhile, tightening the caps excessively in one take would come \nas a drastic shock to the public.",
        "One supervisor also noted that an excessive, drastic reduction in the LTV cap could instead \nraise the risks to banks from outstanding mortgage loans as tighter caps could curtail housing \ndemand and causing price falls, thereby hurting the value of collaterals, particularly in the case \nof luxury homes.",
        "One board director pointed out that many buyers of high-value homes actually \nhave deep pockets and do not need to take out mortgages.",
        "Another board director stated that\nhousing loans granted with high LTV ratios are susceptible to a price trend reversal that could \ncause the amount of the loans to exceed the market value of their collaterals, creating credit risk \nto banks; likewise, risk therefrom would be smaller if the LTV ratios are lower.",
        "Several  board  directors  pointed  to  the  significance  of  real  estate  lending  to  financial \nstability  and  suggested  that  the  Bank  review  and  evaluate  the  results  of  the  selective  credit \ncontrols after some time into the implementation.",
        "Monetary  Policy  Decision:  The  board  directors  reached  a  unanimous  vote  to  keep  the \ndiscount rate, the rate on refinancing of secured loans, and the rate on temporary \naccommodations unchanged at 1.125%, 1.5%, and 3.375%, respectively, and to adjust the \nBank’s selective credit control measures.",
        "The  board  directors  and  supervisors  approved  unanimously  to  issue  the  following  press \nrelease in the post-meeting press conference, together with the Supplementary Materials for the \nPost-Monetary Policy Meeting Press Conference prepared by the Bank.",
        "Since  the  Board  met  in  December  last  year,  the  coronavirus  (COVID-19)  pandemic  has \ngradually been brought under control, leading to a gradual recovery in global economic and \ntrade  activities,  coupled  with  an  uptrend  in  international  crude  oil  and  other  commodity \nprices.",
        "International institutions project the world economy to return to positive growth this \nyear and inflation to pick up mildly.",
        "Amid expectations of a global economic recovery and \nthe US government’s US$1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus package, recent inflation expectations \nin  the  US  have  strengthened  markedly,  driving  up  long-term  government  bond  yields  of \nmajor economies, and in turn causing greater volatility in international stock markets.",
        "As  the  pandemic  still  weigh  on  economic  activity,  major  economies  have  maintained  an \naccommodative  monetary  policy  stance  and  continued  with  expansionary  fiscal  policies.",
        "According  to  international  forecasting  institutions,  global  economic  growth  is  likely  to \nrebound in 2021.",
        "However, a string of uncertainties such as the coverage and effectiveness \nof vaccination, a possible tightening of financial conditions induced by recent rises in long-\nterm  bond  yields  of  major  economies,  financial  fragilities  including  considerably  high \nlevels of global debt, the development of US-China relations, and climate change risks still \ncast a long shadow over the global economic outlook.",
        "From  the  beginning  of  this  year,  continuously  buoyant  demand  for  electronic  parts  and \ncomponents  and  information  and  communication  products,  as  well  as  stronger  sales  of \ntraditional manufacturing merchandise, boosted Taiwan’s export growth substantially.",
        "With \nrespect to domestic demand, labor market conditions remained stable and the \nunemployment rate dropped, while consumer confidence went up and retail sales continued \ngrowing.",
        "Taiwan’s  high-tech  manufacturers  increased  capital  expenditure,  leading  to  an \nexpansion  in  capital  equipment  imports.",
        "These  developments  indicated  solid  domestic \neconomic growth.",
        "Looking  at the  year  as a whole, Taiwan’s  export growth is expected to  gather pace amid \nfaster recoveries across major economies, benefiting also from a sustained boom in global \ndemand  for  emerging  technology  applications  and  for  remote-work  technologies.",
        "Private \ninvestment would gain momentum from stronger exports and expand further, while private \nconsumption  would  likely  grow  moderately  thanks  to  the  economic  upturn  at  home.",
        "The \nBank forecasts that Taiwan’s economy would expand by 4.53% in 2021 (Appendix Table 1).",
        "For  the  first  two  months  of  the  year,  the  annual  growth  rate  of  the  consumer  price  index \n(CPI)  averaged  0.59%,  and  the  core  CPI  (excluding  fruit,  vegetables,  and  energy  items) \nincreased  at  an  annual  pace  of  0.84%.",
        "For  the  year  as  a  whole,  inflation  is  expected  to \nrebound as import prices trend up on the back of global price recoveries for oil and other \nraw  materials  and  surging  international  freight  charges.",
        "Domestic  consumption  is  also \nexpected to increase moderately.",
        "The  Bank projects the CPI and core CPI annual growth \nrates to be 1.07% and 0.77%, respectively, indicating a mild inflation outlook (Appendix \nTable 2).",
        "In  the  domestic  financial  system,  liquidity  remained  ample,  and  banks’  excess  reserves \nstayed  above  NT$50  billion  recently.",
        "Meanwhile,  the  average  annual  growth  rate  of  the \nmonetary aggregate M2 moved above 8%, higher than the Bank’s reference range of 2.5%-\n6.5%.",
        "While short-term market interest rates fluctuated slightly, Taiwan’s government bond \nyields tracked the uptrend of US Treasury yields and edged up.",

        "An  overall  assessment  of  the  economic  and  financial  conditions  at  home  and  abroad \nincluded  a  global  economic  recovery  still  faced  with  significant  uncertainties,  continued \nmonetary easing and large fiscal stimuluses in major economies, mild domestic price trends \nand  inflation  outlook,  and  the  prospect  of  a  solid  economic  expansion.",
        "In  this  view,  the \nBoard  judged  that  a  rate  hold  would  help  sustain  price  and  financial  stability  and  foster \neconomic growth.",

        "However,  banks’  real  estate  lending  continued  to  increase \nmarkedly.",
        "Therefore,  with  the  aim  of  stemming  an  inordinately  high  flow  of  bank  credit \ninto the real estate sector and further reining in credit risk of such lending, the Bank decided \nto introduce the following amendments (Appendix), effective March 19, 2021:          \n(1) Lowering the LTV ratio cap on housing loans extended to corporate entities: capped \nat 40%.",
        "Adjusting provisions on housing loans extended to individuals (natural persons):   \nLowering the LTV ratio cap on a third housing loan from 60% to 55%; introducing a \nnew LTV cap of 50% on a fourth (or more) housing loan (previously subject to a 60% \ncap).",
        "Lowering the LTV ratio cap on high-value housing loan from 60% to 55%; introducing \na  new  LTV  cap  of  40%  on  a  fourth  (or  more)  housing  loan  (previously  subject  to  a \n60% cap) extended to a borrower with three outstanding housing loans.",

        "Thereafter, as the domestic coronavirus outbreak remained contained, the indices for “future outlooks” (for the following six months) under Taiwan’s Manufacturing PMI (Purchasing Managers’ Index) and NMI (Non-Manufacturing Index) both continued to rise, pointing to stable outlooks as anticipated by businesses and a likely upturn in domestic economic growth in the latter half of the year.",
        "With respect to external demand in the year so far, while most major Asian economies recorded year-on-year (yoy) export declines owing to soft demand amid the pandemic and US- China disputes, Taiwan’s exports grew by 1.5% yoy during Jan.-Aug. on the back of restocking demand from Chinese firms and orders for products of emerging technologies and remote work tools.",
        "That same reason, combined with gradual reopening in many economies, also further boosted Taiwan’s exports more recently.",
        "Therefore, the Bank expected Taiwan’s real exports to contract less in the second half year and to register negative growth for the year as a whole, while gaining momentum next year.",
        "In regard to domestic demand, supported by capital expenditure expansion by semiconductor and ICT (information and communication technology) firms and the government’s “Three Major Programs for Investing in Taiwan,” the Bank expected real private investment to exhibit steady growth in the second half of the year and for the year as a whole,\nand to grow slightly slower next year owing to a higher base effect.",
        "Meanwhile, taking into account domestic success in containing the outbreak and the government’s stimulus measures, the Bank projected that real private consumption would stabilize in the second half year, albeit still in contraction for the year as a whole, but would post mild positive growth next year.",
        "As for labor market conditions, waning coronavirus cases and ongoing government programs to help affected workers and to bolster employment combined to bring the unemployment rate down from a peak in May and the number of employed persons up moderately, with a smaller fraction of furloughed employees and a slightly eased jobs squeeze.",
        "Overall, the Bank revised the forecast for this year’s GDP growth rate slightly upward to 1.60% based on brighter prospects for growth in fixed investment and exports compared to the previous (June) forecast.",
        "For the year of 2021, the Bank projected the economy to grow faster by 3.28% as exports and private consumption resume positive growth.",
        "Projections for Taiwan’s GDP growth rate in 2020 by major forecasting institutions fell between -1.36% and 1.83%, and all of them expected next year’s growth to be faster, with projections ranging from 1.40% to 3.92%.",
        "From July on, with ample market liquidity, short-term interest rates experienced moderate fluctuations and the average level of bank excess reserves stayed between NT$40 billion to NT$60 billion.",
        "In terms of money supply, the monetary aggregate M2 increased by 4.72% on average for the first seven months of the year, remaining in line with the Bank’s M2 growth reference range, because of a smaller net resident capital outflow and faster growth in bank loans and investment.",
        "In terms of bank credit, as banks had continued to extend more SME relief loans and loans to affected workers, mortgage loans, and land and construction loans had all increased since the second quarter, the annual growth rate of bank loans and investments reached 7.19% at the end of July, with SME loans growing by 11.86%.",
        "In sum, for the year to date, M2 and bank credit exhibited stable growth, indicating that credit market had sufficient liquidity to support real economic activity.",
        "In the housing market, prices of new housing projects and existing homes both rose higher in the second quarter compared to the same period last year, with a more marked price rise in\nthe former type of housing.",
        "Housing transactions in the six Special Municipalities increased moderately in the first eight months compared to the same period last year.",
        "Real estate lending also continued to increase, posting an annual growth rate of 8.2% at the end of July.",
        "Among the subcategories, construction loans grew relatively faster year on year, mainly because construction firms acquired more land lots to meet potential property demand amid an influx of returning investments by overseas Taiwanese businesses.",
        "Compared to the end of last year, the level of concentration of real estate lending increased slightly as of the end of July.",
        "In the year so far, bank lending standards became somewhat relaxed, the loan-to-value ratio rose modestly, and the mortgage interest rate dropped.",
        "However, asset quality for mortgage loans remained stable.",
        "The non-performing loan (NPL) ratio of home-purchase loans of domestic banks stood at 0.15% in July, lower than the NPL ratio of all loans, which was 0.25%.",
        "With the pandemic easing and market liquidity in abundance, confidence of homebuilders and homebuyers grew.",
        "The banking sector now held a more optimistic view regarding the outlook for residential housing market in major metropolitans within the next 12 months, while the view on the high-value housing market was still cautious, albeit somewhat better than previously surveyed.",
        "As domestic fuel and other energy prices decreased amid the pandemic-induced slump in international oil prices and hospitality businesses reduced prices to attract customers, the CPI annual growth rate stayed negative for several months before starting to climb back up from June onwards.",
        "For the first eight months of the year, the CPI annual growth rate averaged -0.27% mainly owing to energy price cuts.",
        "Rises in fruit, rent, and food away from home prices partially offset the decline.",
        "Despite recent consecutive negative CPI annual growth rates, a lot more items in the CPI basket of goods and services exhibited price rises than those items with price declines, indicating that there was barely a broad-based price downtrend, nor pronounced signs of deflation.",
        "Survey-based inflation expectation indicator also showed that the public expected prices to rise in the next six months.",
        "For the latter half of the year, as countries resumed economic activity and oil price downtrend eased, the Bank forecasted a rebound in inflation from the third quarter on.",
        "For next year, inflation would likely rise further, boosted by a global economic recovery, an oil price rebound, and mild growth in domestic demand.",
        "Nevertheless, a negative output gap and muted inflationary pressures were still in sight.",
        "The Bank forecasted the CPI and core CPI annual growth rates to be -0.20% and 0.24% this year before rising to 0.92% and 0.62% next year, respectively.",
        "Major forecasting institutions mostly expected inflation to be slightly below zero this year and to rise mildly next year.",
        "Among the factors affecting future domestic price trends, upside pressure sources include (1) international freight rates and raw material (such as oil) prices rise back up as countries around the world reopened the economy; (2) domestic prices of tourism, lodging, and restaurant services rebound, boosted by relatively low coronavirus cases at home and the government’s consumption stimulus measures.",
        "On the other hand, persistently low communication fees and a still negative output gap could exert downside pressures on prices.",
        "Domestic inflation has been stabilizing and the output gap is expected to be modestly negative next year.",
        "In sum, the inflation outlook is mild.",
        "The Bank forecasts the annual growth rates of CPI and core CPI to be -0.20% and 0.24% this year before rising to 0.92% and 0.62% next year.",
        "The global economic outlook remains shrouded in numerous uncertainties.",
        "Nonetheless, with exports gaining momentum and domestic demand rebounding amid the eased pandemic situation at home, economic growth is expected to pick up in the second half of the year and advances further at a mild pace next year.",
        "The Bank forecasts the economy to expand by 1.60% in 2020 and to grow faster by 3.28% in 2021.",
        "Compared to major economies, Taiwan’s economy would be in better shape both this and next year.",
        "Policy Proposition: To keep the discount rate, the rate on refinancing of secured loans, and the rate on temporary accommodations unchanged at 1.125%, 1.5%, and 3.375%, respectively.",
        "Board members reached a unanimous vote to keep the policy rates unchanged.",
        "Regarding domestic economic conditions, several board directors shared their views.",
        "One board director pointed out that, while the Bank slightly upgraded the 2020 economic growth rate forecast and expected a further pickup next year, the growth momentum would still be tepid and a negative output gap remained.",
        "Moreover, for the year to date, export growth would have turned negative when excluding electronic parts/components or those shipped to China.",
        "The coronavirus pandemic represents the greatest uncertainty over Taiwan’s economic outlook.",
        "Some businesses were more optimistic, expecting COVID-19 vaccines to be released soon; some were pessimistic, concerned that it would take about two years before tourism and aviation sectors bounce back.",
        "Another board director added that the probability for a domestic recession this year was chiefly under 40% according to the results of the forecasting model.",
        "One board director presented two points of views regarding the future development of domestic economic growth.",
        "First, Taiwan’s exports had performed generally well within the past year.",
        "However, the degree of export concentration by product and by destination came to be the highest in 20 years.",
        "Such high concentration implied that Taiwan’s exports are vulnerable to changes in one or several particular industries or markets.",
        "It is important to heed potential impacts therefrom on further domestic economic growth.",
        "Second, private investment had also posted good growth both last year and this year so far, with over 30% of that growth coming from capital equipment imports.",
        "Since the semiconductor sector accounted for more than 40% of those imports, it was expected to continue to be the key driver of private investment growth.",
        "However, the semiconductor industry is known to be cyclical, and the industry’s bust cycle would bode ill for private investment growth.",
        "Therefore, policymakers should ponder on how to boost investment by other industries and avoid overconcentration in a specific few sectors.",
        "With regard to domestic financial conditions, two board directors discussed the implementation and outcome of the Bank’s special SME re-accommodation facility.",
        "One of them stated that, with the exception of the electronics industry, traditional businesses (not only SMEs) were having a difficult time amid the pandemic.",
        "In that view, perhaps the Bank could explore other means – in addition to expanding the special facility and/or adjusting policy rates – to help\nthe impacted industries.",
        "The other director noted that judging by the actual situation in banks, individuals or companies would still be conscious of the fact that loans taken out under the government’s relief program or the Bank’s special facility still incur interest payments (even if the preferential rates are low) and would be cautious not to borrow except when in need.",
        "It would then require attention to whether, by the expiry of the relief loan programs or interest subsidy schemes, a clear recovery would have arrived and whether potential borrowers would still have funding needs that could be helped by these policies.",
        "Several board directors discussed the developments in the domestic housing market.",
        "One director pointed out that current financial conditions were accommodative both at home and abroad, and the US Fed might keep policy rates close to zero at least till 2023.",
        "Under the circumstances, the Bank needs to heed the signs of bubbles forming in financial assets and the real estate market, and put together precautionary policies or formulate response measures.",
        "Another board director stated that the Bank should closely monitor the changes in the housing market and would better act preemptively before public expectations of home-price rises become palpable.",
        "Once that expectation takes hold, it would be difficult to reverse the trend even with loan-to-value restrictions or tax-based policies.",
        "One of the board directors observed that the housing market had so far been orderly.",
        "Another board director raised the concern that some of the funds repatriated by overseas Taiwanese businessmen through regular channels instead of using preferential statutory means could have flowed into the real estate market.",
        "One director noted that the government should address housing market issues with a comprehensive strategy, one that encompasses not only the Bank’s policy tools (such as LTV caps) but also relevant policy actions by central and local agencies (such as the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of the Interior, and local governments), so as to achieve and ensure effectiveness.",
        "A number of board directors believed that the Bank should continue to monitor changes in housing prices, and gave their views on the indicators helpful in making the decision to adopt selective credit controls.",
        "Among them, one director stated that the Bank should closely watch the property market and banks’ real estate lending, and consult the banking sector extensively about their views.",
        "And if deemed necessary after the Bank’s cautious and comprehensive assessment against these information, selective credit controls should then be put in place.",
        "All board directors expressed support for keeping the policy rates unchanged against a backdrop of lingering uncertainty over the global economic outlook, a steady domestic economic recovery, and ample market liquidity.",
        "One board director noted that, in terms of economic fundamentals, major countries were gradually bouncing back and a domestic economic recovery was expected to gather pace quarter by quarter.",
        "In terms of the coronavirus pandemic, the outbreak here was not as severe as many other economies.",
        "As to liquidity conditions, given ample liquidity in the financial system, a rate cut would have rather limited effects.",
        "The director therefore favored a rate hold.",
        "Another board director mentioned that while many major central banks already cut their policy rates to levels close to or below zero, Taiwan’s policy rates remained above zero.",
        "Nevertheless, the domestic stock market was sound, the economy continued posting positive growth, and the pandemic was broadly kept at bay.",
        "In all, the director supported a rate hold decision.",
        "One board director noted that against a backdrop of moderate economic growth and muted inflationary pressures, there existed no room for a rate hike.",
        "However, considering that the currently low rates also left little room for a rate cut, it would be the appropriate decision to keep policy rates unchanged.",
        "One board director viewed that maintaining low rates at home should be in order given lingering uncertainties over the global economy.",
        "Nevertheless, the policy rates had come to historical lows and thus a further reduction would not be productive, neither would a rate hike be justified in the current circumstances.",
        "The director supported a rate hold decision, citing mainly a multitude of uncertainties and less-than-strong momentum for the domestic rebound.",
        "Several board directors expressed support for a rate hold decision and discussed recent NT dollar exchange rate movements.",
        "One board director pointed to the spillover effect of the US monetary easing policy having a world-wide impact and noted that a small open economy like Taiwan would be especially vulnerable.",
        "In particular, the NT dollar would continue to face upside pressures and a stronger NTD would be detrimental to traditional industries.",
        "Thoughts should be put into finding other ways to help these industries stay afloat.",
        "One board director pointed out that domestic economic growth was mainly buttressed by robust exports of electronic parts/components and ICT products.",
        "In contrast, the director noted that traditional sectors were affected by a more marked local currency appreciation, wary of a stronger currency weakening industry competitiveness.",
        "However, the corporate sector seemed to have a broad-based support for the policy of holding the policy rates unchanged and maintaining dynamic stability of the exchange rate.",
        "One board director noted that, compared to 2018 and 2019, the NT dollar appreciation recently was more marked than that of the Korean won, which might have caused traditional businesses to underperform.",
        "On the other hand, electronics exports, the driving force of Taiwan’s exports, continued growing despite a stronger NT dollar, suggesting that it was not a required condition for exchange rates to stay at a certain level.",
        "Suppose the policy rates stay unchanged, the Bank should take a holistic approach to its exchange rate policy and consider the overall industry development in the face of the issue of appropriate exchange rate levels, with the optimal exchange rate not being a fixed one.",
        "At present, a policy rate hold would be the right path, while in the vein of exchange rate policy the Bank would still need to plan ahead.",
        "Monetary Policy Decision: The board directors reached a unanimous vote to keep the discount rate, the rate on refinancing of secured loans, and the rate on temporary accommodations unchanged at 1.125%, 1.5%, and 3.375%, respectively.",
        "The board directors and supervisors approved unanimously to issue the following press release in the post-meeting press conference, together with the Supplementary Materials for the Post-Monetary Policy Meeting Press Conference prepared by the Bank.",
        "Since the Board met in June this year, various countries where the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic appeared to have eased have gradually lifted lockdown measures.",
        "The global economy showed signs of bottoming out, while international oil prices stabilized and global inflation rebounded.",
        "Major economies successively rolled out large-scale fiscal stimulus measures and maintained accommodative monetary policies to help restore normal economic activity.",
        "With ample global liquidity, international stock markets fluctuated and trended up, and long-term government bond yields remained at low levels.",
        "Meanwhile, the US dollar index experienced a downtrend, and currencies of major economies broadly appreciated against the US dollar.",
        "A multitude of uncertainties such as recurrent coronavirus outbreaks in several economies in recent months, intensified US-China tensions, heightened global financial fragilities, and lingering geopolitical risks still cast a long shadow over the outlook for global economic and trade recovery.",
        "International institutions project the world economy to contract sharply this year and resume growth next year, albeit still below the pre-pandemic level.",
        "Domestic economic and financial conditions\nTaiwan's exports increased faster from July onwards thanks to robust outbound sales of electronic parts and components and information and communication products.",
        "Services exports, however, were constrained by a sharp decline of inbound visitors as some of the pandemic-related border controls remained in place.",
        "In terms of domestic demand, government stimulus measures and improved consumer confidence helped lift retail sales out of contraction.",
        "In addition, private investment rose steadily, led by capital expenditure expansions by semiconductor firms and the information and communication industry.",
        "As domestic economic growth would likely gain stronger momentum in the second half of the year, the Bank forecasts that for the entire year the economy would grow by 1.60% (Appendix Table 1).",
        "Meanwhile, labor market conditions improved slightly as the pandemic eased in Taiwan and the government's workers relief programs and job support measures began to show positive effects.",
        "Looking ahead to next year, Taiwan's export growth is expected to gather pace as major trading partners see their economies stabilize and companies continue to build up capacity locally.",
        "Private consumption would likely grow mildly amid an economic recovery.",
        "Private investment, while continuing to rise next year, would slow slightly compared with this year because of a higher base effect.",
        "Overall, the Bank forecasts that Taiwan's economic growth would advance at a faster pace of 3.28% in 2021.",
        "For the first eight months of the year, the average annual growth rate of the consumer price index (CPI) was -0.27%, mainly owing to domestic energy price cuts amid international oil price slumps.",
        "The core CPI (excluding fruit, vegetables, and energy) recorded an average annual growth rate of 0.24%.",
        "Inflation is expected to stabilize in the latter half of this year, supported by a rebound in international raw material prices and a pickup in domestic consumer spending.",
        "For this year as a whole, the Bank forecasts the CPI and core CPI annual growth rates to be -0.20% and 0.24%, respectively (Appendix Table 2).",
        "The Bank projects that in 2021 the CPI and core CPI annual growth rates would rise to 0.92% and 0.62% respectively, noting the global economic recovery, higher oil prices as anticipated by international forecasters, and mild consumption demand at home.",
        "The domestic financial system continued to enjoy ample liquidity; market interest rates, both long- and short-term, fluctuated modestly in recent months.",
        "Meanwhile, banks' excess reserves stayed at levels between NT$40 billion and NT$60 billion.",
        "In terms of credit support to help counter the economic impact of the pandemic, there were relief loan programs for both employers and employees implemented by the government.",
        "The Bank also announced an NT$200 billion special accommodation facility to support lending to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), launched on April 1, 2020.",
        "So far, banks have processed 152,447 loan applications totaling NT$164.6 billion, showing that this facility has been helping to ensure smooth bank credit flows to SMEs.",
        "At the end of July, the annual growth rate of bank loans and investments was 7.19%, with loans to SMEs increasing by 11.86% year on year.",
        "For the first seven months of the year, the average annual growth rates of the monetary aggregate M2 and of bank loans and investments were 4.72% and 5.91%, respectively, indicating that money and credit conditions were sufficient to support domestic economic activity.",
        "The assessment of domestic and foreign economic and financial conditions shows that inflation is increasingly steady and the inflation outlook is mild, along with a slightly negative output gap next year.",
        "Our economic growth would pick up in the latter half of this year and continue to expand moderately next year with exports strengthening and domestic demand reinvigorated as the domestic COVID-19 situation remains under control.",
        "Compared with major economies, Taiwan's economy is projected to be relatively resilient in both 2020 and 2021.",
        "Against this backdrop, the Board judges that a policy rate hold and a continued accommodative monetary policy stance would help sustain price and financial stability and foster economic growth.",
        "At the Meeting today, the Board decided unanimously to keep the discount rate, the rate on refinancing of secured loans, and the rate on temporary accommodations unchanged at 1.125%, 1.50%, and 3.375%, respectively.",
        "In view of elevated uncertainty over the economic and financial conditions of the world, the Bank will continue to closely monitor the future course of the coronavirus pandemic, monetary policy actions taken by major economies and the outcomes of their stimulus measures, the developments concerning the US-China relations, changes in the global financial markets, and the implications thereof for Taiwan's economy, financial conditions, and price trends.",
        "The Bank will adopt appropriate monetary policies as warranted to achieve its statutory duties.",
        "The NT dollar exchange rate is in principle determined by market forces.",
        "Recently, large and erratic foreign capital flows have caused greater volatility in Taiwan's foreign exchange market.",
        "The Bank will pay close attention to cross-border capital movements and act in line with its mandate to maintain an orderly foreign exchange market and safeguard financial market stability.",
        "Since the start of the year 2020, the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak had disrupted global supply chains and weakened world trade and global demand.",
        "As the real economy took a hit, major forecasting institutions slashed their projections on global economic growth for the year.",
        "Not only was it difficult to predict the degree of the severity, the ramifications seemed to be multiplying.",
        "As the pandemic raged through the world, most economies saw steep cuts to their domestic growth forecasts, with the United States, the euro area, and Japan recently projected by international forecasters to register negative growth.",
        "To shore up economic growth and combat the pandemic’s fallout, major economies such as the US and the United Kingdom reduced policy rates; the euro area and Japan introduced further monetary easing; fiscal expansion was also adopted in major economies.",
        "Devastated by the coronavirus outbreak escalation, major stock markets plunged and the VIX “fear index” spiked to historical highs.",
        "While most major currencies weakened against the US dollar, the depreciation in the NT dollar was relatively limited.",
        "International oil prices tumbled on supply-demand imbalances and virus-related impacts, weighing down on the global inflation outlook.",
        "Inflation forecasts for advanced economies mostly got trimmed, whereas China’s inflation could be driven further upwards by the African swine fever epidemic.",
        "Looking ahead, the global economy faces rising downside risks that would cloud financial market stability and the economic and trade outlook, including (1) negative spillovers from the coronavirus pandemic; (2) an unsettled future of trade talks among major economies; (3) persistent geopolitical conflicts and extreme weather threats.",
        "As the virus outbreak hindered supply chains and dampened service sector activity, the indices for “future outlooks” (in the following six months) under Taiwan’s Manufacturing PMI (Purchasing Managers’ Index) and NMI (Non-Manufacturing Index) both dropped sharply, indicating that businesses began to see a gloomier future.",
        "In terms of external demand, emerging technology applications and high-end semiconductor development provided a boost to demand that would keep the export engine running.",
        "However, given supply chain disruptions amid the ongoing pandemic, recent slumps in international crude prices, and a drastic drop in the number of inbound travelers, the Bank expected limited real export growth for this year.",
        "In terms of domestic demand, private investment was shored up by machinery equipment investment and government-led initiatives.",
        "Nevertheless, considering that investment plans could be interrupted by this pandemic, as well as a higher base effect, the Bank forecasted a moderation in real private investment growth.",
        "As to private consumption, the virus outbreak sapped consumer confidence and the job market.",
        "Taiwan’s service NMI plummeted in February, with hospitality and food & beverage services suffering the sharpest fall.",
        "The impact on workers’ pay could further weigh on private spending.",
        "In this view, the Bank forecasted weak real growth in private consumption.",
        "Overall, the Bank expected the economy to be encumbered by the corornavirus outbreak for the first half of 2020 as manufacturing supply chains and the service sector were hampered.",
        "For the second half of the year, assuming a steady recovery in production as global supply chains revive and an increase in some swaths of consumer spending to meet pent-up demand, coupled with government relief and stimulus measures, Taiwan’s exports and private consumption could see faster growth as a result, adding fuel to a rebound in economic growth.",
        "The Bank forecasted the domestic economy to expand by 1.92% this year, lower by 0.65 percentage points from the previous forecast in December 2019.",
        "The growth projections made by major forecasting institutions for Taiwan this year ranged between 1.05% and 2.37%.",
        "Domestic short-term interest rates were broadly stable.",
        "In recent months, the level of banks’ net excess reserves stayed around NT$45-NT$55 billion.",
        "As the coronavirus pandemic spread further, the US Federal Reserve made significant rate cuts and reinstituted quantitative easing, causing the yield spread between Taiwanese and US bonds to decrease considerably.",
        "Based on the experience during the global financial crisis, such a development could increase cross-border capital movements, result in currency pressures and financial turmoil, and disrupt the real economy.",
        "Amid the evolving pandemic, the Bank paid close attention to credit conditions of small and medium-sized enterprises.",
        "While 50% to 60% of the 1.47 million SMEs in Taiwan relied on bank lending, they usually had a weaker credit quality and their operations were vulnerable to a virus outbreak like COVID-19.",
        "Meanwhile, their funding sources – banks – could be conservative in extending credit to the less credit-worthy SME borrowers, leaving them in straitened circumstances because of limited financing channels.",
        "Take for instance electronic parts and components firms, which could easily fall victim to a supply dislocation.",
        "With more than 80% of them being SMEs, they could run into financial problems if the virus-induced supply chain disruptions hinder production and sales and erode their revenues.",
        "Moreover, the hospitality and food & beverage industries comprise mostly SMEs, whose financial hardship owing to dwindling sales during the outbreak could be exacerbated by decreased funding from banks.",
        "The consumer price index (CPI) rose mildly, registering an average annual growth rate of 0.81% for the first two months of the year.",
        "As domestic demand was soft and the negative output gap widened, inflationary pressures were subdued.",
        "Meanwhile, local consumer demand was impaired as the virus outbreak persisted; some service providers tried to lure customers with lower prices.",
        "Moreover, international prices of crude oil and other raw materials trended downward.",
        "In this view, the Bank projected the CPI and core CPI annual growth rates to be 0.59% and 0.55% this year, with risks to the inflation outlook tilting to the downside.",
        "In regard to the key determinants of future price trends, upside pressures could stem from (1) a minimum wage hike implemented early in the year, which would drive up prices in services, and (2) faster rises in food prices including fruit and vegetables, owing to a lower base effect from last year’s favorable weather conditions.",
        "Sources of downside pressures include (1) the spread of the coronavirus pandemic would suppress international commodity prices and restrain domestic consumer demand; (2) domestic communication service providers continue with fee reduction; (3) the domestic output gap slips into deeper negative territory.",
        "A need to help businesses stay in normal operation and to sustain confidence of households and businesses: \nThe coronavirus pandemic impacted the domestic economy, including production and supply disruptions that affected the manufacturing sector and decreased consumption that hurt some parts of the service sector.",
        "SMEs in particular could fare even worse given the deterioration in financing with negative consequences for the job market.",
        "Potential adverse implications for financial stability owing to massive capital movements: \nIn terms of currency values against the US dollar, the NT dollar showed relative strength recently, whereas currencies of major economies experienced larger depreciations.",
        "The yield spread between Taiwan and US bonds became smaller.",
        "Under the circumstances, large capital flows could move to Taiwan, carrying adverse implications for the foreign exchange market, financial stability, and the real economy.",
        "Policy Propositions: To establish a Special Accommodation Facility to Support Bank Credit to SMEs (hereinafter the Special SME Accommodation Facility, or the Facility) and to reduce the discount rate, the rate on accommodations with collateral, and the rate on accommodations without collateral by 0.25 percentage points to 1.125%, 1.5%, and 3.375%, respectively.",
        "Board members reached a unanimous decision for the Special SME Accommodation Facility and the policy rate reduction.",
        "The discussions are summarized as follows.",
        "Discussion on domestic and international economic and financial conditions\nSeveral board directors gave views on the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on Taiwan’s macroeconomic and price conditions.",
        "One board director pointed out that the first shockwaves hit production lines and, given China’s status as the world’s manufacturing hub, threatened supply chain disruptions.",
        "This concern was expected to abate after the end of March since Taiwanese firms had assessed that China would restart production around that time.",
        "However, the corornavirus then spread to Europe and the United States, adding consumption strains to the list of virus-related problems.",
        "With looming uncertainties, corporate buyers in major advanced economies – the US, Europe, and Japan – became rather cautious in placing orders or even asked their suppliers, including those in Taiwan, to put deliveries on hold.",
        "This would affect the operations of domestic firms and even the self-employed.",
        "One board director noted that the coronavirus impact was all-pervasive, battering a myriad of sectors including manufacturing and services.",
        "In the manufacturing sector, the industry of electronic parts and components was so closely integrated with the supply chains in China that it could run into a supply bottleneck.",
        "Financially strapped SMEs could even be forced to close down.",
        "The service sector was experiencing a wider range of repercussions with consumers hesitant to go out and spend.",
        "Another board director shared a similar view that this outbreak had dealt a huge blow to Taiwan’s economy in many areas including consumption, investment, and exports.",
        "One board director commented in regard to the virus impact on prices, stating that despite downside pressures from international oil slumps and soft domestic consumer spending, this pandemic could cause upside pressures.",
        "As lockdowns and travel bans restricted the movement of goods and people, merchandise costs would increase and commodity exports and imports would be obstructed, both of which could push up domestic prices.",
        "All board directors expressed support for the policy rate reduction and the introduction of the Special SME Accommodation Facility.",
        "One board director pointed to the current environment where Taiwan’s SMEs were having difficulties because of the virus outbreak.",
        "The policy rate cut would bring down not only the deposit rates but also the lending rates.",
        "Therefore, by lowering the interest rates and deploying the new Facility, the Bank could help the SMEs obtain the working capital needed to continue business operation.",
        "This policy was not aimed at spurring consumption or investment, but rather to alleviate pressures for SMEs under stress.",
        "Moreover, as households and businesses could both enjoy the benefits of this policy, it would help support business operations and buttress household confidence.",
        "Several board directors gave their opinions regarding the implications and size of rate cuts, as well as future monetary policy space.",
        "With respect to the implications of rate cuts, two board directors, while expressing support for the rate cut, stated that although a rate cut was expected to provide a limited boost to consumption or investment, it carried a much-needed announcement effect.",
        "A rate cut would indicate the Bank’s stance on easing and a commitment to ensure ample market liquidity.",
        "Another board director remarked that the actual effects of the discount rate policy have long been less than significant, and the announcement effect, if there indeed exists one, also seems to dull gradually.",
        "In regard to the size of cuts and future policy space, one board director observed that, limited effects aside, the fact that many central banks cut their policy rates by a large margin – the Fed’s 1.5 percentage points in particular – gave ground for supporting the proposed 0.25 percentage point reduction.",
        "Another board director noted that the market had widely expected a rate cut with this meeting.",
        "Notwithstanding the deeper cuts by other central banks, this director favored a rate cut by 0.25 percentage points based on practical considerations.",
        "One other board director stated that as major economies implemented rate reductions Taiwan should not lag behind too much, citing also the remaining room for lower rates as well as the announcement effect of the Bank’s policy stance.",
        "In addition, a rate cut would also help lighten the interest burdens on households and businesses.",
        "Therefore, cutting the policy rates by 0.25 percentage points would be the appropriate action.",
        "One board director pointed out that although the 0.25 percentage point cut was in line with an assessment of the current economic disruption, the Bank could face renewed rate cut pressures if the coronavirus outbreak persists.",
        "With the interest rates already at a relatively lower level, the future policy space will be limited.",
        "Another board director supported a rate cut given the high uncertainty about how long this pandemic will persist but suggested that a smaller reduction would be helpful in preserving future policy space.",
        "The board director also proposed that the Bank form a research group on monetary policy framework to take an all-encompassing view on the matter.",
        "Another board director added that the Bank has already set up an inter-department research group for this subject and will continue with related study work and enhance the monetary policy framework.",
        "One board director pointed out that the policy rates had stayed on hold for several years; although market expectation was a 0.25 percentage point reduction, too, it remained important for this rate cut decision to also consider the prospect of further easing or the possibility of deploying other policy tools.",
        "Another board director agreed with the rate cut decision, citing a forecast downgrade for domestic economic growth and an uncertain outlook.",
        "However, in view of the current low rates and to preserve room for further reductions, it seemed appropriate to consider a reduction of 0.125 percentage points instead.",
        "One board director pointed out that the recent waves of rate cuts by many economies had led to a narrower spread between interest rates in Taiwan and the US, which could give rise to a surge in short-term capital inflows.",
        "Moreover, the Bank had bucked the trend for several years by keeping the rates unchanged when other central banks eased.",
        "A rate cut decision this time would imply less room for future policy maneuver.",
        "Therefore, the cut should be considered in a broader context, including accounting for the aforementioned interest rate spread and short-term capital issues.",
        "Another board director noted that preemptive monetary policies require swift and brave actions.",
        "Even though monetary policy space could be smaller after this rate cut, Taiwan will not pursue negative interest rates.",
        "Furthermore, the fact that the policy response package encompassed a rate reduction and an accommodation facility revealed the true aim of this cut, which was to relieve the virus-induced stress and to help SMEs ride out the storm rather than to boost consumption or investment.",
        "Several board directors expressed their views about the effects, participating banks, lending rates, and eligible borrowers under the proposed Facility, as well as the procedures to adjust the Facility if needed.",
        "In terms of the effects, one board director pointed out that the gravest difficulty facing businesses now was a cash flow crunch.",
        "Therefore, creating a special credit line would bring about much help to businesses.",
        "Another board director also agreed that establishing the Special SME Accommodation Facility to provide NT$200 billion in lending was not only rightly warranted but also the right remedy.",
        "In terms of participants, one board director pointed to an inspiring sense of unity in Taiwan during the 2008 global financial crisis, when the government helped banks, banks helped businesses, and businesses helped workers – the kind of inspiration that should be re-created by the banking sector in the current crisis to turn the tide.",
        "The director gave support to the Facility but noted that private banks also need to be urged to participate proactively in this effort together, so as to genuinely assure businesses.",
        "Another board director added that the Bank will discuss the implementation details with banks, incorporate private banks into this program, and uses moral suasion.",
        "With government helping banks to help businesses, it showed the importance of the corporate sector.",
        "At present, some employers had to resort to hour cuts and furloughs, possibly for an extended period of time.",
        "By helping them to stay in operation, it would also help underpin the labor market.",
        "And though the proposed NT$200 billion Facility was preliminarily designed to run for a short term, an extension or expansion might be considered should the SMEs still remain financially strapped later on.",
        "One board director stated that against a backdrop of SMEs taking the brunt of the virus-induced impacts, state-owned banks are expected to fully cooperate with the Facility to help lift SMEs.",
        "Another board director commented that the central bank’s Special SME Accommodation Facility would be a great help.",
        "In addition to this Facility, as part of the government’s continued efforts to urge state-owned banks to give full support for SMEs, other central agencies introduced SME aid programs that could also expect keen cooperation from state-owned banks.",
        "With regard to lending rates, one board director gave the view that whether the lenders are state-owned banks or private ones, the aid efforts were not designed to make them take losses.",
        "One way to increase banks’ willingness to lend to the distressed SMEs would be to raise the guarantee ratio of the Small and Medium Enterprise Credit Guarantee Fund of Taiwan (SMEG), thereby mitigating lending risks and bringing down funding costs; it also seemed appropriate to allow banks to decide the levels of interest rates on such loans.",
        "Another board director urged that the Bank should reconsider the Facility’s ceiling on lending rates; instead of relying solely on moral suasion, the relief scheme should take into account banks’ willingness to lend.",
        "One board director showed support for the Facility but noted that the financial industry itself was also hampered by the coronavirus pandemic; it seemed appropriate if the lending rates are left to the discretion of participating banks.",
        "Another board director also remarked on the duration, amount, and loan rate ceiling of the Facility, stating that a lower ceiling on lending rates would make banks less willing to extend credit to SMEs; this director also pointed out that the Facility and the relief loan package by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) might have some overlapping features.",
        "With regard to the recipients of the loans, one board director explained that the MOEA’s relief package was aimed for those enterprises suffering more than a 15% contraction in revenues, while the Bank’s Facility would benefit a wider range of corporate borrowers in a way that would make bank credit assistance more inclusive.",
        "Another board director gave support to the Facility as this scheme and the MOEA’s package actually targeted different types of enterprises.",
        "Concerning adjustment to the Facility, one board director explained that much of its content (duration, amount, rate ceiling, etc.)",
        "was tentative, with flexibility for future changes.",
        "The Bank will, after the Facility’s passage at today’s Meeting, invite banks and relevant agencies including the SMEG to discuss the particulars of the Facility’s implementation and formulate practical applications to carry it out.",
        "Two board directors agreed that the Governor of the Bank may in his power make adjustments to the Facility, including the lending rates, the amount of accommodation, and other arrangements based on the actual implementation situation without calling a Board Meeting.",
        "Another board director pointed out that during the global financial crisis the Bank held six meetings during the four months of September through December instead of just the two scheduled quarterly meetings.",
        "Therefore, the Bank will hold Executive Directors Meetings or emergency Board Meetings outside the regular schedule when deemed necessary.",
        "Monetary Policy Decision: The board directors reached a unanimous vote to reduce the discount rate, the rate on accommodations with collateral, and the rate on accommodations without collateral by 0.25 percentage points each to 1.125%, 1.50%, and 3.375%, respectively.",
        "The board directors and supervisors approved unanimously to issue the following press release in the post-meeting press conference, together with the Supplementary Materials for the Post-Monetary Policy Meeting Press Conference prepared by the Bank.",
        "Since early this year, the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted global supply chains and weakened the growth momentum for international trade and consumption demand.",
        "Real economic activities have been widely affected and international financial markets have experienced dramatic volatility.",
        "Among international commodities, sharp declines in crude prices have exerted a downward pressure on global inflation.",
        "Moreover, factors such as the uncertain prospects for trade deal negotiations among major economies as well as geopolitical conflicts also substantially heighten downside risks to the global economy.",
        "International institutions have successively made significant downward revisions to forecasts for global economic growth this year.",
        "Given rising uncertainties surrounding the impact of the virus on global economic and financial conditions, major economies have recently adopted an accommodative monetary policy stance and announced expansionary fiscal policy to shore up economic growth.",
        "With the spread of the coronavirus, the global economy is expected to expand at a notably slower pace this year, which may undermine Taiwan's exports.",
        "In addition, the number of inbound visitors has drastically decreased, dampening growth in service exports.",
        "In terms of domestic demand, as the virus outbreak weighed on domestic consumer confidence and labor market conditions, private consumption expenditure is anticipated to be constrained.",
        "On the other hand, while investment plans in the manufacturing sector may also be affected, imports of capital equipment considerably increased in 2019, leading to a higher comparison base.",
        "Therefore, private investment is likely to register mild growth.",
        "As the coronavirus is projected to drag down the domestic economy in the first half of the year, the Bank revises down the growth forecast of Taiwan's economy to 1.07% for the first half of the year.",
        "If global supply chains gradually resume production in the second half of the year, export growth is likely to regain momentum.",
        "In addition, the rebound effect deriving from deferred private consumption, along with the government's relief and stimulus measures to bolster domestic demand, point to a possible pickup in domestic economic growth in the second half of the year.",
        "The Bank forecasts the domestic economy to expand by 1.92% in 2020 (Appendix Table 1).",
        "The developments of the COVID-19 outbreak will be a key variable for Taiwan's economy this year.",
        "For the first two months of the year, the consumer price index (CPI) and the core CPI (excluding fruit, vegetables, and energy items) registered average annual growth rates of 0.81% and 0.48%, respectively.",
        "In terms of the inflation outlook, considering the adverse impact on domestic consumption demand caused by the spread of the virus, combined with plunging international oil and raw material prices, the Bank trims the forecasts of the CPI and core CPI annual growth rates for 2020 to 0.59% and 0.55%, respectively (Appendix Table 2).",
        "The domestic financial system continues to enjoy ample liquidity and smooth functioning of financial intermediation.",
        "For the first two months of the year, the level of banks' net excess reserves stayed around NT$45-NT$55 billion and bank credit steadily increased.",
        "Short-term market interest rates generally moved around a lower level while long-term rates trended downwards.",
        "The coronavirus pandemic has caused global economic prospects to deteriorate drastically and international financial markets to fluctuate violently.",
        "On the domestic scene, manufacturers could face supply chain disruptions, and some parts of the service sector could run into problems from slowing business.",
        "Small- and medium-sized enterprises could particularly suffer if funding access turns limited, which could in turn weigh on employment.",
        "Meanwhile, with major currencies experiencing more marked depreciations, the NT dollar has shown relative strength.",
        "Therefore, to help support business continuity and to caution against the adverse implications of massive cross-border capital flows for financial stability, the Board judged that a policy rate cut was necessary.",
        "The Board also decided to set in place a special accommodation facility to help the SMEs to get through financial distress.",
        "These actions are expected to buttress confidence of households and businesses, to help sustain the smooth functioning of economic activity and to facilitate the Bank's efforts towards the fulfillment of its mandate.",
        "The Board reached the following decisions unanimously at the Meeting today:\nThe discount rate, the rate on accommodations with collateral, and the rate on accommodations without collateral will, effective March 20, 2020, be reduced by 0.25 percentage points to 1.125%, 1.50%, and 3.375%, respectively.",
        "The Bank will continue to closely monitor new developments of the coronavirus outbreak and the monetary policy actions by major economies, as well as the resultant effects on the economic and financial conditions at home and abroad.",
        "The Bank will, should the situation warrants, hold Executive Directors' Meetings or emergency Board Meetings outside the regular schedule and deploy monetary policy tools to act as appropriate to fulfilling its statutory mandates.",
        "Under the special accommodation facility, the Bank will, preliminarily, provide banks with additional funds of a total amount of NT$200 billion and at a rate of one percentage point lower than the policy rate on accommodations with collateral, in order to support credit extensions to SMEs.",
        "The interest rate charged on loans extended to SMEs under this facility would, preliminarily, be capped at the aforementioned rate on special accommodations plus one percentage point (Appendix 1).",
        "The Bank will regularly review the implementation of the facility and make timely adjustments as needed.",
        "Meanwhile, as part of the Bank's efforts to ensure continued availability of liquidity, banks may also use their holdings of the certificates of deposit (CDs) and negotiable certificates of deposit (NCDs) issued by the Bank to request early withdrawal or to take out secured loans.",
        "In case of emergency, the Bank's expanded repo facility, introduced in 2008 at the onset of the global financial crisis, could also be utilized to provide sufficient market access to liquidity.",
        "Under the broadened scope, securities firms and insurance companies are included as eligible counterparties in addition to banks and bills finance companies (Appendix 2).",
        "Banks with ample funds are urged to fulfill their roles as financial intermediaries and extend loans as needed to viable businesses.",
        "Taiwan has recently witnessed frequent short-term capital movements with adverse implications for the domestic forex and stock markets.",
        "The Bank will pay close attention to cross-border capital flows and act in line with its mandate to maintain an orderly foreign exchange market and safeguard financial market stability.",
        "The coronavirus outbreak is causing serious supply and demand shocks to the global economy.",
        "While the government has begun to introduce relief measures and stimulus programs, the Bank has also undertaken supportive actions with an easy monetary environment and a special SME accommodation facility.",
        "It is expected that the combined efforts would work in concert to promote steady growth for the Taiwan economy."

    "2018": [
        "Since the December 2017 Board Meeting, growth in the advanced and emerging market economies has continued to pick up; a steady global expansion is anticipated for this year, even outpacing last year according to the projections of international forecasting institutions.",
        "Although growth in global trade volume could slightly weaken year on year owing to China’s slowdown and growing world trade protectionism, it is projected to advance faster than global output, indicating that world trade is still thriving.",
        "Global inflation is expected to rise steadily amid continued global economic growth and rising raw material prices.",
        "Inflation in advanced economies is rising gradually, whereas South Korea and ASEAN countries could see slower price growth because of a higher comparison base the previous year.",
        "In the international financial markets, equity price volatility intensified at the beginning of the year but abated after mid-February, while VIX (the widely-followed measure of expected volatility) also dropped then and moved within a narrower range.",
        "The euro and Asian currencies broadly strengthened against the US dollar as positive economic prospects lured capital flows into the euro area and Asia.",
        "While the global economy looks set for further expansion, three major risks could still hamper this growth scenario: (1) steeper path of monetary policy normalization by major central banks (Fed, ECB, and BoJ); (2) economic and trade fallout from elevated protectionism; (3) aggravated financial market turbulence that weigh on global economic growth and market confidence, compounding the uncertainties surrounding the global economic outlook.",
        "Recent developments showed that the domestic economy is largely expanding at a moderate pace; leading indicators continued to rise, and both manufacturing and non-manufacturing firms maintained a positive business outlook.",
        "Labor market conditions have been stable, with a steady downtrend in the unemployment rate and a mild increase in the average wage.",
        "Overall, economic growth this year is expected to be driven by domestic demand, as contribution from net external demand will be crimped by a higher comparison base from last year’s export performance.",
        "The Bank forecasts Taiwan’s economy will grow 2.58% this year.",
        "For the first two months of the year, exports increased by 7.3%, thanks to a steady global economic expansion and a rise in international raw material prices.",
        "By product, base metal and articles thereof, electronic parts and components, and machinery were the main contributors to export growth.",
        "By market, exports to most of major destination economies registered positive growth.",
        "In general, although the demand for new technology applications, as well as continued global economic upturn, is likely to bolster exports of the related categories, Taiwan’s exports are expected to register mild growth this year due to a higher base effect.",
        "With corporate profits growing, employers might be more willing to increase hiring and hand out bonus pay.",
        "Strong consumer confidence will also stimulate spending.",
        "Therefore, private consumption is expected to gain more momentum and take the lead in bolstering this year’s economic growth.",
        "Private investment also exhibits brighter prospects.",
        "Firms are building up production capacity with greater investment in machinery and equipment as the global economy strengthens.",
        "Construction investment will benefit from an improving property sector and the government’s infrastructure spending, as well as a lower base effect.",
        "This year’s growth in private investment is anticipated to turn higher than the year before.",
        "The nominal market interest rates in Taiwan remained stable.",
        "The Bank managed market liquidity and helped keep bank reserves at an adequate level, and the overnight call loan rate of the banking sector was also steady.",
        "Taiwan’s real interest rate, though slipping into negative territory, is relatively moderate compared to a host of major economies.",
        "In terms of monetary growth, the M2 annual growth rate averaged 3.60% for the first two months of the year, within the Bank’s target range.",
        "In regard to bank credit in the year so far, bank lending to the private sector grew steadily, but the pace was slower than the previous year as some companies issued corporate debt to repay bank loans, locking in lower funding cost for a longer term.",
        "The average annual growth rate of bank loans and investments was 4.45% for the first two months of the year, higher than the sum of the 2018 projected GDP and CPI annual growth rates (3.85%), which indicates sufficient supply in the credit market.",
        "In recent months, narrow fluctuations in the domestic stock market, steady market interest rates, and a year-on-year decline in the real effective exchange rate index of the NT dollar represented easier financial conditions, as reflected in the uptrend of the Bank’s financial condition index.",
        "Meanwhile, housing transaction volume has gained a better footing, in tandem with price corrections.",
        "Looking ahead, Taiwan’s monetary growth this year might be affected by frequent cross-border capital flows on concerns that global financial stability and economic growth could be impaired by monetary policy normalization of major central banks, the US economic and trade policies, and the concomitant spread of protectionism from the US to the rest of the world.",
        "As for bank loans and investments, steady growth is expected, as continued domestic economic growth could reinforce demand for funding.",
        "International oil prices touched a three-year high in late January and later fluctuated at a lower, narrow range in line with the changes in US crude oil inventories.",
        "For the year as a whole, oil prices are going to move higher than last year according to forecasts by several international institutions.",
        "In terms of grains, unfavorable weather in key growing areas led to worries about lower crop yields, pushing up international grain futures prices in the year to date.",
        "In addition to international oil and grain prices, domestic consumer prices were also affected by the lingering effect of last year’s cigarette tax hike and recent rises in vegetable prices.",
        "For the first two months of the year, Taiwan’s consumer price index (CPI) posted an average annual growth rate of 1.54%, while the core CPI (excluding vegetables, fruit, and energy) grew 1.61%.",
        "Current inflation is mild.",
        "Generally speaking, the overall CPI changes tend to be more gradual than steep, whereas prices of individual commodity items could sometimes surge or slump.",
        "Moreover, what each household purchase and how often they make these purchases vary from one to the next.",
        "As a result, there is often a gap between price changes as gauged by the CPI and as perceived by the public.",
        "Among the items people buy more frequently, the prices of 17 consumer commodities, closely monitored by the Cabinet’s task force on price stabilization, have trended up recently and recorded an annual growth rate of 3.22% in February.",
        "The increase was mainly driven by steeper price rises in milk, eggs, pork, and poultry, and consumers tend to feel pinched when these items become more expensive.",
        "Despite the public perception, there was not an across-the-board increase but a mixed trend for different items.",
        "It is often the case that consumers are sensitive to price rises in what they buy more frequently (such as food products) and relatively unconcerned when those occasionally-purchased items (such as computers/communication/consumer electronics) exhibit price changes.",
        "For the first two months of this year, more frequently-purchased items (bought at least once every quarter) registered a higher CPI annual growth rate (3.87%) than the overall CPI annual growth rate (1.54%), which explains a stronger public concern for price rises.",
        "Meanwhile, although prices of some household paper products hiked to factor in international pulp price movements, and electricity rates are to be raised from April onwards to reflect higher costs of fuel imports for power generation, these factors only made a modest influence on the overall price trend.",
        "Nevertheless, close attention is warranted should inflation expectations become biased upwards.",
        "Moderate domestic demand has led the output gap, a key indicator of future inflation, to be negative, suggesting subdued inflationary pressures as reflected by the forecasts from major foreign and domestic institutions.",
        "The median of domestic institutions’ CPI forecasts is 1.18% and that of international institutions’ forecasts is 1.30%.",
        "According to the Bank’s forecasts, the CPI annual growth rate is projected to be 1.27% this year and core CPI is expected to rise 1.26%.",
        "The inflation outlook remains mild.",
        "As for key factors behind this year’s price trends, upside pressures might come from the following: (1) private sector pay increases spurred by rises in minimum wage and public sector wage a while earlier; (2) the effect of the cigarette tax hike carrying forward to the year-end; (3) an upsurge in food prices including vegetables and fruit owing to a lower comparison base the previous year; (4) higher inflation expectations as a result of the anticipation of global oil prices rises, a scheduled hike in electricity rates, and the recent price increases of some daily necessities.",
        "Sources of downside pressures include a continued downtrend of tele-communication rates and the persistence of a negative output gap.",
        "Current inflationary pressures and expected inflation are both mild\nThe annual CPI growth rate averaged 1.54% for the first two months of the year.",
        "International prices of crude oil and other raw materials are expected to move higher, and domestic prices might also be lifted by wage increases.",
        "On the other hand, the output gap remains negative, and demand-pull inflationary pressures are gentle.",
        "Overall, the inflation outlook is moderate, with the 2018 annual CPI growth rate projected to be 1.27% by the Bank.",
        "Taiwan’s real interest rate stands at an appropriate level compared to those of major economies \nUncertainties facing the global economic outlook might thwart domestic growth momentum \nAlthough the global economy is expected to pick up further, there remain uncertainties surrounding the outlook as well as financial stability, including monetary policy normalization by major central banks, intensifying international trade tension and protectionism, and greater volatility in financial asset prices.",
        "Domestic growth momentum could weaken slightly; actual output is below potential \nExports might grow a little more slowly because of a higher base effect, whereas domestic demand will be the key driving force of economic growth given a rebound in private investment and steady private consumption growth.",
        "According to the Bank’s forecast, this year’s economic growth rate will be a moderate 2.58%, slightly lower than last year’s 2.86%.",
        "Policy Proposition: To keep the discount rate, the rate on accommodations with collateral, and the rate on accommodations without collateral unchanged at 1.375%, 1.75%, and 3.625%, respectively.",

        "The discussions are summarized as follows.",
        "In respect of the international economic situation, several board directors expressed concerns that uncertainties over the global economic and trade outlook could affect Taiwan’s economic growth.",
        "One board director pointed out that, according to several recent studies on global risks published by major international institutions, the biggest source of global risks come from a potential trade war.",
        "If the US trade protectionism triggers retaliatory actions by the countries affected, then it would very likely spark a trade war.",
        "In this case, Taiwan’s economy could suffer direct impacts, while supply chain disruptions and a global economic downturn stemming from a trade war could also indirectly affect the domestic economy.",
        "Another board director cited the forecasts by international institutions and pointed out that while Europe, the US, and the world will register faster growth this year than last year, Asian economies, including Japan and China, will slightly decelerate.",
        "In the meantime, the global economic outlook remains clouded by many uncertainties.",
        "Future developments in protectionist measures and the effects of tax reforms in the US, geopolitical risks, and the fact that China has been investing significantly more to expand semiconductor production capacity could all undermine domestic economic growth.",
        "With regard to domestic economic conditions, a number of board directors noted that moderate momentum and uncertainties exist for the domestic economy.",
        "One board director pointed out that domestic forecasting institutions have just revised up this year’s growth projections for Taiwan, but the projected growth still trails last year’s performance.",
        "Another board director mentioned that domestic demand, Taiwan’s growth engine this year, has been picking up, but it is also important to monitor the progress and potential influence of pension reforms.",
        "In terms of domestic financial conditions, multiple board directors expressed their views regarding the housing market and home mortgage regulations imposed by the Bank.",
        "One board director noted that, since high-value housing projects tend to serve as a benchmark for pricing homes for sale, the Bank needs to continue monitoring high-value housing transactions in 2018 and 2019.",
        "Another board director observed that banks might in some cases loosen risk control over high-value home mortgages on account of the special qualifications of borrowers for such loans.",
        "Also, it is important to ensure housing justice.",
        "Therefore, this director considered it to be the right move to keep related regulations in place.",
        "One other board director expressed a similar view that restrictions on high-value housing loans are still necessary, mainly because such regulations have contributed partly to the positive development where more new property projects have begun to offer other housing types rather than focusing on luxury homes.",
        "In discussing about domestic price trends, several board directors and supervisors gave their opinions regarding current inflation, inflation outlook, and inflation expectations.",
        "One board director explained that it was the seasonal factor that pushed the February CPI to a 13-month high, as this year’s Lunar New Year holidays fell in February; however, the average CPI annual growth rate for the first two months of the year and the median of 2018 CPI forecasts by major institutions were both moderate.",
        "One board supervisor added that the CPI spike in February was also attributable to the deferred impact of last year’s cigarette tax hike, and the same price measure would be significantly lower by excluding the seasonal factor and the tax effect.",
        "Another board director stated that current inflation was mild; in the coming months, oil prices and electricity rates might turn higher but the increase will be within a manageable range.",
        "One board director noted that a recent rush for household paper products warranted attention as this might be an indication of public expectations of price rises.",
        "Another board director pointed out that, based on a newly-released survey by a domestic institution, inflation expectations did increase but not to a great extent, which suggested inflation expectations remained well-anchored.",
        "In addition, surveys on inflation expectations in several other countries show that consumers seem inclined to interpret higher prices in their recent purchases as price rises on a full scale; as a result, inflation expectation could easily exceed the projected or actual level by more than one percentage point.",
        "While discussing the interest rate decision, many board directors said that they have taken stock of domestic inflation outlook, economic growth, and the real interest rate and noted that current and expected inflation were both mild, the output gap was still negative, and uncertainties continued to weigh on economic prospects at home and abroad.",
        "Accordingly, they shared the view that it would be appropriate to keep policy rates unchanged.",
        "In particular, one board director pointed out that, while the real interest rate turned negative as opposed to the positive value when the board convened last time, this measure was just one of the elements for the Bank’s monetary policy deliberation.",
        "The primary objectives of the Bank’s operations have long been price and financial stability while fostering economic growth within the scope of these objectives.",
        "Since the increase in current inflation was small and acceptable, a policy rate hold would be in order.",
        "One other board director also agreed, citing that the domestic output gap was still negative, and, despite price rises, the average CPI annual growth rate for the first two months of the year was below 2%.",
        "However, the Bank should pay close attention to price changes and give careful consideration about policy rate adjustment should inflation rise above 2% in the coming months.",
        "One board director contended that, aside from inflation and the unemployment rate, exchange rate movements also play a key role in monetary policy-making.",
        "First, the inflation rate remained below 2%.",
        "Second, while the unemployment rate has dropped to a recent low, the common phenomenon of low wages suggested that slack remained in the labor market.",
        "Third, many companies are sensitive to exchange rate movements as Taiwan is an export-oriented economy.",
        "With the NT dollar already strengthening against the US dollar, a policy rate hike could cause the NT dollar to appreciate further and disturb corporate investment strategies, which would contradict the government’s efforts in promoting domestic investment.",
        "Based on the consideration that policy rate decisions should not induce excess volatility in the foreign exchange market and a surge in capital inflows, a policy rate hold would be warranted.",
        "Another board director also expressed support for a rate hold.",
        "At present, the government is reinforcing its efforts to promote investment in Taiwan, with an aim to industry restructuring through greater investment in external and internal demand-oriented sectors.",
        "Against this backdrop, stable monetary policy will provide some predictability for firms and investors in their investment decisions and thus galvanize domestic investment, which justifies keeping the policy rates unchanged for the time being.",
        "One board director stated that maintaining the current policy rate levels would be appropriate, and that policy rate adjustments generally serve two purposes.",
        "In addition to the announcement effect, policy rates are often fine-tuned instead of sharply changed, and there tends to be a transmission lag.",
        "Therefore, policy rate changes, once initiated, could come in several small increments so as to achieve the intended effect.",
        "In this view, present domestic and international economic situations warrant a rate hold, with future adjustments dependent on the overall economic and financial developments.",
        "Furthermore, several board directors also approved of keeping rates steady, taking into account the trajectory of monetary policies in major economies.",
        "One board director noted that neighboring Asian economies, rivals and partners alike, have held off policy rate adjustments in recent months, and Taiwan, facing a similar background, had little reason to break ranks and hike rates.",
        "Another board director pointed out that the recent US rate hike will be followed by further gradual increases, and the euro area and Japan will also raise rates albeit at a slower pace; given the current economic and financial conditions, it will serve Taiwan well to stay put.",
        "Nevertheless, the zero interest rate policy of major advanced economies since the 2008 global financial crisis could have unhealthy influences on the economy in general.",
        "Interest rates, in the long term, should allow market forces to play out, and policymakers shall be prepared that interest rate changes would eventually set in for the market mechanism to function.",
        "Based on the assessment of domestic and international economic and financial conditions and prospects, the board directors all expressed approval of keeping policy rates unchanged.",
        "Monetary Policy Decision: The board directors reached a unanimous vote to keep the discount rate, the rate on accommodations with collateral, and the rate on accommodations without collateral unchanged at 1.375%, 1.75%, and 3.625%, respectively.",
        "Since the Board met in late December last year, advanced and emerging market economies have posted solid expansion, which may lead global economic growth to strengthen further in 2018.",
        "Among major economies, growth in the US economy is expected to accelerate, the euro area continues to exhibit robust growth, while Japan and China are likely to expand at a slower pace.",
        "Amid the continued global economic pickup, raw material prices may register an uptrend, and therefore inflation in major economies is expected to move up gradually.",
        "Looking ahead, the progress of monetary policy normalization implemented by central banks in major economies, US economic and trade policies, which could cause trade protectionism to spread on a global scale, and heightened volatility of financial asset prices may have an impact on global financial stability and economic outlook.",
        "For the year to date, exports have risen moderately, while capital equipment imports have recorded a smaller decrease.",
        "Consumer confidence has been robust, and the domestic economy has continued to grow.",
        "Labor market conditions were stable, with employment steadily increasing and the unemployment rate declining further.",
        "Growth momentum in exports may slightly weaken this year owing to the base effect.",
        "Nevertheless, the Forward-Looking Infrastructure Development Program rolled out by the government may shore up private investment, while mild wage increases are likely to boost private consumption, which will combine to bolster domestic demand as a major driving force for economic growth.",
        "The CBC forecasts Taiwan's economy to advance at an annual rate of 2.58%, slightly slower than the 2.86% of the year before.",
        "For the first two months of the year, the average annual CPI growth rate was 1.54%, mainly driven by higher vegetable and cigarette prices.",
        "Core inflation (excluding vegetables, fruit, and energy items) recorded an average annual growth rate of 1.61%, indicating a moderate price uptrend.",
        "As imported raw material prices such as crude oil are expected to rise this year and the hikes in minimum wage and public sector employee pay may spur wage increases for workers in the private sector, domestic prices are likely to go up.",
        "However, with the output gap remaining negative, demand-pull inflationary pressures are subdued, and the inflation outlook is stable.",
        "The CBC projects CPI and core CPI to grow at a pace of 1.27% and 1.26% year on year in 2018 (see Appendix 1).",
        "Against a backdrop of continued economic growth and stable inflation, the CBC has continued to manage market liquidity through open market operations and bank reserves have stood at an appropriate level.",
        "For the first two months of the year, bank loans and investments and the monetary aggregate M2 posted average annual growth rates of 4.45% and 3.60%, respectively, deemed sufficient to support economic activity.",
        "In recent months, market liquidity has remained ample and market interest rates have held steady.",
        "The NT dollar has strengthened against the US dollar, but the real effective exchange rate (REER) index of the NT dollar trended down as major currencies appreciated more markedly against the US dollar.",
        "Overall, the financial condition index has generally reflected easy financial conditions.",
        "In sum, both current inflationary pressures and future inflation expectations are mild, and Taiwan's real interest rate stands at an appropriate level among major economies (see Appendix 2).",
        "In addition, global economic outlook still faces uncertainties, while the domestic growth momentum could soften modestly from the previous year and the actual output remains below potential.",
        "Based on the above assessment, the Board judged that a policy rate hold will help safeguard price and financial stability and foster economic growth.",
        "The Board reached the following decision unanimously at the Meeting today:\nThe discount rate, the rate on accommodations with collateral, and the rate on accommodations without collateral are kept unchanged at 1.375%, 1.75%, and 3.625%, respectively.",
        "The CBC will continue to watch the latest developments in domestic economic and financial conditions including actual and expected inflation and the output gap.",
        "We will closely monitor the progress of policy normalization by major central banks, monetary policy changes in emerging market economies, and risks likely induced by heightened financial market turmoil around the world.",
        "The CBC will timely undertake appropriate monetary policy actions as warranted by these developments in order to fulfill the central bank's statutory mandate.",
        "The CBC has adopted consistent exchange rate policy aimed at dynamic stability.",
        "In principle, the NT dollar exchange rate is determined by market forces.",
        "If irregular factors (such as massive inflows or outflows of short-term capital) lead to excess volatility and disorderly movements in the NT dollar exchange rate with adverse implications for economic and financial stability, the CBC will step in to maintain an orderly market."

    "2016": [
        "As manufacturing activity and trade gathered pace, the global economy is expected to rebound in 2017 after dipping to a low in the previous year and will perform slightly better in the second half of the year than the first half.",
        "Most economies post brighter prospects, with solid growth in the US, Japan, and the euro area, as well as Asian economies largely registering higher growth than 2016.",
        "However, China could experience a modest slowdown.",
        "The economic recovery may bring forth mild inflation in advanced economies this year, while high inflation in emerging market economies is likely to ease owing to currency appreciation and policy actions in some countries.",
        "International stock markets were up and the VIX index held flat, whereas the global Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) index rose higher.",
        "Meanwhile, the Fed’s plan to begin trimming its balance sheet in the second half year may lead to financial strains around the world, a destabilizing force to global financial markets.",
        "Rising trade protectionism could dampen the global trade recovery.",
        "Together with the path of Brexit negotiations increasingly unclear and geopolitical risk mounting, the global economic outlook still faces many uncertainties.",
        "Labor market conditions have continued to improve since the March Board Meeting; thanks to the domestic economic pickup, the number of employed persons increased, the unemployment rate dropped further, and average monthly wages increased moderately.",
        "Despite the steady pace of economic expansion, growth in exports and capital equipment imports both slowed, while retail sales also posted limited growth.",
        "The overall monitoring indicator flashed a “yellow-blue” (“transitional” between “stable” and “sluggish”) signal.",
        "Considering these and a higher base effect in the second half of the year, the pace of the economic recovery may moderate slightly.",
        "Major forecasting institutions at home and abroad project Taiwan’s economy to advance between 2.04% and 2.20%.",
        "The Bank forecasts this year’s GDP growth rate to be 2.13%, higher than last year’s 1.48%.",
        "In terms of external demand, a steadily recovering international economy further shored up demand for semiconductors and Taiwan’s exports of electronic parts and components increased.",
        "Combined with a lower base effect, the annual export growth rate was 12.5% for the first five months of the year, with positive growth registered in exports to all major destination economies.",
        "The outlook for the second half of the year points to steady growth in semiconductor demand supported by upward revision in forecasts for global economic and trade growth.",
        "Meanwhile, active business investment in the emerging applications related to the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud services, among others, are also likely to fuel export growth.",
        "However, a slowing Chinese economy, lingering world trade protectionism and a higher base effect may combine to restrict export momentum in the second half of the year.",
        "For the year as a whole, though, exports are expected to register steady growth.",
        "In terms of domestic demand, consumer spending is expected to gain strength as production activity expanded steadily, corporate demand for labor increased, and cash dividends to stockholders reached a five-year high.",
        "However, because of limited real wage growth and low consumer confidence, the second half of the year will see lower growth momentum for private spending than the first half.",
        "Private investment is expected to be spurred by continued investment in machinery equipment and R&D among semiconductor manufacturers and the affiliated participants along the supply chain, as well as by firmer demand for commercial real estate.",
        "On the other hand, scores of leading indicators and coincident indicators continued on a downtrend, capital equipment import growth slowed in recent months, and investment in machinery equipment in the second half of the year faces a higher base effect.",
        "These factors combine to point to a more cautious outlook for private investment for the next half of the year.",
        "Domestic market interest rates have kept steady, while the real interest rate was negative, similar to many other economies.",
        "Assessed against economic conditions, some of those economies enjoy higher GDP growth with a lower real interest rate when compared with Taiwan.",
        "This suggests the level of our real interest rate is appropriate and not too low.",
        "In May, the M2 annual growth rate climbed to 4.07% as net foreign capital inflows rose.",
        "For the first five months of the year, the M2 annual growth rate averaged 3.72%, staying within the target range (2.5% - 6.5%) and higher than the sum of the 2017 projected GDP and CPI annual growth rates.",
        "Bank loans and investments exhibited slower annual growth at a pace of 5.06% in May, mainly because banks pared down investment positions as they turned in the income tax revenue collected over to the government treasury.",
        "For the first five months of the year, the average annual growth rate of bank loans and investments was 4.65%.",
        "On balance, market liquidity conditions are judged as sufficient in meeting the need of economic activity.",
        "Since the beginning of the year, market liquidity has been ample, the overnight call loan rate has stayed steady, and the 10-year government bond yield has moved within a narrow range.",
        "Meanwhile, foreign capital showed a net inflow, the NT dollar appreciated, and Taiwan’s stock markets rallied.",
        "Steady interest rates and foreign buying of domestic stock shares have contributed to the easy conditions in money market and stock markets, which partially offset the tightening effect of a stronger currency.",
        "The overall Financial Conditions Index (FCI) indicated tighter conditions in June compared to the end of the previous year.",
        "Looking ahead, the domestic economic pickup would help to support demand for funds; however, as the Federal Reserve may carry on with rate hikes and uncertainties may still threaten to affect the domestic economy, international capital flows will be a key factor behind M2 growth trends in the coming months.",
        "Meanwhile, bank loans and investments are likely to grow steadily as the domestic recovery and mild growth in fixed investment drive a stable demand for funds.",
        "In 2017 so far, as the NT dollar appreciation helped mitigate imported inflationary pressures and food prices stayed low, consumer prices have risen mildly.",
        "For the first five months of the year, the average CPI annual growth rate was 0.60%, mainly because a slump in vegetable prices mostly offset the increases in fuel and fruit prices.",
        "The average core CPI annual growth rate (excluding fruit, vegetables, and energy prices) for the same period was 0.97%.",
        "The OPEC announced an extended production freeze at the end of May instead of further output cuts as expected by the market, while the US continued to increase production and crude stockpiles remained high.",
        "Consequently, oil prices moved downwards.",
        "The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects that by the end of 2018 crude oil supply will slightly exceed its demand, putting a lid on oil prices.",
        "The forecasts made by major institutions at home and abroad suggest a mild inflation outlook for Taiwan in 2017.",
        "The median of domestic institutions’ forecasts is 1.20%, and the median of international institutions’ forecasts is 1.30%.",
        "The Bank forecasts this year’s CPI annual growth rate to be 1.07% and core CPI 1.11%.",
        "Compared to March projections, the inflation outlook remains stable.",
        "In part, mild domestic inflation also reflects a negative output gap.",
        "As demand softened, a widening negative output gap helped to contain inflationary pressures.",
        "The key factors behind domestic price trends include the following.",
        "Upward pressures on prices may come from (1) price increases for services such as buses and restaurants owing to higher labor costs under the five-day workweek system, (2) higher cigarette prices as a result of the June 12 hike of the cigarette tax by NT$20 per pack, and (3) an expected upsurge in vegetable prices owing to torrential rain in June.",
        "Meanwhile, the negative output gap and insufficient aggregate demand might create downward pressures on prices.",
        "Global economy is set for a steady recovery, but uncertainties remain.",
        "As manufacturing activity and trade gradually picked up, global economic growth is expected to rebound from the low level of last year.",
        "Looking ahead, prospects are brighter for most economies.",
        "Nevertheless, the global economy is still clouded by uncertainties.",
        "In contrast to monetary easing in the euro area and Japan, the US Fed is gradually moving towards policy normalization, which might amplify financial market turbulence around the world.",
        "Global economic and trade policy uncertainties, progress of Brexit negotiations, and geopolitical risks could also hinder the global recovery.",
        "Taiwan’s growth momentum might slightly soften in the next half of the year; current inflationary pressures and expected inflation are both mild.",
        "Slower growth in exports and capital equipment imports in recent months, as well as limited growth in retail sales, may put a drag on economic growth.",
        "For the first five months of this year, the price increase was mild.",
        "In terms of the inflation outlook for the second half of the year, the recent cigarette tax hike may exert upward pressures on prices.",
        "However, global inflation expectations are moderate, international oil prices stay low; domestically, demand growth is still slow and the output gap continues to be negative.",
        "On balance, the inflation outlook for this year remains stable.",
        "Taiwan’s real interest rate in relation to economic growth stands at an appropriate level compared to major economies.",
        "Among a selected group of economies, many register negative real interest rates.",
        "Compared to Taiwan, some of them have higher economic growth but lower real interest rates.",
        "This may indicate that Taiwan’s real interest rate stands broadly appropriate compared with the economies in the group.",
        "All Board members approved of keeping policy rates unchanged.",
        "The discussions are summarized as follows.",
        "Regarding the international economic situation, one Board Director expressed the view that though a global economic pickup is expected for this year, the longer-term growth trend is still weak.",
        "With the support of robust financial markets in recent years and a cyclical recovery in global manufacturing activity and trade since the second half of 2016, growth momentum for global economy will strengthen and world trade volume is expected to register faster growth too.",
        "With regard to advanced economies, the US expansionary fiscal stimulus is likely to drive up global economic growth, while the outlook for Europe and Japan seems brighter on the back of growth in global manufacturing sectors and world trade.",
        "With respect to emerging market economies, growth in this group is likely to gain stronger momentum as a rebound of commodity prices from early 2016’s low has brought forth a gradual upturn in commodity exporters while commodity importers including China have seen signs of improvement.",
        "The same Board Director also pointed out that although international forecasting institutions made similar projections for a global economic pickup, some of them recently revised down the forecasts for global GDP and trade growth for the coming years.",
        "The main rationales of the downward revision included (1) both supply-side and demand-side factors resulting in the low global growth trend have not receded, and (2) long-term structural factors will require more time to resolve.",
        "The global economy also faces several risks, including: (a) Decreases in trade and cross-border investment as a result of trade protectionism could cause global economic growth to falter; (b) a steeper-than-expected path of rate hikes in major economies could bring forth a sharper tightening of global financial conditions, carrying adverse implications for economies with vulnerabilities, and (c) re-emergence of financial deregulation in the world and financial tensions in some emerging market economies could hamper global financial stability.",
        "With regard to domestic economic conditions, one Board Director expressed views on the strength of the domestic recovery.",
        "In the second half of 2016, as a buoyant semiconductor market and a stabilizing global economy helped drive a surge in export growth, and increases in capital outlay by semiconductor firms resulted in robust growth in private investment, Taiwan’s economy expanded faster by 2.46% from the former half year’s 0.46%.",
        "For this year as a whole, the domestic economy is likely to grow faster than last year at a pace of 2.05%, according to the DGBAS’ forecast.",
        "Although the economy has gradually regained strength from the trough in 2015, Taiwan could still face a long-term trend of lower growth encumbered by still weak momentum for a global recovery.",
        "Recently, some international forecasting institutions gave slightly downward revision to Taiwan’s GDP growth projections for the period between 2017 and 2020.",
        "In terms of domestic financial conditions, one Board Director discussed Taiwan’s M2 and credit growth.",
        "This Director stated that the M2 annual growth rate averaged 3.72% for the first five months of the year, lower than the median value (4.5%) of the 2017 M2 growth target range (2.5% - 6.5%).",
        "The main reason was that insurance companies bought more foreign currency-denominated bonds with the funds shifted into insurance policies from bank deposits.",
        "However, the 3.72% M2 growth was still higher than the sum of the projected GDP and CPI annual growth rates, which indicate sufficient liquidity to support economic activity.",
        "Despite some moderation in bank loans and investments in recent months, the annual growth rate remained on an upward path, suggesting no anomaly regarding M2 and credit growth.",
        "Board Directors expressed their opinions on the impact of exchange rate and stock price movements on financial conditions.",
        "One Board Director noted that both the NT dollar exchange rate vis-à-vis the US dollar and the NTD NEER (nominal effective exchange rate) index showed that the NT dollar has appreciated more than the Japanese yen, the Korean won, the renminbi, the Singapore dollar, and the euro.",
        "As of June, the overall financial conditions have tightened because of NTD appreciation since the beginning of the year.",
        "Another Board Director pointed out that, although rising stock prices helped to mitigate a tightening in financial conditions, the wealth effect of stock rallies mainly benefited foreign investors, who collectively hold about 40% of the shares listed on Taiwan’s stock markets.",
        "In particular, a large proportion of IT stocks, one of the most actively traded groups, are held by foreign investors, depriving local investors of the opportunity to fully enjoy the rewards of a stock rally while foreign investors garner most of the cash dividends.",
        "In this view, the influence of foreign investors’ activity in stock markets should also be considered when analyzing financial conditions.",
        "In addition, one Board Director noted there seem to be an increasingly significant correlation between the actions of foreign investors and movements in Taiwan’s foreign exchange and stock markets.",
        "This Director pointed out that co-movements between stock prices and exchange rates could create risks.",
        "Whether a high correlation of the two types of markets implies a rising risk is something worth exploring.",
        "There is also the question of whether foreign capital inflows are actually attracted by the stock market boom or meant for other purposes.",
        "Another Board Director concurred that frequent inflows and outflows of foreign capital will certainly pose a higher risk.",
        "Several Board Directors discussed the US Fed’s rate hike, and the movements and spread of the US and Taiwan’s bond yields.",
        "One Board Director shared the observation that the US bond yields declined in spite of the Fed’s continued policy rate hikes, showing the Fed’s rate decisions are not the only force behind bond yields.",
        "Another Board Director noted that investors still find the US treasuries attractive because Japan’s 10-year bond yield was close to zero and the yields on German and French short-term (under 5 years) bonds slipped into negative territory, but the US treasuries, with a large market and among the most liquid assets, still exhibited positive yields across all maturities.",
        "Many Board Directors shared similar views.",
        "One Board Director said that although the risk was elevated with the US being the source, investors have generally considered US Treasuries to bear the lowest risk and thus increased their holdings.",
        "As a result, the US bond yields did not rise in response to the US rate hikes but dropped instead.",
        "Such trends would therefore narrow the spread between Taiwan’s and US longer-term bills.",
        "It is important to heed how this would affect international capital movements.",
        "In sum, the Board Directors expressed their views in favor of the monetary policy proposition.",
        "Several Directors noted that, in the second half of the year, the strength in Taiwan’s economic recovery may be dampened by limited growth in exports and slower upturns in private consumption and private investment.",
        "Meanwhile, the economic growth is forecast to run below potential.",
        "Considering a sustained increase in exports, it would be reasonable to keep the policy rates at their current levels.",
        "Several Board Directors also pointed out that monetary policy decisions should take into account both current inflationary pressures and the future inflation outlook.",
        "At present, domestic prices were relatively moderate and inflation expectations were mild, while a negative output gap remained with real output below potential output.",
        "The circumstances do not necessarily warrant monetary tightening.",
        "One Board Director stated that Taiwan’s real interest rate, though negative, was still higher than those of the US, Singapore, South Korea, and Hong Kong, while Taiwan’s 2017 GDP growth projections by forecasting institutions were broadly lower than these economies.",
        "A comparison regarding Taiwan’s real interest rate and GDP growth rate suggest that Taiwan did not post a relatively low real interest rate, while our monetary policy stance was not particularly loose and even tighter than some economies.",
        "This indicated there was no urgent need for a rate hike.",
        "With respect to monetary policy outlook, one Board Director further expressed the approval of maintaining current policy rate levels.",
        "Meanwhile, the Fed carried on with rate hikes, there remained international economic uncertainties, and some central banks made prudent decisions to hold rates unchanged, including Taiwan’s major trading partners such as China, Japan, and the euro area, and a primary export rival South Korea.",
        "Against this backdrop, the Bank should carefully examine future developments and take appropriate actions in response as warranted.",
        "Based on the assessment of domestic and international economic and financial conditions and prospects, the Board Directors expressed approval of keeping policy rates unchanged.",
        "Board members reached a unanimous vote to keep the discount rate, the rate on accommodations with collateral, and the rate on accommodations without collateral unchanged at 1.375%, 1.75%, and 3.625%, respectively.",
        "Since the beginning of the year, world trade has gradually picked up and the international economic recovery has gained a more solid footing.",
        "The near-term outlook points to moderate US economic expansion, a sustained eurozone recovery, and modest acceleration in Japan.",
        "Growth in emerging market economies is likely to gather pace, while the Chinese economy might experience a mild slowdown.",
        "In the context of the economic uptick and subdued inflation, central banks in the euro area and Japan both maintained monetary easing policies.",
        "The US Fed, however, continued on the path toward gradual normalization, which could heighten financial market volatility.",
        "The global economic outlook also faces other causes for concern, including uncertainties associated with international economic and trade policies, the progress of Brexit negotiations, and geopolitical risks.",

        "The Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting, and Statistics (DGBAS) forecasts that, in the second half of the year, the economy will advance at 1.76%, slower than the first half year's 2.37% owing to a higher base effect.",
        "For the year as a whole, the economic growth projection is 2.05%.",
