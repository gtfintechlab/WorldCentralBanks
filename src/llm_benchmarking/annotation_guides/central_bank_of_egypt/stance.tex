    \textbf{Dovish}: The inflation rate has consistently been decreasing suggesting that the MPC will decrease interest rates. 
    \item ``The slight increase in the remittances of the Egyptians working abroad by 1.6 percent to register US \$ 31.9 billion.''\\
    \textbf{Hawkish}: Increase in remittance payments means larger money supply in Egypt and more economic activity, increase the money supply in the market. Therefore, MPC would increase interest rates. 
    \item ``Globally, the expansion of economic activity continued to weaken, financial conditions eased, and trade tensions continued to weigh on the outlook.''\\
    \textbf{Neutral}: Both hawkish and dovish sentiment are expressed. Weakened economic growth and trade tensions indicates decreasing interest rates but easing financial conditions suggests that may not be necessary.
