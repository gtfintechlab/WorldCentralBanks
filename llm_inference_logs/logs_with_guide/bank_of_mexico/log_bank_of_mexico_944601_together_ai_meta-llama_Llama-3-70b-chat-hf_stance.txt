A weaker peso may be seen as dovish, especially when Banco de México is attempting to support exports by making Mexican goods cheaper in foreign markets. A stronger peso helps control inflation by making imports cheaper, but it can hurt export competitiveness.\n\n    \\item \\textit{Trade Activity:}  \n    Sentences pertaining to the import/export ratio—an increase in one or decrease of another. Banco de México favors policies that stimulate exports, especially given Mexico’s strong manufacturing sector and trade agreements (such as USMCA). A focus on export growth could support job creation and help maintain balance in current account deficits.\n\n    \\item \\textit{Labor:}  \n    Sentences mentioning statistics about the increase or decrease in productivity. If there are concerns about declining productivity—especially in key industries in Mexico like oil, manufacturing, or agriculture—Banco de México might lean hawkish, signaling the need to cool off the economy to address inefficiencies.\n\n    \\item \\textit{Key Words:}  \n    Sentences that have keywords that make a clear, strong indication towards classifications.\n\n    % \\item \\textbf{Interest Rates:}  \n    % Sentences mentioning a change in interest rates or stating that there will be no change. A hawkish stance would likely aim at curbing inflation, which has been a persistent challenge for Mexico. In this case, higher interest rates may be designed to stabilize the peso or protect purchasing power.\n\n    \\item \\textit{Economic Growth:}  \n    Sentences conveying the performance in economic growth the bank wishes to see in the near future. Given Mexico’s economic structure, fostering growth in sectors like manufacturing, tourism, and remittances can be seen as a dovish move aimed at reducing poverty and unemployment.\n\n    % \\item \\textbf{Fiscal Spending:}  \n    % Sentences mentioning how the government is changing its spending policies. Banco de México may support higher government spending on social programs, particularly during economic downturns or times of political instability. This would reflect a dovish stance aimed at alleviating inequality or stimulating domestic demand.\n\n    \\item \\textit{Market Sentiment:}  \n    Sentences mentioning what the outlook is for the market and how investors are acting.\n\n    \\item \\textit{Energy/House Prices:}  \n    Sentences that mention anything about housing price levels and energy price levels. Given Mexico’s reliance on oil and gas revenues, a dovish outlook might stem from efforts to lower energy prices domestically, encouraging consumption and reducing inflationary pressure on households.\n\n    % \\item \\textbf{Outlook:}  \n    % This focuses on whether a sentiment is forward-looking (future) or not (past or present). This category is relatively self-explanatory and can usually be determined by the verb tense of the sentence.\n\n    % \\item \\textbf{Certainty:}  \n    % This focuses on whether the sentiment is sure something will happen or has happened.

A weaker peso may be seen as dovish, especially when Banco de México is attempting to support exports by making Mexican goods cheaper in foreign markets. A stronger peso helps control inflation by making imports cheaper, but it can hurt export competitiveness.\n\n    \\item \\textit{Trade Activity:}  \n    Sentences pertaining to the import/export ratio—an increase in one or decrease of another.

A focus on export growth could support job creation and help maintain balance in current account deficits.\n\n    \\item \\textit{Labor:}  \n    Sentences mentioning statistics about the increase or decrease in productivity.

A stronger peso helps control inflation by making imports cheaper, but it can hurt export competitiveness.\n\n    \\item \\textit{Trade Activity:}  \n    Sentences pertaining to the import/export ratio—an increase in one or decrease of another.
