affecting overall economic stability.\n    \\item \\textit{GDP:} Israel’s GDP growth has been influenced by the central bank’s monetary policies, balancing inflation control with efforts to sustain economic expansion.\n    \\item \\textit{Unemployment Rate:} The unemployment rate has shifted due to monetary policy measures aimed at either job creation or inflation containment, affecting labor market dynamics.\n    \\item \\textit{Job Vacancy Rate:} Changes in the job vacancy rate indicate shifts in labor demand, reflecting the impact of central bank policies on hiring trends and wage pressures.\n    \\item \\textit{NIS to Euro (or Dollar):} The exchange rate of the Israeli shekel against the Euro and the U.S. dollar has fluctuated, influencing import costs, export competitiveness, and inflation levels.\n    \\item \\textit{Inflation:} The Bank of Israel has implemented monetary policies to stabilize inflation, ensuring that price levels remain within the target range for economic stability.\n    \\item \\textit{Housing Market:} Interest rate adjustments have directly affected mortgage rates, impacting housing affordability and real estate market activity.\n    \\item

economic expansion.\n    \\item \\textit{Unemployment Rate:} The unemployment rate has shifted due to monetary policy measures aimed at either job creation or inflation containment, affecting labor market dynamics.\n    \\item \\textit{Job Vacancy Rate:} Changes in the job vacancy rate indicate shifts in labor demand, reflecting the impact of central bank policies on hiring trends and wage pressures.\n    \\item \\textit{NIS to Euro (or Dollar):} The exchange rate of the Israeli shekel against the Euro and the U.S. dollar has fluctuated, influencing import costs, export competitiveness, and inflation levels.\n    \\item \\textit{Inflation:} The Bank of Israel has implemented monetary policies to stabilize inflation, ensuring that price levels remain within the target range for economic stability.\n    \\item \\textit{Housing Market:} Interest rate adjustments have directly affected mortgage rates, impacting housing affordability and real estate market activity.\n    \\item

affecting overall economic stability.\n    \\item \\textit{GDP:} Israel’s GDP growth has been influenced by the central bank’s monetary policies, balancing inflation control with efforts to sustain economic expansion.\n    \\item \\textit{Unemployment Rate:} The unemployment rate has shifted due to monetary policy measures aimed at either job creation or inflation containment, affecting labor market dynamics.\n    \\item \\textit{Job Vacancy Rate:} Changes in the job vacancy rate indicate shifts in labor demand, reflecting the impact of central bank policies on hiring trends and wage pressures.\n    \\item \\textit{NIS to Euro (or Dollar):} The exchange rate of the Israeli shekel against the Euro and the U.S. dollar has fluctuated, influencing import costs, export competitiveness, and inflation levels.\n    \\item \\textit{Inflation:} The Bank of Israel has implemented monetary policies to stabilize inflation, ensuring that price levels remain within the target range for economic stability.\n    \\item \\textit{Housing Market:} Interest rate adjustments have directly affected mortgage rates, impacting housing affordability and real estate market activity.\n    \\item
