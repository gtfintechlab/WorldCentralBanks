The Bank of Israel has adjusted its benchmark interest rate, influencing the cost of borrowing and impacting economic activity by either stimulating or cooling down demand.\n    \\item \\textit{Capital Market Inflation Rate:} Inflation in Israel's financial markets has been reflected in fluctuations in asset prices, with stock and bond markets responding to macroeconomic conditions and central bank policies.\n    \\item \\textit{Total Assets:} The Bank of Israel's balance sheet has expanded as foreign reserves increased, injecting liquidity into the financial system and affecting overall economic stability.\n    \\item \\textit{GDP:} Israel’s GDP growth has been influenced by the central bank’s monetary policies, balancing inflation control with efforts to sustain economic expansion.\n    \\item \\textit{Unemployment Rate:} The unemployment rate has shifted due to monetary policy measures aimed at either job creation or inflation containment, affecting labor market dynamics.\n    \\item \\textit{Job Vacancy Rate:} Changes in the job vacancy rate indicate shifts in labor demand, reflecting the impact of central bank policies on hiring trends and wage pressures.\n    \\item \\textit{NIS to Euro (or Dollar):} The exchange rate of the Israeli shekel against the Euro and the U.S. dollar has fluctuated, influencing import costs, export competitiveness, and inflation levels.\n    \\item \\textit{Inflation:} The Bank of Israel has implemented monetary policies to stabilize inflation, ensuring that price levels remain within the target range for economic stability.\n    \\item \\textit{Housing Market:} Interest rate adjustments have directly affected mortgage rates, impacting housing affordability and real estate market activity.\n    \\item

economic expansion.\n    \\item \\textit{Unemployment Rate:} The unemployment rate has shifted due to monetary policy measures aimed at either job creation or inflation containment, affecting labor market dynamics.\n    \\item \\textit{Job Vacancy Rate:} Changes in the job vacancy rate indicate shifts in labor demand, reflecting the impact of central bank policies on hiring trends and wage pressures.\n    \\item \\textit{NIS to Euro (or Dollar):} The exchange rate of the Israeli shekel against the Euro and the U.S. dollar has fluctuated, influencing import costs, export competitiveness, and inflation levels.\n    \\item \\textit{Inflation:} The Bank of Israel has implemented monetary policies to stabilize inflation, ensuring that price levels remain within the target range for

The Bank of Israel has adjusted its benchmark interest rate, influencing the cost of borrowing and impacting economic activity by either stimulating or cooling down demand.\n    \\item \\textit{Capital Market Inflation Rate:} Inflation in Israel's financial markets has been reflected in fluctuations in asset prices, with stock and bond markets responding to macroeconomic conditions and central bank policies.\n    \\item \\textit{Total Assets:} The Bank of Israel's balance sheet has expanded as foreign reserves increased, injecting liquidity into the financial system and affecting overall economic stability.\n    \\item \\textit{GDP:} Israel’s GDP growth has been influenced by the central bank’s monetary policies, balancing inflation control with efforts to sustain economic expansion.\n    \\item \\textit{Unemployment Rate:} The unemployment rate has shifted due to monetary policy measures aimed at either job creation or inflation containment, affecting labor market dynamics.\n    \\item \\textit{Job Vacancy Rate:} Changes in the job vacancy rate indicate shifts in labor demand, reflecting the impact of central bank policies on hiring trends and wage pressures.\n    \\item \\textit{NIS to Euro (or Dollar):} The exchange rate of the Israeli shekel against the Euro and the U.S. dollar has fluctuated, influencing import costs, export competitiveness, and inflation levels.\n    \\item \\textit{Inflation:} The Bank of Israel has implemented monetary policies to stabilize inflation, ensuring that price levels remain within the target range for economic stability.\n    \\item \\textit{Housing Market:} Interest rate adjustments have directly affected mortgage rates, impacting housing affordability and real estate market activity.\n    \\item
