A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

2025-04-14 14:20:10,824 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence only mentions past data and does not refer to future projections or expectations."
}
```

This sentence appears to be discussing historical data, specifically percent increases in previous months and a specific expansion in November 2003, without mentioning any future outlook or projections, which is why it is classified as "not forward looking".
2025-04-14 14:20:10,824 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence refers to past events and does not express a prediction or projection about future monetary policy actions or economic conditions."
}
```

This sentence is not forward looking because it discusses past events, specifically the appreciation of the currency since November 2001, and does not provide any information about future expectations or projections.
2025-04-14 14:20:10,824 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a past decision made by the LTFRB on a specific date, which indicates it is describing a historical event rather than making a prediction or statement about future actions."
}
```

This sentence does not relate to the Central Bank of the Philippines' monetary policy meeting, but based on its content, it can be classified as not forward looking since it discusses a past event.

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses potential future actions ('further monetary easing') and their possible impact, indicating a forward-looking perspective."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "forward looking" because it mentions potential future actions ("further monetary easing") and their possible impact on the foreign exchange market, indicating that the sentence is discussing possibilities or prospects that may unfold in the future.
2025-04-14 14:20:14,491 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses past events and reactions to anticipated future actions, but does not express a future prediction or projection related to the Central Bank of the Philippines' monetary policy."
}
```

Note that the sentence mentions a possible future event (the tapering of the US Fed's QE program), but it is reporting on how this anticipation affected bond spreads in the past (in November). The focus is on historical events rather than a forward-looking statement about the Central Bank of the Philippines' monetary policy.

However, I noticed that the input sentence seems unrelated to the Central Bank of the Philippines' monetary policy meeting. If that's not relevant to the task, please let me know and I'll focus on the classification task only. 

Also, I assume "addition" is a typo and it should be "2024" or another
