A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence discusses the approval of the highlights of the discussions from a previous Monetary Board meeting, held on a specific date in the past (18 November 2004), during a subsequent meeting on another date in the past (16 December 2004). It lists the individuals involved in the discussions.

Given this information, the sentence is describing past events without indicating any future actions, decisions, or outlooks regarding the monetary policy.

Therefore, the classification should be based on whether the sentence looks forward to future events or remains focused on past occurrences.

The sentence is: "these drivers of growth offset the negative contribution from exports."

1. **Understanding the task**: We need to determine if the sentence is "forward looking" or "not forward looking" in the context of the Central Bank of the Philippines' monetary policy meeting. "Forward looking" typically refers to statements that imply or directly discuss future expectations, predictions, or guidance.

2. **Analyzing the sentence**: The sentence discusses the drivers of growth and their relation to exports. It implies a current or past situation by using the verb "offset," which is in
2025-04-14 14:10:11,051 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and context.

The sentence is: "inflationary expectations on one hand and the evolving domestic demand conditions, on the other hand, the monetary board, by a unanimous vote, approved to restore the tiering scheme on banks’ placements with the bsp under the rrp and sda windows."

First, we need to understand what "forward looking" means in the context of monetary policy statements. Forward-looking statements typically provide guidance or indication about future actions, decisions, or the direction of monetary policy.

The given sentence mentions "inflationary expectations" and "evolving domestic demand conditions,"
2025-04-14 14:10:11,051 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and implications.

The sentence is: "nevertheless, current high fiscal deficits, record-low interest rates, large-scale monetary easing, and other government interventions are not sustainable: an expansion of private demand is necessary to drive the global recovery beyond the impact of the various stimuli."

First, we need to understand what "forward looking" means in this context. A statement is considered "forward looking" if it contains information or projections about future events, conditions, or outcomes.

The given sentence discusses the unsustainability of current economic measures and the necessity of an expansion in private demand to drive global recovery
