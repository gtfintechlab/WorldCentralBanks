A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses consideration of options rather than a definitive decision or action, indicating uncertainty about the outcome of the monetary policy meeting."

```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it mentions that the members of the monetary board "considered" various options, which implies a discussion or exploration of possibilities rather than a concrete decision or commitment. This language suggests a lack of certainty about the outcome of the meeting.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains phrases like 'relatively little indication' and 'thus far', which suggest a degree of uncertainty or incompleteness in the information available."

```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it implies that the situation is still evolving and that there is a lack of clear evidence, which is a characteristic of uncertain statements.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a conditional willingness to take future action based on potential market conditions, indicating uncertainty about the future."

This classification is based on the presence of conditional phrases such as "should conditions...continue to point", "could threaten", and "in the future", which introduce uncertainty about the future actions of the monetary board and the potential outcomes of the foreign exchange market.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports specific data and statistics from credible sources, indicating a factual and certain statement."

```

The sentence presents specific numbers and data from sources like CAMPI and the Truck Manufacturers Association, which suggests that the information is factual and certain. There are no words or phrases that indicate uncertainty, such as "may", "could", or "likely".
2025-04-14 14:12:53,550 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the sentence and provide a justification, I need to analyze the given sentence: "information available at the time of the policy meeting."


Given that the sentence does not specify any details that can be verified or quantified and refers to a condition or state ("information available"), it implies a condition that may or may not be subject to change and does not assert a fact that can be labeled as definitely true or false without further context.


Therefore, my classification is:


{
"label": "uncertain",
"justification": "The sentence's truth value depends on the context or perspective, making it uncertain."
}

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it mentions that monetary authorities "continue to face" inflation risks, implying a potential future threat rather than a current or past fact. The use of "continue to face" and "risks" also suggests a degree of unpredictability, contributing to the uncertainty.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses potential risks to inflation using phrases such as 'seen as the main upside risks', indicating a degree of uncertainty."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it uses phrases that suggest potential or possible effects on inflation, rather than stating definite or actual effects. The use of "seen as" and "are seen as" implies that the risks are perceived or anticipated, but not necessarily actual or confirmed.

{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'likely' and 'chances', indicating a degree of uncertainty about future events."

```

This classification is based on the presence of words that express probability or possibility, rather than statements of fact. The use of "will likely", "chances of", and specific date ranges for potential future events (e.g., "during April – June 2024", "by June – August 2024") suggests that the sentence is discussing predictions or forecasts, which are inherently uncertain.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a factual observation about past price trends, stating a clear and specific trend, indicating certainty."

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents a factual observation about the past price trends of domestic petroleum products, without any ambiguous language or expression of doubt. The use of "showed mixed trends" indicates a clear and specific trend that has been observed, which supports the classification as certain.
