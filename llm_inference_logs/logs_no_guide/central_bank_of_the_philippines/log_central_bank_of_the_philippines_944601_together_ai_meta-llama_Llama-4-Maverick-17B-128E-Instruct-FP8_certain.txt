A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "by contrast, food inflation eased but remained elevated given the double-digit inflation for rice."

This sentence reports on a specific economic indicator (food inflation) and its relation to another specific indicator (rice inflation), stating a factual comparison.

To determine if it's certain or uncertain, we need to look for language that indicates doubt, possibility, or prediction versus language that states facts or observations.

The key elements here are:
- "eased" and "remained elevated" are factual observations about the direction and state of food inflation.

2025-04-14 14:22:16,764 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, we need to analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "- latest data generally showed moderate improvements in demand conditions."

Let's break it down:

1. The term "generally" indicates a generalization rather than a definitive statement, suggesting some level of uncertainty or variability in the data.
2. The phrase "moderate improvements" is also somewhat vague, as "moderate" can vary in interpretation.

Given these observations, the sentence does not convey a definitive or absolute statement about the demand conditions. Instead, it suggests a trend or a general observation with some inherent ambiguity.

Therefore, the classification should be:

The sentence is: "transmission charge and other bill components also increased."

Let's break it down:

1. The sentence is stating a fact about an increase in certain components.
2. There's no conditional language (e.g., "may have increased", "could have risen") or speculative tone.
3. The verb "increased" is in a definitive form, indicating a factual statement.

Given these observations, the sentence is making a factual statement without expressing doubt or uncertainty.

Therefore, the classification should be:
