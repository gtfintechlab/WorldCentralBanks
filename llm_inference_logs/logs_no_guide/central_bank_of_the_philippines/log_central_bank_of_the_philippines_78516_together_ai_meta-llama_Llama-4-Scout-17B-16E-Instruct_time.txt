A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence simply states a fact about the past (stabilization of ASEAN manufacturing conditions and improvement in PMI in November) without expressing a future expectation or prediction, which is why I classified it as "not forward looking".

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses the potential effects of a past or current policy action, rather than making a prediction or statement about future policy actions."

This sentence is not forward looking because it analyzes the potential consequences of a policy decision that is being considered "at this time", implying a current or imminent decision, rather than discussing future policy actions or projections.

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses past consideration of monetary policy options, indicating a focus on historical actions rather than future prospects."
}
```

I chose "not forward looking" because the sentence mentions "considered" (past tense), indicating that the discussion about monetary policy options has already occurred, rather than looking ahead to future actions or projections.
2025-04-14 14:13:42,839 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my output:

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses past observations and current effects, rather than making predictions or statements about future events or policy actions."
}
```

I chose "not forward looking" because the sentence focuses on what has been observed so far, using phrases like "thus far", indicating a backward-looking perspective.
2025-04-14 14:13:42,839 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses potential future actions and conditions that may unfold, indicating a forward-looking perspective."
}
```

I chose "forward looking" because the sentence mentions "in the future", "should conditions continue", and "over the policy horizon", which all suggest that the sentence is discussing potential future events and actions.
2025-04-14 14:13:42,839 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my output:

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses the future direction of inflation risks, indicating a forward-looking perspective."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "forward looking" because it mentions the future direction of inflation risks, using phrases like "continues to lean towards the upside", which implies a projection or outlook on future inflation.

Although the sentence mentions "inflation expectations—as measured in forecast surveys for january—were lower compared to the previous month and aligned to the inflation target", the expectations mentioned are about the past (January) and not about future periods, which leads to the classification as "not forward looking".

This sentence is not forward looking because it discusses past events, such as the increase in overseas Filipinos' remittances, export earnings, and foreign investment inflows, and how they have driven the expansion in domestic liquidity. There is no mention of future expectations, projections, or policy plans.
