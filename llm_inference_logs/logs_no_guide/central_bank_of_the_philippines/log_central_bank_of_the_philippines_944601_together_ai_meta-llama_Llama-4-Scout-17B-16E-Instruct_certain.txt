A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports specific historical data, indicating a factual and certain statement."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents concrete, factual information about past economic data, specifically percent increases and expansions in specific months, without any ambiguous language or expressions of doubt.

However, I can also argue that:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence uses the word 'expected', which implies a degree of uncertainty or prediction rather than a definite outcome."
}
```

Upon re-reading, I think the second output is more accurate. The sentence does express a degree of uncertainty or prediction about the future (at the time of writing), even though it's referring

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents a factual statement about the year-to-date growth rate (5.6 percent) and the government's growth target (7-8 percent), without using words or phrases that indicate uncertainty or doubt.
2025-04-14 14:19:08,424 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my output:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence uses the word 'generally' and 'moderate', which indicate a degree of uncertainty or vagueness in the assessment of demand conditions."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because the language used suggests that the improvements in demand conditions are not absolute or definitive, but rather general and moderate, implying some degree of uncertainty or nuance.
2025-04-14 14:19:08,425 - together_inference - INFO - Response: {

  "justification": "The sentence reports a forecasted value based on specific data from a defined period, indicating a statement of fact rather than uncertainty."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence provides specific numbers and percentages from a defined period (January-June 2002) and from a specific source (the DA), indicating a statement of fact rather than uncertainty.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence uses the word 'expected', which indicates a degree of uncertainty or unpredictability about the outcome."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because the use of "expected" implies that there is some doubt or unpredictability about whether the full operationalization of the first act will indeed address the rise in NPLs (non-performing loans).
2025-04-14 14:19:22,069 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Based on the given sentence, I would classify it as:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a forecast with specific numbers and reasons, indicating a statement of fact rather than uncertainty."
}
```

However, upon reevaluation considering the context of forecasting and potential variability in agricultural production:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains a forecast, which by its nature involves uncertainty, even though it provides specific numbers and reasons."
}
```

Forecasts inherently involve some level of uncertainty due to the unpredictability of future events and outcomes. Therefore, classifying
2025-04-14 14:19:22,069 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my output:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'remained on the downside' and 'uncertainty', indicating a degree of uncertainty or unpredictability."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it expresses a subjective assessment of risks and uncertainty, rather than stating a factual or definitive outcome.
2025-04-14 14:19:22,069 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my output:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes specific actions taken by the national government, indicating a level of certainty about the events described."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it reports on concrete measures implemented by the national government, such as rice imports, extension of lower tariff rates on pork imports, and relaxation of quantitative import restrictions for sugar processors, which are verifiable actions and do not express doubt or uncertainty.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports specific data and statistics, indicating a factual statement with no ambiguity or uncertainty."
}
```

This sentence reports specific data and statistics, such as the peso depreciation rate against the US dollar (9.8 percent year-to-date as of November 29, 2022, and 12.0 percent in October), which suggests a factual statement with no uncertainty. Therefore, I classified it as "certain".

2025-04-14 14:19:25,197 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence and provide a justification, I first need to correct and clarify the input sentence, as it appears to contain two separate statements. The corrected and clarified sentences are:

1. Based on the preliminary results of the January 2008 labor force survey (LFS), the unemployment rate declined to 7.4 percent.
2. Salaries of government employees are expected to increase by 10 percent effective July 2008.

Now, let's analyze each sentence:

### Sentence 1:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific data point from a survey, without any expression of doubt or ambiguity."
}
```

This sentence simply reports a factual piece of information about the average capacity utilization rate of the manufacturing sector, citing a specific source (the Philippine Statistics Authority's monthly integrated survey of selected industries). There is no language indicating uncertainty, prediction, or speculation, which suggests that the label "certain" is appropriate.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains conditional language ('could help soften') that indicates a possible but not guaranteed outcome."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it expresses a potential effect of lower domestic oil prices on inflation, rather than a definitive or guaranteed one. The use of the word "could" implies a degree of uncertainty or possibility, rather than certainty.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a clear and deliberate course of action by the Central Bank of the Philippines, indicating a certain future action."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it uses phrases such as "need to continuously assess", "respond in a measured fashion", and "in order to maintain", which convey a sense of determination and commitment to a specific policy approach. The language used is decisive and lacks ambiguity, suggesting that the described actions are likely to occur.

{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'likely' and 'expected', which indicate a degree of uncertainty or prediction rather than a statement of fact."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it expresses a prediction or expectation about future economic growth, rather than stating a fact. The use of words like "likely" and "expected" suggests that there is some degree of uncertainty or doubt about the outcome.

  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'expected' and 'could', which indicate a degree of uncertainty or prediction rather than a statement of fact."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it expresses a prediction or expectation about future events (price pressures dissipating) rather than stating a fact. The use of words like "expected" and "could" also suggests a degree of uncertainty or possibility rather than certainty.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific and factual decision made by the MWSS-RO, indicating a certain event."
}
```

Note that the sentence does not express any doubt, uncertainty, or future prediction, but rather states a historical fact about a specific decision made by a regulatory office. This suggests that the sentence is reporting a certain event. 

However, I must point out that the sentence seems unrelated to the Central Bank of the Philippines' monetary policy meeting as mentioned in the context.
