A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

2025-04-14 14:07:52,065 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence according to the Central Bank of the Philippines' monetary policy stance, let's analyze the content and implications of the sentence.

The sentence discusses the approval of the highlights of the discussions from a previous monetary board meeting, listing the individuals involved in the discussions. It does not directly mention or imply any decision regarding interest rates, inflation targeting, or any other monetary policy tool.

Given this context, the sentence appears to be more procedural or administrative in nature rather than conveying a stance on monetary policy.

Therefore, the classification should reflect that the sentence does not contain information relevant to understanding the monetary policy stance.

Here's the output following the required
2025-04-14 14:07:52,065 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence according to the Central Bank of the Philippines' monetary policy stance, let's analyze it step by step.

The sentence is: "these drivers of growth offset the negative contribution from exports."

1. **Understanding the sentence**: The sentence implies that certain factors are contributing positively to the economy (growth drivers) and are compensating for the negative impact caused by exports. This suggests a focus on the overall state of the economy and its growth dynamics.

2. **Relating to monetary policy stance**:
   - A "hawkish" stance typically indicates a focus on inflation control and potentially tightening monetary policy.
   - A "d
2025-04-14 14:07:52,065 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence regarding the Central Bank of the Philippines' (Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, BSP) monetary policy stance, let's analyze its content.

The sentence mentions that the monetary board approved to restore the tiering scheme on banks' placements with the BSP under the reverse repurchase (RRP) and special deposit account (SDA) windows. Restoring a tiering scheme can be associated with managing liquidity and potentially tightening monetary conditions by making it more attractive or less costly for banks to hold certain levels of reserves or deposits with the central bank, thus influencing interest rates and money supply.

Given this context, the action
2025-04-14 14:07:52,065 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence according to the Central Bank of the Philippines' monetary policy stance, let's analyze its content.

The sentence mentions that "current high fiscal deficits, record-low interest rates, large-scale monetary easing, and other government interventions are not sustainable" and suggests that "an expansion of private demand is necessary to drive the global recovery." This implies a recognition of the limits of current accommodative policies (monetary easing, low interest rates) and a shift towards looking for other drivers of recovery, rather than directly calling for more easing or tightening.

However, the tone is more about the unsustainability of current policies rather than directly advocating
2025-04-14 14:07:52,065 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence according to the Central Bank of the Philippines' monetary policy stance, let's analyze the information provided.

The sentence mentions: "the rates of expansion picked up in china, russia, and australia, but slowed in the us, japan, the uk, and india."

1. **Understanding the Context**: The sentence discusses the changes in economic expansion rates across various countries. An increase in the rate of expansion typically indicates economic growth, while a slowdown suggests a deceleration in economic activity.

2. **Analyzing the Information**: The sentence notes that the rates of expansion increased in countries like China, Russia, and Australia
