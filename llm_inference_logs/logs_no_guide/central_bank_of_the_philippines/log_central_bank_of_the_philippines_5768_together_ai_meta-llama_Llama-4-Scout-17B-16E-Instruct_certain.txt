A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a specific action taken by the monetary board, indicating a definitive outcome."
}
```

The sentence reports on a specific decision made by the monetary board, using phrases such as "by a unanimous vote" and "approved to restore", which indicate a certain or definitive action. There is no ambiguity or uncertainty expressed in the sentence.
2025-04-14 14:05:52,032 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a definitive view on the sustainability of current economic policies and the necessity of private demand for global recovery, using phrases like 'are not sustainable' and 'is necessary'."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it uses assertive language to convey a clear opinion on the state of economic policies and the requirements for global recovery, without expressing doubt or ambiguity.
2025-04-14 14:05:52,032 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my output:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports specific, factual changes in rates of expansion in various countries, without expressing doubt or ambiguity."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents information as factual and does not contain words or phrases that indicate uncertainty, such as "may," "could," "likely," or "it is expected that." The sentence simply reports on the changes in rates of expansion in several countries, which suggests a tone of objective reporting rather than speculative or uncertain language.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",

This sentence expresses a potential outcome that may or may not happen, which makes it uncertain. The use of "could" and the comparative phrase "compared to" suggests a hypothetical scenario, further supporting the classification as uncertain.

{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific and factual piece of information about the real GDP growth rate for the second quarter, which is a verifiable data point."

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it mentions a specific and verifiable data point (the real GDP growth rate of 7.9 percent for the second quarter), which is a factual piece of information that can be confirmed or denied. There is no ambiguity or uncertainty expressed in this part of the sentence.

The original sentence seems more like a phrase; a complete sentence could offer more clarity.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a conditional and subjective assessment of risks, using phrases such as 'remain tilted to the downside' and 'primary downside risk', indicating uncertainty."
}
```

This sentence is classified as uncertain because it uses phrases that convey a degree of subjectivity and conditionality, suggesting that the outcome is not guaranteed and is dependent on various factors, such as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence states a fact about the targets being set in coordination with a specific committee, indicating a level of definiteness and certainty."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents information as a fact, without any ambiguity or indication of doubt. The use of the phrase "these targets were set" suggests a completed action, and the mention of a specific committee ("DBCC") adds to the sense of concreteness and certainty.

{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence presents a specific and quantifiable effect of a 10 percent increase in power rates on average annual inflation, implying a definite outcome."

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence explicitly states that the monetary board decided to maintain the target RRP rate at 6.50 percent, indicating a definitive action."
}
```

This classification is based on the language used in the sentence, which clearly indicates a specific decision made by the monetary board, leaving no room for doubt or ambiguity.
2025-04-14 14:06:13,028 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports on past forecasts and expectations without expressing any doubt or ambiguity, indicating a certain tone."
}
```

Note that the sentence discusses past forecasts and expectations using phrases like "were broadly unchanged" and "growth expected to come from", which suggests a sense of factual reporting rather than uncertainty.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes specific historical events that have already occurred, indicating a certain outcome."
}
```

The sentence reports on past events that are known to have happened, such as the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the sale of Merrill Lynch & Co. to Bank of America, which are verifiable historical facts, hence the classification as "certain".
2025-04-14 14:06:13,028 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my output:

```

However, I realized that I need to consider if the sentence relates to Central Bank of the Philippines' monetary policy meeting. Given that there is no mention of the Central Bank of the Philippines or monetary policy in the sentence, but assuming it is related, here is my revised output:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a prediction about future inflation, using phrases like 'expectations' and 'would remain broadly in line', which indicate a degree of uncertainty."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it expresses a prediction about future inflation, which may not be known with certainty. The use of phrases like "expectations" and "would remain broadly in line" suggests that there is some degree of uncertainty or unpredictability involved.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains conditional language ('could help soften') that indicates a possible but not guaranteed outcome."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it expresses a potential effect of lower domestic oil prices on inflation, rather than a definitive or guaranteed one. The use of the word "could" implies a degree of uncertainty or possibility, rather than certainty.
