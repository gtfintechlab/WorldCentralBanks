A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

2025-04-14 14:09:01,841 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence discusses the unsustainability of current economic measures and the necessity of an expansion of private demand to drive global recovery. Although it contains a statement about the necessity of private demand expansion, the context is about future economic recovery and the sustainability of current measures, which involves some level of prediction or expectation.

However, the key phrases "are not sustainable" and "is necessary" convey a sense of certainty regarding the unsustainability of current measures and the need for private demand expansion. The language used is assertive and does not express doubt about these conditions.

Therefore, the
2025-04-14 14:09:01,841 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence states: "the rates of expansion picked up in china, russia, and australia, but slowed in the us, japan, the uk, and india."

This sentence is reporting factual information about the rates of expansion in various countries. It does not contain any speculative or predictive language that would indicate uncertainty.

The sentence provided is: "nevertheless, the growth in agriculture is projected to accelerate in the quarter due to higher palay and corn production."

Let's break down the task:

The sentence discusses various factors that "exerted pressures on the exchange rate," including "market fears" over several geopolitical tensions and events. The use of the phrase "market fears" indicates a discussion of perceived or anticipated impacts rather than stating facts or certain outcomes. The overall context is about influences on the exchange rate due to various tensions and events, which suggests a level of speculation or uncertainty about future outcomes or the magnitude of the impacts.

The sentence is: "the futures price curve remained in backwardation, though the path appears to be noticeably lower compared to early november given increased downside risks to global oil demand."

First, we observe that the sentence contains a mix of factual observation and interpretation. The phrase "remained in backwardation" is a factual statement about the futures price curve's condition. However, the comparison "noticeably lower compared to early November" introduces an element of judgment regarding the degree of change. Most importantly, the phrase "appears to be" indicates a level of uncertainty or interpretation regarding
2025-04-14 14:09:43,281 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and implications.

The sentence is: "mean inflation forecasts from surveys of private sector economists continued to show generally elevated inflation expectations for 2018-2020."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence is discussing forecasts and expectations, which inherently involve some level of uncertainty because they are about future events or outcomes.

2. **Justification**: The use of "forecasts" and "expectations" indicates that the statement is about predictions rather than confirmed facts, suggesting uncertainty.

Given these considerations, the output should be:

2025-04-14 14:09:43,281 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, we need to analyze its content and tone to determine if it expresses certainty or uncertainty regarding the information it conveys about the Central Bank of the Philippines' monetary policy meeting or related data.

The sentence provided is: "the december imports brought the full year growth to 5.7 percent, slightly below the 7.2 percent recorded a year ago."

Let's break down the task:

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence reports a factual piece of information regarding the full-year import growth rate and compares it to the previous year's rate. It does not contain speculative language or express doubt.

2. **Justification**:
2025-04-14 14:09:43,281 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To accurately classify the given sentence, we first need to examine it: "growth in the previous month."

Given its incomplete nature, the sentence lacks context necessary for a definitive classification. However, based on the information provided and typical characteristics of certain or uncertain statements, we can attempt a classification.

The sentence appears to be a fragment and does not directly convey a statement that is typically classified as certain or uncertain without additional context. Nonetheless, we can infer that it might be referring to an economic or financial context given the topic.

Since the sentence is incomplete and lacks a clear assertion or statement regarding the Central Bank of the Philippines' monetary policy meeting,

2025-04-14 14:09:55,902 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence provided is: "the increase in the forecasted inflation path for 2016 – 2017 could be attributed mainly to the higher-than-expected inflation in november 2015 and the depreciation of the peso, which were partly offset by the decline in global crude oil prices."

First, we observe the language used. The sentence contains the word "could," which is a modal verb often used to express possibility or potential rather than certainty.

Given this observation, let's assign a label and provide a justification.
