A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence reports on past events and meetings, without discussing future plans, projections, or guidance."
}
```

This sentence appears to be a factual report on past meetings and decisions, without expressing any views or intentions about future monetary policy actions. Therefore, it is classified as "not forward looking".
2025-04-14 14:06:59,645 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my output:

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses past or current drivers of growth and their impact on exports, without referencing future events or projections."
}
```
2025-04-14 14:06:59,645 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a past decision made by the monetary board, specifically the approval to restore the tiering scheme, indicating it is not forward looking."
}
```

This sentence is not forward looking because it describes a decision that has already been made, rather than providing guidance or projections about future monetary policy actions.
2025-04-14 14:06:59,645 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses future requirements for global recovery and the necessity of private demand expansion, indicating a focus on future events or prospects."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "forward looking" because it talks about what is necessary for the future global recovery, specifically mentioning that an expansion of private demand is necessary to drive the global recovery "beyond the impact of the various stimuli". This implies a focus on future events or prospects, rather than simply describing current situations or past actions.
2025-04-14 14:06:59,645 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence reports on past or current economic trends in various countries, without expressing a future expectation or prediction."
}
```

This sentence is not forward looking because it simply states the rates of expansion in various countries without providing any information about future expectations, projections, or plans, which are typical characteristics of forward-looking statements.

I classified the sentence as "forward looking" because it discusses a future implication ("implies a continuing environment") of a potential future scenario (sustained high international oil prices and associated adjustments in costs).
2025-04-14 14:07:34,783 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To accurately classify the given sentence and provide a justification, I will first identify and correct what appears to be a formatting or typographical error in the provided input. It seems there are two separate sentences:

1. "The NG recorded a P90.2-billion fiscal deficit for Q1 2019, which is forty-one percent lower than that recorded in"
2. "Global economic growth is seen to slow down in 2019 but is expected to pick up in 2020."

Given these are two sentences, I will analyze the second one as it directly pertains to a forward-looking statement regarding economic growth.

```

I chose "not forward looking" because the sentence focuses on explaining past events (higher-than-expected inflation in November 2015, depreciation of the peso, and decline in global crude oil prices) and their effects on inflation forecasts for 2016-2017, rather than discussing future expectations or projections.
