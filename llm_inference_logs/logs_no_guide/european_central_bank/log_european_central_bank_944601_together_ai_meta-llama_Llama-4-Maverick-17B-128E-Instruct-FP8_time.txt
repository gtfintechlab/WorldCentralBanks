A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "wage dynamics appeared to have gained momentum since the turn of 2017-18, with annual growth in compensation per employee reaching 2.9% in the third quarter of 2018."

Let's break it down:

1. The sentence discusses "wage dynamics" and their change over time.
2. It mentions that the change happened "since the turn of 2017-18," indicating a reference to a period that started in the past and continued into
2025-04-14 23:33:07,996 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, "several factors had contributed to this situation," we need to analyze its content and determine if it refers to future events, expectations, or guidance, which would categorize it as "forward looking," or if it discusses past events or current states without referencing the future, making it "not forward looking."

The sentence is discussing factors that "had contributed," which indicates a past action or state.

Therefore, the classification is as follows:

The sentence is: "moreover, the concern was raised that, if the governing council deviated from its earlier guidance and surprised markets with a larger than expected increase, this would add to the prevailing market uncertainties."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence discusses a hypothetical future action of the governing council (deviating from its earlier guidance and surprising markets with a larger than expected increase) and its potential impact. This indicates it is discussing future possibilities or consequences.

2. **Justification**: The sentence is classified based on whether it looks forward in time, discussing potential future

The sentence discusses the impact of the UK referendum on global financial markets and mentions "perceptions of possible policy reactions." This indicates a discussion about potential future actions or consequences.

Given this, the classification can be determined as follows:

The sentence is: "labour markets remained resilient on the back of strong fiscal support but some indicators pointed to vulnerabilities further ahead."

1. **Understanding the task**: We need to determine if the sentence is "forward looking" or "not forward looking" in the context of the European Central Bank's monetary policy meeting.

2. **Analyzing the sentence**: The sentence discusses the current state of labour markets ("remained resilient") and mentions that some indicators suggest vulnerabilities "further ahead."
