A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

Although the sentence mentions that "all instruments needed to remain on the table", which could be seen as a hint at future actions, the overall tone and content focus on evaluating past decisions ("recalibration of instruments decided on in december") and their current appropriateness, rather than explicitly outlining future plans or projections. Therefore, I classify it as "not forward looking".
