A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that the economy is experiencing weakness, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

The sentence implies that the economic conditions are fragile and might require supportive measures, which is a dovish signal. There is no mention of inflation concerns or strong economic growth, which are typically associated with hawkish stances. The tone is also not neutral, as it highlights specific economic weaknesses, and it is relevant to monetary policy discussions, so it is not classified as "irrelevant".

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that the financial markets' reaction to the Governing Council's decision led to a loosening of financial conditions, implying a more accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

The sentence implies that the Governing Council's decision and communication led to a loosening of financial conditions, which is a dovish stance, as it suggests that the Council is willing to ease monetary policy or keep it accommodative.
2025-04-14 23:23:36,059 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies that new restrictions could necessitate further accommodative measures, suggesting a softer monetary policy stance."
}
```

The sentence mentions "tighter restrictions than had been anticipated" which could have a negative impact on the economy, suggesting that the ECB might maintain or implement more accommodative monetary policies, which is a dovish stance.
2025-04-14 23:23:36,059 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies that the European Central Bank's past policy rate increases are still having a restrictive effect on financing costs, suggesting a bias towards tighter monetary policy."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence describes financing costs as "restrictive", which suggests that the ECB's monetary policy stance is biased towards tightening, which is a hawkish stance.
2025-04-14 23:23:36,059 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence focuses on fiscal policies and provides guidance on government support measures, but does not directly indicate a tightening or loosening of monetary policy, hence it is classified as neutral."
}
```

Note that the sentence does not provide information about the European Central Bank's (ECB) monetary policy stance, but rather discusses fiscal policies. However, the tone of the sentence is not directly supportive of expansionary monetary policy (which would be dovish) or restrictive monetary policy (which would be hawkish), and it does not seem unrelated to economic

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that inflation is not a pressing concern, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance."

```

The sentence implies that the European Central Bank may not need to tighten monetary policy due to subdued inflation, which is a dovish signal.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions geopolitical uncertainties but does not provide any direct indication of a shift in monetary policy stance, suggesting a neutral tone."
}

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply states a fact about the prevailing geopolitical uncertainties without expressing any clear inclination towards tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) monetary policy.
2025-04-14 23:23:37,415 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions international coordination as important but does not provide any specific indication of a tightening or loosening of monetary policy."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence does not contain any language that suggests a more hawkish (tightening) or dovish (loosening) stance on monetary policy. The focus on international coordination is a neutral statement that does not imply a specific direction for policy.
2025-04-14 23:23:37,415 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a concern about inflation expectations becoming unanchored, suggesting a cautious tone towards inflation, which is characteristic of a hawkish stance."
}
```

In this classification, "hawkish" refers to a monetary policy stance that prioritizes controlling inflation over stimulating economic growth. The sentence's mention of the risk of longer-term inflation expectations becoming unanchored indicates a concern about inflation, which aligns with a hawkish perspective.
2025-04-14 23:23:37,415 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides an objective assessment of the global economic activity without indicating any inclination towards tightening or loosening monetary policy."
}
```

The sentence simply reports on the improvement in global economic activity and its synchronization without expressing any concern about inflation (which would be hawkish) or growth (which would be dovish), hence it's classified as neutral.

{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that banks are becoming more cautious and less willing to lend, which could indicate a tighter monetary policy stance."
}
```

However, upon re-reading, I realize that the sentence actually describes a tightening of credit standards and a drop in loan demand, which is more related to a decrease in lending and therefore could be associated with a dovish stance as it might imply that the economy needs support.

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The mention of upside risks to inflation, particularly from energy and food prices, suggests a concern about inflationary pressures, which is a characteristic of a hawkish monetary policy stance."
}
```

This sentence indicates that the speaker is concerned about potential inflationary pressures, which is a hawkish view. A hawkish stance typically emphasizes the need to control inflation, often through tighter monetary policy, such as raising interest rates.
2025-04-14 23:23:38,960 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions an 'environment of accommodative monetary policy', which implies a loose monetary policy stance, characteristic of a dovish tone."
}
```

This classification is based on the understanding that:

- "Hawkish" refers to a monetary policy stance that is restrictive or tight, often to combat inflation.
- "Dovish" refers to a monetary policy stance that is accommodative or loose, aimed at stimulating economic growth.
- "Neutral" refers to a balanced or middle-ground stance that does not lean towards tightening or easing

  "justification": "The sentence implies a supportive monetary policy stance by highlighting the importance of bank credit for small and medium-sized enterprises, suggesting a willingness to provide easy credit conditions."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "dovish" because it indicates a focus on supporting specific sectors (small and medium-sized enterprises) through bank credit, which is a accommodative monetary policy measure. This suggests that the European Central Bank is likely to maintain or implement loose monetary policies to help these enterprises.

2025-04-14 23:23:42,581 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance of the given sentence and provide a justification, let's analyze it step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the context of the sentence
The sentence discusses the movement of rates on corporate loans, noting they have been moving sideways in nominal terms and upwards in real terms, which has dampened demand for external finance. This context is related to the effects of interest rates on the economy, specifically on corporate borrowing.

## 2: Determine the implications of the sentence on monetary policy stance
- A "hawkish" stance refers to a preference for raising interest rates to control inflation or slow down an overheating economy
2025-04-14 23:23:42,581 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual update on loan growth without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance, hence it is neutral."
}
```

The sentence simply reports a data point without any implication for future policy actions, which is why I classify it as neutral. There is no indication of a hawkish (more aggressive) or dovish (more accommodative) stance.
2025-04-14 23:23:42,581 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence does not indicate any change in the monetary policy stance, but rather explains the movement in equity prices, suggesting a neutral tone."
}
```

The sentence does not suggest that the European Central Bank is tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) its monetary policy, but rather provides an explanation for a market movement, which is a neutral observation. Therefore, I classify it as "neutral".
2025-04-14 23:23:42,581 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that additional measures may not be necessary at the current juncture, implying a cautious or restrictive stance on monetary policy."
}
```

This sentence implies that the speaker is not advocating for immediate action, which is a hawkish stance, as it suggests a more restrictive or cautious approach to monetary policy.
2025-04-14 23:23:42,581 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence presents a balanced view of the labour market, highlighting both resilience and potential vulnerabilities, without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence provides a mixed assessment of the labour market, neither strongly suggesting a need for policy tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish), but rather presenting a balanced view that could be interpreted as supporting the current policy stance.

## Step 1: Understand the Context
The sentence mentions a specific financial indicator: "the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead now stood at 1.32%". This indicator is related to market expectations of inflation.

## 2: Interpret the Indicator
The five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate is a measure that reflects market participants' expectations for inflation over a specific period in the future. A higher rate indicates higher expected inflation, while a lower rate suggests lower expected inflation.

This sentence simply reports on the current state of inflation without suggesting any action or change in the monetary policy stance, which is why it's classified as "neutral".
2025-04-14 23:23:55,133 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the sentence and provide a justification, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Understanding the Context**: The sentence refers to the European Central Bank's (ECB) monetary policy, specifically mentioning the maintenance of relative shares at levels prevailing at the end of the net purchase phase. This context suggests a discussion about quantitative easing or a similar asset purchase program, which is a tool used in monetary policy.

2. **Interpreting the Sentence**: The sentence implies a continuation or a specific condition related to the asset purchase program ("net purchase phase"). By stating that "their relative shares would be maintained," it suggests a level of stability or

{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The mention of an inflation risk premium that has turned positive suggests a concern about potential inflationary pressures, which is a hawkish stance."

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence focuses on facilitating a better assessment of economic conditions, indicating a data-dependent approach without signaling a specific policy direction."
}
```

This sentence appears to be neutral as it does not indicate a clear direction for monetary policy, but rather a desire to gather more information to inform future decisions.

This classification is based on the idea that a dovish stance is associated with a more accommodative monetary policy, which is implied by the sentence's suggestion that inflationary pressures are temporary and will dissipate over time.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that lower energy prices could lead to downward pressure on wage claims, implying a potential easing of monetary policy or a less aggressive stance."
}
```

This sentence implies a dovish stance because it hints at the possibility of a less restrictive monetary policy environment if certain economic conditions are met, specifically if lower energy prices reduce the cost of living and subsequently dampen wage growth.
2025-04-14 23:24:01,198 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a decrease in energy inflation, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance, indicating a dovish tone."
}
```

The reasoning behind this classification is that a decrease in inflationary pressures (in this case, energy inflation) can be seen as a factor that might lead to a more dovish monetary policy stance, as it reduces the need for aggressive tightening. This is because lower inflation can be associated with weaker economic growth, which might require more supportive monetary policy.

This sentence appears to be a factual reference to previous communication and does not indicate a change in the monetary policy stance, hence the classification as "neutral".

  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual update on the euro's exchange rate without expressing a clear stance on future monetary policy, indicating a neutral tone."
}
```

The sentence simply reports on the exchange rate movements of the euro without suggesting any implications for monetary policy, which is characteristic of a neutral stance. There is no indication of a hawkish (concerned about inflation and potentially raising interest rates) or dovish (concerned about growth and potentially lowering interest rates) tone. Therefore, the label "neutral" is assigned.

## Step 1: Understand the Context
The sentence compares the change in something (likely interest rates or bond yields) between the United States and another region, presumably the Eurozone, given the context of the European Central Bank (ECB).

## 2: Identify Key Information
The key information in the sentence is the comparison of an increase: "by contrast, in the united states they had increased by more than 20 basis points." This implies a discussion about the tightening of monetary policy or a decrease in bond prices (
2025-04-14 23:24:05,691 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that the effects of high inflation on households' purchasing power may be mitigated, implying a potentially less aggressive monetary policy stance."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "dovish" because it implies that the economic situation may not require a strong tightening of monetary policy, which is a dovish stance. The sentence focuses on the potential offsetting effects of rising wages and falling energy prices on households' purchasing power, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy.
2025-04-14 23:24:05,691 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that inflation is expected to decline, which implies that there may be less need for aggressive monetary policy tightening, a dovish stance."
}
```

The reasoning behind this classification is that the sentence implies a decrease in inflationary pressures, which is often associated with a dovish monetary policy stance, as it suggests that the central bank may not need to raise interest rates or take other tightening measures.
2025-04-14 23:24:05,691 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions uncertainty surrounding the inflation outlook without expressing a clear concern about inflation being too high or too low, indicating a neutral stance."
}
```

This sentence does not express a clear hawkish (concerned about high inflation) or dovish (concerned about low inflation or economic growth) tone. Instead, it highlights uncertainty and various factors influencing inflation, which is consistent with a neutral monetary policy stance.
2025-04-14 23:24:05,691 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides factual data on employment growth in the manufacturing sector and market services, without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply reports economic data without suggesting any implications for monetary policy or expressing a view on the economy that would lean towards a more hawkish (tightening) or dovish (loosening) stance.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence simply states a fact about the tone in financial markets without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance, hence it is neutral."
}
```

The sentence does not suggest that the European Central Bank is likely to tighten (hawkish) or loosen (dovish) its monetary policy, but rather describes the market tone as positive, which does not directly relate to the bank's policy stance. Therefore, the label "neutral" is assigned.
2025-04-14 23:24:07,251 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The mention of inflation expectations being skewed to the upside suggests a concern about inflation, which is typically associated with a hawkish monetary policy stance."
}
```

This sentence implies that the speaker is concerned about the potential for inflation to rise, which is a hawkish view. A hawkish stance is characterized by a concern for controlling inflation, often leading to tighter monetary policy.
2025-04-14 23:24:07,251 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a cautious and vigilant approach, indicating a neutral stance as it emphasizes looking through current disruptions while monitoring inflation expectations."
}
```

This sentence does not indicate a clear direction towards tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) monetary policy but rather emphasizes stability and careful monitoring, which aligns with a neutral stance.
2025-04-14 23:24:07,251 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that a highly accommodative monetary policy stance will be maintained for a prolonged period, indicating a preference for loose monetary policy, which is characteristic of a dovish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the language used in the sentence, which implies that the European Central Bank is likely to maintain an accommodative monetary policy stance for an extended period, which is a key aspect of a dovish monetary policy stance.
2025-04-14 23:24:07,251 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a decreasing trend in bank lending rates, which implies an accommodative monetary policy stance, characteristic of a dovish tone."
}
```

This classification indicates that the sentence has a dovish tone, as it implies that the European Central Bank's monetary policy is likely to be eased or remain loose, supporting economic growth.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence is descriptive and discusses the impact of monetary policy on emerging market economies without expressing a clear stance on future policy actions."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence provides an objective analysis of the effects of monetary policy on emerging market economies, without indicating a tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) of policy. The tone is informative and observational, rather than advocating for a specific policy direction.

{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that the monetary policy in the euro area is expected to normalize at a slower pace than in other economies, implying a more accommodative stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the implication that a slower pace of normalization suggests a more dovish or accommodative monetary policy stance, which is less likely to tighten policy quickly.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that a recession would mitigate inflationary pressures, implying a potential easing of monetary policy, which is a dovish stance."
}
```

This sentence implies that the speaker is concerned about the economic downturn and its impact on inflation, which is a characteristic of a dovish monetary policy stance. A dovish stance typically prioritizes economic growth and employment over inflation control, and the mention of mitigating inflationary pressures due to a recession suggests a more accommodative policy approach.

{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence focuses on the role of macroprudential policy in preserving financial stability, without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance or inclination towards tightening or easing."

2025-04-14 23:24:14,832 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that the outlook for price stability has not fundamentally changed, indicating no inclination towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
}
```

This sentence implies that the European Central Bank's view on inflation and price stability remains steady, without signaling a shift towards a more hawkish (tightening) or dovish (easing) stance. Therefore, the label "neutral" is assigned.
2025-04-14 23:24:14,832 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a cautious outlook on economic recovery, implying that the ECB might maintain or adopt a loose monetary policy stance."
}
```

The sentence implies a cautious or pessimistic view on the economy, which is typically associated with a dovish monetary policy stance, as it may lead to or maintain accommodative policies to stimulate the economy.
2025-04-14 23:24:14,832 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence does not mention any monetary policy decision or stance, making it irrelevant to the classification of the European Central Bank's monetary policy stance."
}
```

I chose "irrelevant" because the sentence discusses a change in investors' assessment of the economic impact of the omicron variant, but does not provide any information about the European Central Bank's monetary policy stance.
2025-04-14 23:24:14,833 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses concern about global shocks but does not indicate a clear inclination towards tightening or easing monetary policy, suggesting a neutral stance."
}
```

The sentence does not contain language that suggests a hawkish (inflation-fighting, potentially rate-hiking) or dovish (growth-supporting, potentially rate-cutting) tone. Instead, it highlights a concern about global risks and their potential impact on euro area financial markets, which is a neutral observation. Therefore, the label "neutral" is assigned.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that market participants expect additional rate cuts by the end of the year, indicating a more accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence implies an expectation of rate cuts, which is a dovish signal. The increase in expected rate cuts from two to between two and three also suggests a shift towards a more dovish stance.
2025-04-14 23:24:16,322 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides factual information about external financing flows to euro area non-financial corporations without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply reports on a specific economic development without suggesting any tightening or loosening of monetary policy, nor does it imply any future changes in policy.
2025-04-14 23:24:16,322 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses concerns about the labour market and growth dynamics, suggesting a cautious tone that is typically associated with a dovish monetary policy stance."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "dovish" because it highlights concerns about the economy, which is a tone that is often linked to a more accommodative monetary policy. This type of language is often used by central banks to signal that they may be willing to ease policy or keep policy loose for longer, which is a dovish stance.
2025-04-14 23:24:16,322 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a continuation of current policies without introducing new measures or changes, indicating a neutral stance."
}
```

The sentence suggests that the European Central Bank plans to maintain its current level of control over the monetary policy stance and ensure that interest rate decisions are fully transmitted to money markets, without hinting at tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) policies. Therefore, the label "neutral" is assigned.
2025-04-14 23:24:16,322 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides an observation about market trends and yield spreads, but does not convey a clear stance on monetary policy, making it neutral."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence appears to be descriptive, discussing market trends and yield spreads without expressing a clear opinion or direction on monetary policy, which would be characteristic of a hawkish or dovish stance.

{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence simply states a fact about the transmission of monetary policy without indicating a tightening or loosening of policy, hence it is neutral."

{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a downward pressure on inflation expectations and muted underlying inflation, implying a potential need for accommodative monetary policy, which is a dovish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the context that a dovish monetary policy stance is associated with a more accommodative or expansionary policy, often in response to low inflation or economic weakness. The sentence's mention of declining inflation expectations and muted underlying inflation suggests that the economic conditions are not strong enough to warrant a tightening of monetary policy, which aligns with a dovish view.
