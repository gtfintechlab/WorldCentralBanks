A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence describes past or current economic conditions and does not express a prediction or projection about future economic developments."
}
```

Although the sentence mentions the "first quarter of 2021", which is in the future from the time the sentence was likely written, the sentence is describing what indicators "pointed to" which suggests it is describing data that was available up to a certain point in the past, rather than making a prediction about the future. The sentence is primarily focused on summarizing current or past data rather than expressing a forward-looking view
2025-04-14 23:25:11,065 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses past events and reactions to previous decisions, without expressing a future outlook or prediction."
}
```

This sentence is not forward looking because it analyzes past reactions to previous decisions (the October decision and the September meeting), without discussing potential future actions, outcomes, or projections.

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses past events and updates to previous projections, rather than making statements about future economic conditions or policy actions."
}
```

This sentence is not forward looking because it focuses on describing past developments and revisions to earlier projections, rather than expressing expectations or plans for future events.
2025-04-14 23:25:11,065 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",

}
```
2025-04-14 23:25:11,065 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses future government support measures and provides guidance on their desirable characteristics, indicating a forward-looking perspective."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "forward looking" because it provides guidance on future policy actions (government support measures) and their desired features, implying a prospective orientation.

2025-04-14 23:25:44,507 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence and provide a justification, let's analyze it step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Sentence
The sentence provided is: "the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead had been broadly stable around 1.7% since the governing council’s january monetary policy meeting, following an earlier upward trend." This sentence discusses a specific financial indicator (five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead) and its behavior over time.

## 2: Identify Key Phrases
Key phrases in the sentence include "five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead," which indicates a future-looking financial instrument
2025-04-14 23:25:44,507 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence contains future-oriented language, specifically mentioning extending a policy beyond March 2017, indicating a forward-looking perspective."
}
```
2025-04-14 23:25:44,507 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence is forward looking because it discusses future projections and expectations about core inflation over a specific horizon."
}
```

The sentence contains phrases such as "would remain above 2% over the projection horizon" that indicate a focus on future events or projections, which is a characteristic of forward-looking statements.
