A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents a factual observation about the past behavior of yield spreads, without expressing any doubt or uncertainty. The use of specific details, such as "in recent weeks" and "unlike in periods of broad risk aversion", also suggests a statement of fact rather than an uncertain or hypothetical one.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a expectation based on a specific condition without any indication of doubt or ambiguity."
}
```

However, I can also argue that it is uncertain because it uses "was expected" which implies a level of uncertainty. Here is an alternative classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence uses 'was expected', which implies a level of uncertainty or unpredictability about the future outcome."
}
```

In this case, I think the second classification is more accurate, as "was expected" does

  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a clear and definitive view on the appropriateness of the recalibration of instruments, indicating a sense of certainty."
}
```

Although the sentence mentions that "all instruments needed to remain on the table" and considers "possible unintended side effects", the main clause "it was widely felt that the recalibration of instruments decided on in december remained appropriate and well-balanced" suggests a strong consensus, leaning towards certainty. 

However, an alternative and arguably better answer could be:

  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains conditional phrases and words with uncertain meanings, such as 'could' and 'currently expected', indicating a degree of uncertainty."

This sentence expresses a possibility rather than a fact, and the use of "could" and "currently expected" suggests that the outcome is not guaranteed, hence the classification as uncertain.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence uses assertive language and makes definitive statements about the state of the economy, indicating a tone of certainty."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it uses phrases such as "underlying price pressures remained strong", "inflation... was rising", and "would continue to exert pressure", which convey a sense of confidence and definiteness. There are no hedging words or phrases that suggest uncertainty.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes past events using the past perfect tense, indicating that the information is presented as factual and certain."
}
```

The sentence uses the past perfect tense ("had been"), which suggests that the events described are viewed as completed and factual, rather than uncertain or speculative. This indicates that the sentence is presenting information as certain.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports specific, factual data and statistics, indicating a certain state of affairs regarding commodity prices and exchange rates."
}
```

The sentence presents specific numbers and changes in prices and exchange rates, without any hedging or modal verbs that would suggest uncertainty. This suggests that the sentence is reporting objective facts, which corresponds to a "certain" classification.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a specific market trend that has occurred, using the past tense and precise language, indicating a certain and factual statement."

```

This sentence is classified as "certain" because it reports on a specific event that has happened, using verbs in the past tense ("had led", "declining") and describing a clear and observable trend in the market. There is no ambiguity or uncertainty expressed in the sentence.
2025-04-14 23:19:24,929 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence as certain or uncertain and provide a justification, let's analyze it:

```
{
"label": "uncertain",
"justification": "The sentence is incomplete and contains vague terms like 'in particular' and 'i.e.', indicating uncertainty or a lack of specificity."
}
```

The classification as "uncertain" is based on the sentence's structure and the presence of phrases that typically precede further specification or examples, suggesting that a definitive statement has not been made

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses uncertainty about the projected duration of the economic slowdown and its impact on the medium-term inflation outlook."
}
```

I chose "uncertain" because the sentence explicitly mentions "high" uncertainty and phrases such as "remained high" and "affecting", which indicate a lack of confidence in the predictions.

{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence presents a factual analysis of economic data and its implications, without expressing any doubt or ambiguity."

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it describes a specific economic situation and its causes using assertive language, without any hedging or uncertainty. The sentence appears to be a statement of fact based on data and analysis, rather than a speculative or uncertain claim.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports historical data and specific facts about the annual growth in broad money (M3) and its supporting factors, without expressing any doubt or ambiguity."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents factual information about past data and specific economic indicators, without using words or phrases that suggest uncertainty, such as "likely," "may," "could," or "uncertain." The language used is descriptive and reporting-oriented, indicating a tone of factual reporting rather than speculative or uncertain discussion.

However, I must note that the sentence seems unrelated to the European Central Bank's monetary policy meeting. If you'd like me to reclassify a sentence actually related to the topic, please provide it. 

If I were to assume a sentence related to monetary policy (e.g., "The European Central Bank will definitely keep interest rates unchanged during the next meeting."), I would classify it as:
