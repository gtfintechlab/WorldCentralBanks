A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes past data and indicators as having 'pointed to' a specific economic condition, implying a level of factual certainty."
}
```

However, upon re-reading, I realize that the sentence is actually describing a situation based on various indicators and data, but the economic weakness is a conclusion drawn from those indicators. The language used ("pointed to") suggests a degree of confidence, but the situation is still an interpretation of data. Therefore, I would revise my response to:

```

2025-04-14 23:24:26,393 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a specific past event and its effects, using verbs in the past tense, indicating a level of certainty about what happened."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it reports on a specific past event (the financial markets' reaction to the Governing Council's October decision and communication) and its consequences, using verbs in the past tense, which suggests that the speaker is describing a known and actual occurrence rather than a hypothetical or uncertain one.
2025-04-14 23:24:26,393 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions that further measures 'had been taken, or had been announced' and restrictions were 'tighter than had been anticipated', indicating uncertainty about future developments."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "uncertain" because it discusses potential future measures and their impacts, which are not yet known, and compares them to previous projections, indicating a degree of unpredictability.
2025-04-14 23:24:26,393 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a past state of financing costs as a fact, without expressing any doubt or uncertainty about the situation."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "certain" because it presents a factual statement about the past state of financing costs in the euro area, using the past tense and a neutral tone, without any language that suggests uncertainty or doubt.
2025-04-14 23:24:26,393 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```

The sentence reports a factual observation about the movement of rates on corporate loans, using the past tense ("had been moving") to describe a specific, identified trend. This suggests that the sentence is describing a certain state of affairs, rather than expressing uncertainty or possibility.

```

The sentence expresses a possibility rather than a definitive statement, and the language used suggests that the outcome is not predetermined, which is why I classify it as uncertain.
2025-04-14 23:24:31,633 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses uncertainty about the future by using phrases such as 'some indicators pointed to vulnerabilities further ahead', indicating a lack of confidence in the prediction."
}
```

This classification is based on the presence of phrases that indicate uncertainty or doubt about future events, which suggests that the sentence is expressing an uncertain view rather than a certain one.

{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence uses phrases such as 'in principle' and 'should', which introduce a degree of conditionality and uncertainty, suggesting that the outcome is not entirely predictable."
}
```

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a specific interpretation of the effects of the governing council's forward guidance on market expectations, implying a level of confidence and certainty about the outcome."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it uses phrases such as "was also seen as having important implications" and "had provided a useful anchor", which suggest a level of confidence and conviction about the effects of the governing council's actions, rather than expressing doubt or uncertainty.

{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports on past conditions using specific and definite language, indicating a factual statement about the state of financial conditions in the euro area."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it uses specific and definite language to describe the state of financial conditions in the euro area, without expressing any doubt or uncertainty. The use of phrases such as "had overall remained largely unchanged" and "were tighter than before the crisis" suggests a factual report rather than a speculative or uncertain statement.

{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses uncertainty due to the use of phrases such as 'although' and 'some deterioration', which indicate a degree of ambiguity and unpredictability."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because, despite mentioning that financial conditions "remained supportive", it also highlights potential negative developments ("repricing in some financial market segments", "deterioration") and uses hedging language ("some deterioration", "in particular"), which introduces uncertainty.

{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses concerns and raises questions about the durability of the labour market, indicating uncertainty about future developments."
}

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence uses a definitive tone and lacks conditional language, indicating a statement of fact rather than a speculative or uncertain claim."
}
```

The sentence implies a sense of definiteness and confidence, suggesting that the European Central Bank will indeed maintain control over the monetary policy stance and ensure the pass-through of interest rate decisions. The use of "would also maintain" and "ensure" suggests a level of certainty and commitment.

{
  "label": "certain",

```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents a factual observation about the past behavior of yield spreads, without expressing any doubt or uncertainty. The use of specific details, such as "in recent weeks" and "unlike in periods of broad risk aversion", also suggests a statement of fact rather than an uncertain or hypothetical one.

Given sentence: "a “blackout period”, i.e."

This sentence seems incomplete as presented, but we can infer its meaning. A "blackout period" typically refers to a time during which certain communications are restricted, often in the context of financial events or announcements to prevent influencing market movements.
