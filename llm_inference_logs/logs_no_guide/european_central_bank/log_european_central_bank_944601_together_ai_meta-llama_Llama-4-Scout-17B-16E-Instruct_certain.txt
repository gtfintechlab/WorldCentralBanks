A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a clear and definitive statement about the analysis of underlying inflation pressures, without any ambiguity or uncertainty."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it makes a definitive statement about the analysis of underlying inflation pressures, using phrases such as "it would therefore be beneficial to explain" and "went well beyond core inflation", which convey a sense of clarity and confidence.

2025-04-14 23:29:33,496 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'expected' and 'likely' that indicate a degree of uncertainty or prediction rather than a statement of fact."
}
```

This classification is based on the presence of words that soften the tone of the statement, suggesting that the outcome is predicted or probable rather than certain.
2025-04-14 23:29:33,496 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a confident view about the impact of recent monetary policy decisions on financing conditions and their expected effect on consumption and investment."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it uses phrases like "had improved" and "should support", which convey a sense of confidence and predictability about the outcome of the monetary policy decisions. There are no words or phrases that suggest uncertainty or doubt.

  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions a probability of a rate hike as 'well over one in two', implying a likelihood but not a certainty."
}
```

This classification is based on the language used in the sentence, which suggests a degree of uncertainty by framing the possibility of a rate hike in terms of probability rather than stating it as a fact.

}
```

Although the sentence mentions "increased global uncertainty", which might suggest uncertainty, the phrase "in an environment of" indicates that this uncertainty is a contextual condition, rather than a description of the events themselves. The main clause describes specific, observed changes, which are stated as facts, hence the classification as "certain".

{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a historical fact about the ECB staff macroeconomic projections, which can be verified and is stated as a fact."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it reports a specific event that occurred in the past (the September 2022 ECB staff macroeconomic projections) and states a factual change (a significant upward revision to inflation) that can be verified. There is no ambiguity or uncertainty expressed in the sentence.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a past event and its effects, stating a factual outcome without any ambiguity or uncertainty."
}
```

The sentence reports on a historical event (past cuts in the rate) and its consequences, using the past tense and stating a clear cause-and-effect relationship, which indicates a certain classification.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a possibility or an observation rather than a definitive statement, using phrases like 'some remarks were made suggesting' and 'should not be overlooked'."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it does not make a definitive statement about the inflation outlook, but rather reports on some remarks that were made, suggesting a possibility or an observation. The language used is cautious and tentative, indicating uncertainty.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a clear agreement on the need for further interest rate hikes, indicating a certain future action."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it uses phrases like "there was agreement" and "needed to continue", which convey a sense of determination and commitment to a specific course of action, leaving little room for doubt or uncertainty.
