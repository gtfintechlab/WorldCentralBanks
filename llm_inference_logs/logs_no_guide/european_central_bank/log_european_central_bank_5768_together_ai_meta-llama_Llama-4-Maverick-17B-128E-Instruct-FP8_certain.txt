A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "it was remarked that monetary transmission through the banking sector had been effective, partly because the balance sheets of banks had been stronger at the start of the pandemic than before the financial crisis of 2008."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence reports a past observation or statement regarding the effectiveness of monetary transmission. It does not express doubt or uncertainty about the fact that was remarked upon. The statement is presented as a factual observation or a past remark without hedging.

2. **Justification**: The sentence is structured as a statement of fact or a report of
2025-04-14 23:21:34,131 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "since the governing council’s monetary policy meeting in july, risk-free interest rates had declined, partly in anticipation of additional monetary policy stimulus but also in response to a worsening macroeconomic outlook."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence reports on past events and their causes with a mix of factual information and analysis of market anticipations and responses. It does not express a clear future uncertainty directly related to the ECB's actions or outcomes but discusses factors that influenced past changes in interest rates.

The sentence is: "relative to the outlook in september 2023, the projected timely return of inflation to target had been reconfirmed in the december, march and june staff projections."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence is stating a fact about the ECB's projections without expressing doubt or ambiguity about the information. It reports on the reconfirmation of a projection across multiple instances (December, March, and June staff projections), indicating a level of certainty or confirmation.

2. **Justification**: The sentence is classified as "certain" because it reports on past

The sentence is: "in this context it was pointed out that, in some countries, real estate transactions had already started to pick up again, presumably owing to reduced uncertainty about the future interest rate path."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence contains the word "presumably," which indicates a degree of uncertainty or speculation about the reason behind the observed phenomenon (real estate transactions picking up again). Additionally, it mentions "reduced uncertainty about the future interest rate path," which directly relates to uncertainty. However, the primary classification depends on the overall tone and the main

The sentence is: "in the united states, marked-based inflation expectations had also declined more recently."

First, we should correct a minor typo: "marked-based" should likely be "market-based."

Now, analyzing the sentence:

1. **Content Analysis**: The sentence discusses a specific economic indicator (inflation expectations) in a particular context (the United States). It mentions that this indicator "had also declined more recently," which is a statement about a past observation or trend.

2. **Certainty Analysis**: The sentence is stating a fact or observation about the past.

The sentence is: "for the second option the two parameter changes would be sufficient and could offer more room for manoeuvre, while minimising departures from the capital key."

This sentence discusses a hypothetical scenario ("for the second option") and uses conditional language ("would be sufficient", "could offer"), indicating a discussion of possibilities rather than stating facts or certainties.

Given this analysis, the classification should reflect the conditional nature of the statement.

The sentence is: "one of the reasons why domestic inflation had started to stabilise recently, in spite of the continued rapid increase in wages, might be that firms were moderating their markups."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence contains the word "might," which is a modal verb often used to express possibility or uncertainty. This indicates that the statement is not presenting a fact but rather a potential explanation or hypothesis.

2. **Justification**: The use of "might be" in the sentence introduces uncertainty regarding the actual reason for the stabilization of domestic inflation.

Therefore

The sentence is: "at the same time, while the difficulty of relying on precise values of these rates was acknowledged, there was agreement that, looking ahead, the governing council needed to continue removing accommodation with further interest rate hikes."

First, we observe that the sentence discusses a future action ("further interest rate hikes") that the governing council "needed to" take, indicating a decision or intention.

However, it also mentions "the difficulty of relying on precise values of these rates," which introduces an element of uncertainty regarding the specifics or the exact nature of the rates being discussed.

The sentence discusses the European Central Bank's perspective on recent data and its implications for the economic outlook. It mentions that while certain underlying forces (like solid wage growth and rising cost pressures) are seen as intact and in line with the baseline scenario, there is significant uncertainty around the duration of the economic slowdown and its impact on the medium-term inflation outlook.

Given this context, the sentence leans towards expressing uncertainty due to the mention of "the uncertainty around the projected duration of the economic slowdown remained high."

Therefore, the classification should reflect this uncertainty.

The sentence is: "the situation therefore had to be monitored closely and everything possible should be done in all policy domains to ensure that permanent damage was contained."

This sentence implies a need for action due to a potentially risky or unstable situation, indicating a level of uncertainty about the outcomes or the future state.

Breaking down the task:

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence suggests that there is a level of uncertainty or risk associated with the situation being discussed. Phrases like "had to be monitored closely" and "to ensure that permanent damage was contained" indicate a cautious or precaution
