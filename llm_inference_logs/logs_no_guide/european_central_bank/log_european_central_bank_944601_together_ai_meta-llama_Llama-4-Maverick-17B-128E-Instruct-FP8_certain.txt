A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "it would therefore be beneficial to explain that the analysis of underlying inflation pressures took a wide range of indicators into account and went well beyond core inflation."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence is suggesting a beneficial action ("it would therefore be beneficial to explain") rather than stating a fact or a certain outcome. The use of "would be beneficial" indicates a conditional or suggestive tone rather than a definitive or assertive one.

2. **Justification**: The sentence is classified as "uncertain" because it expresses a suggestion or a conditional statement rather
2025-04-14 23:32:06,758 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, we need to analyze its content and tone to determine whether it reflects certainty or uncertainty regarding the European Central Bank's monetary policy meeting.

The sentence provided is: "members concurred that euro area banks had demonstrated their resilience, had high capital ratios and had become significantly more profitable over the past year."

Let's break down the task:

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence is stating a fact or an agreement among members about the condition of euro area banks. The key verb here is "concurred," which indicates agreement, and the statement that follows describes a specific, factual condition of euro area banks.

2.
2025-04-14 23:32:06,758 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "this could, in part, be attributed to the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets, which was still incomplete, as evidenced by the high level of non-performing loans in some countries where a clear turnaround could not yet be discerned."

The language used in the sentence includes phrases such as "could, in part, be attributed" and "could not yet be discerned," which indicate a level of uncertainty or speculation about the situation being described.

Given this analysis, the classification should reflect the uncertain nature of the statement.

Here's the

The sentence is: "according to a purely mechanical update of the latest short-term inflation projections, in the near term inflation was expected to be higher than projected in december and would likely remain above 2% for the rest of the year."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence contains phrases like "was expected" and "would likely remain," which indicate a degree of uncertainty or prediction rather than a statement of fact.

2. **Justification**: The use of "expected" and "likely" in the sentence introduces uncertainty, as they refer to future projections rather

The sentence is: "recent monetary policy decisions by the governing council had improved broad financing conditions, which should support the outlook for consumption and investment."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence is discussing the outcome of monetary policy decisions and their expected impact. The key phrase here is "should support," which indicates a degree of expectation rather than certainty.

2. **Justification**: Although the sentence states that certain conditions "had improved," which is a factual and certain statement, the overall impact on the "outlook for consumption and investment" is qualified by "should support," introducing

The sentence states: "raising policy rates to sufficiently restrictive levels and keeping them there would, over time, reduce inflation by dampening demand and would also guard against the risk of a persistent upward shift in inflation expectations."

This sentence is discussing a future outcome based on a specific action (raising policy rates). The use of "would" indicates a conditional or projected outcome rather than a statement of fact. However, the tone is assertive regarding the expected effects of the action described.
