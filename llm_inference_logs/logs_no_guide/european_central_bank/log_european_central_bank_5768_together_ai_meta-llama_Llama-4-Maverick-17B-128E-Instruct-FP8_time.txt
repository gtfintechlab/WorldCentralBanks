A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "it was remarked that monetary transmission through the banking sector had been effective, partly because the balance sheets of banks had been stronger at the start of the pandemic than before the financial crisis of 2008."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence is discussing a past observation regarding the effectiveness of monetary transmission and comparing the state of banks' balance sheets at two past points (the start of the pandemic and before the 2008 financial crisis). It does not directly imply future actions or expectations.

2. **Justification**: The sentence is focused on a historical
2025-04-14 23:22:34,741 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and context.

The sentence is: "since the governing council’s monetary policy meeting in july, risk-free interest rates had declined, partly in anticipation of additional monetary policy stimulus but also in response to a worsening macroeconomic outlook."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence mentions "in anticipation of additional monetary policy stimulus," which indicates expectations or predictions about future actions or events. This suggests that the sentence is looking forward to potential future developments.

2. **Justification**: The presence of phrases like "in anticipation of additional monetary policy stimulus" indicates that the sentence is discussing future expectations or potential
2025-04-14 23:22:34,741 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and context.

The sentence is: "relative to the outlook in september 2023, the projected timely return of inflation to target had been reconfirmed in the december, march and june staff projections."

1. **Understanding the task**: We need to determine if the sentence is "forward looking" or "not forward looking" in the context of the European Central Bank's (ECB) monetary policy meeting. "Forward looking" statements typically refer to future expectations, projections, or guidance.

2. **Analyzing the sentence**: The sentence discusses the "projected timely return of
2025-04-14 23:22:34,741 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and context.

The sentence is: "in this context it was pointed out that, in some countries, real estate transactions had already started to pick up again, presumably owing to reduced uncertainty about the future interest rate path."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence is discussing the impact of reduced uncertainty about future interest rates on current real estate transactions. This implies that the sentence is referencing expectations or outlooks on future monetary policy or economic conditions.

2. **Justification**: The mention of "future interest rate path" directly indicates that the sentence is looking ahead, referencing future conditions or expectations.

The sentence is: "in the united states, marked-based inflation expectations had also declined more recently."

1. **Understanding the task**: We need to determine if the sentence is "forward looking" or "not forward looking" in the context of the European Central Bank's monetary policy meeting.

2. **Analyzing the sentence**: The sentence discusses "inflation expectations," which inherently involves future outlooks or predictions since expectations are about what is anticipated to happen.

3. **Determining the label**:

The sentence is: "if lower energy prices or other factors reduced the cost of living now, this should put downward pressure on wage claims next year."

1. **Understanding the task**: We need to determine if the sentence is "forward looking" or "not forward looking" based on its content and the context of the European Central Bank's monetary policy meeting.

2. **Analyzing the sentence**: The sentence discusses the potential impact of current changes (lower energy prices or other factors reducing the cost of living) on future outcomes (wage claims next year). The key elements
2025-04-14 23:22:36,598 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, "credit conditions for households and firms remained accommodative," we need to analyze its content and determine whether it looks towards future actions or outcomes or simply reports on the current or past state.

The sentence is stating a fact about the current or past state of credit conditions without directly indicating any future actions or expectations regarding the European Central Bank's monetary policy.

Given this, the classification should be based on whether the statement implies future conditions or actions.

Here is the classification:

{

The sentence is: "such a risk was considered as increasingly likely to materialise since hicp inflation was projected to stand above, and mostly far above, 2% for more than three years."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence refers to a projection about future inflation rates ("was projected to stand above... for more than three years"), indicating it discusses expectations or forecasts about future economic conditions.

2. **Justification**: The sentence is considered forward-looking because it mentions a projection about future inflation rates, indicating an expectation or forecast about future economic conditions.

The sentence is: "at the same time, it was also argued that downside risks related to the euro area domestic economy and political risks had diminished markedly."

First, we need to understand what "forward looking" means in the context of monetary policy discussions. Forward-looking statements typically refer to future expectations, predictions, or guidance related to economic conditions, policy decisions, or their outcomes.

The given sentence discusses "downside risks" and their change, which inherently involves some level of future perspective since risks are about potential future outcomes. It mentions that these risks "had diminished markedly,"

The sentence is: "taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, upon a proposal by the president, the governing council confirmed the decisions taken at its monetary policy meeting last december and as set out in the dedicated press release published after the meeting."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence refers to confirming decisions taken at a previous meeting ("last December") and does not explicitly mention or imply future actions or decisions beyond what was previously decided or communicated.
