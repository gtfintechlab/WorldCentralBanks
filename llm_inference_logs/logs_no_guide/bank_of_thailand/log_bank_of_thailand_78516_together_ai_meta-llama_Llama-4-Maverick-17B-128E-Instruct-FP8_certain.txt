A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "looking ahead, the global financial markets would remain highly volatile."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence is discussing a future condition ("looking ahead") and uses the word "would," which is a conditional verb form often used to express uncertainty or a hypothetical situation. This indicates that the statement is not a definitive prediction but rather an expectation or forecast based on current conditions or trends.

2. **Justification**: The use of "would remain" suggests a conditional or predicted state rather than a statement of fact, indicating uncertainty about the future
2025-04-14 15:02:50,633 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "financial stability remained sound overall but there remained a need to monitor some pockets of risks that might pose vulnerabilities to financial stability in the future."

This sentence contains a mix of a definitive statement ("financial stability remained sound overall") and a cautionary note about potential future risks ("some pockets of risks that might pose vulnerabilities"). The presence of "might pose" indicates uncertainty about future events.

Given this analysis, the classification should reflect the uncertainty expressed regarding future risks.

Here's the output following the required structure:

The sentence provided is: "among these workers, around 1.2 million could become unemployed or underemployed."

Let's analyze it:

1. **Label Assignment**: The key to determining the label lies in understanding the nature of the statement. The sentence uses the word "could," which is a modal verb often used to express possibility or potential.

2. **Analysis**: The use of "could" indicates that the statement is not definitive but rather speculative or predictive,
2025-04-14 15:02:50,633 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, we need to analyze its content and tone to determine if it expresses a certain or uncertain view regarding Japan's economic recovery.

The sentence is: "looking ahead, japan’s economy should recover slowly given lingering domestic structural constraints."

Here's the step-by-step thought process:
1. The sentence is making a prediction about Japan's economy.
2. It uses the word "should," which indicates a degree of expectation rather than a definitive statement.
3. The phrase "given lingering domestic structural constraints" suggests that there are underlying conditions affecting the prediction, implying some level of uncertainty or conditionality.

Based on these observations, the

The sentence states: "regarding financial market conditions in thailand, commercial bank lending rates and government bond yields remained low, whereas corporate bond spreads were still high."

This sentence is reporting factual information about the current state of financial market conditions in Thailand, specifically mentioning the status of commercial bank lending rates, government bond yields, and corporate bond spreads. The language used is descriptive and does not express doubt or ambiguity about the facts being reported.

Therefore, the classification should be based on the certainty of the information being conveyed.

The sentence is: "this would address the debt overhang problem in a targeted and practical manner, lowering risk to economic growth in the medium term."

First, we observe the use of the conditional verb "would," which often indicates a hypothetical or uncertain situation rather than a statement of fact. This suggests that the outcome described is not presented as a certainty but rather as a potential result of some action or decision.

Given this observation, we can classify the sentence.

Here is the classification:

{
"label": "uncertain",

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence discusses "market expectations" regarding future actions (policy rate increases), which indicates a prediction or anticipation rather than a certainty.

2. **Justification**: The use of "expectations" and reference to "future" actions implies uncertainty because it deals with anticipated events rather than confirmed or past actions.

2025-04-14 15:03:18,958 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "looking ahead, headline inflation was expected to gradually trend up toward target on account of domestic demand recovery and higher oil prices than in the previous year."

This sentence contains the word "expected," which is a key indicator of uncertainty because it refers to a future event or condition that is anticipated but not guaranteed.

Therefore, the classification is as follows:

The decision on these increases will be based on the economic and inflation outlook.

To determine if the sentence is certain or uncertain, we need to look at the language used:

The sentence is: "the thai economy would expand at a lower rate than previous projection and further below its potential due to the contraction in merchandise exports that increasingly affected the labor market."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence discusses a future economic condition with a conditional projection ("would expand at a lower rate"), indicating a level of uncertainty or prediction rather than a statement of fact.

2. **Justification**: The use of "would expand" and comparison to "previous projection" suggests a forecast or prediction, which inherently carries uncertainty.

Therefore, the output should be:

2025-04-14 15:03:31,546 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, "public expenditure would expand more than assessed," we need to analyze its language and tone.

The sentence is discussing a future event (public expenditure expanding) in a conditional or predictive manner ("would expand"). The use of "would" indicates a hypothetical or uncertain situation rather than a statement of fact.

Therefore, the classification is as follows:

The sentence is: "advanced economies were expected to expand mainly on the back of private consumption as employment and consumer confidence continued to improve."

Let's break it down:

1. The phrase "were expected to expand" indicates a prediction or anticipation rather than a statement of fact. This suggests that the expansion is not presented as a certainty but rather as something anticipated or forecasted.

2. The reason given for this expected expansion is "private consumption as employment and consumer confidence continued to improve." The use of "

The sentence discusses the moderation of the Chinese economy due to certain factors but also mentions expectations for future growth driven by various positive factors such as high employment, favourable income conditions, and government support. The key phrases to focus on are "should be an important driver of growth" and the overall context of future projections.

Given that the sentence includes a projection ("should be an important driver of growth going forward"), it implies a level of uncertainty because it is discussing future expectations rather than stating facts.

Here's the classification based on the analysis:

The sentence is: "asian economies would gain further traction on account of domestic demand that was partly driven by the public sector."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence uses the conditional verb "would gain," which typically indicates a hypothetical or predicted situation rather than a statement of fact. This suggests that the sentence is expressing uncertainty or a conditional outcome rather than a certainty.

2. **Justification**: The use of "would gain" indicates a future conditional scenario, making the statement uncertain as it depends on certain conditions being met.
