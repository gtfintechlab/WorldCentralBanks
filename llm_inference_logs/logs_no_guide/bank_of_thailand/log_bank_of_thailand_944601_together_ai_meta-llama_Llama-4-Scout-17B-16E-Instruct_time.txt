A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions future actions the MPC will take in response to evolving developments, indicating a forward-looking perspective."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "forward looking" because it discusses future actions and monitoring of developments, implying a focus on what will happen or might happen in the future.
2025-04-14 15:07:11,606 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence is forward looking because it mentions potential future risks and the need for close monitoring 'going forward'."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "forward looking" because it discusses potential future risks and uncertainties, specifically the impact of declines in global oil prices and US trade policies, and the need to monitor them in the future.
2025-04-14 15:07:11,606 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses past or current actions taken by the People's Bank of China, rather than expressing future intentions or projections."
}
```

Note that the sentence mentions "additional measures" which could imply a forward-looking aspect, but the overall context and verb tense used ("concurrently") suggest that the sentence is describing actions that are being taken or have been taken, rather than outlining future plans.

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",

I chose "not forward looking" because the sentence refers to impacts that "would be" more pronounced, but the context suggests that these impacts are being discussed in relation to a past or current situation, rather than a future one. However, upon re-reading, I realize that "would be" can indicate a future conditional. 

A more accurate classification would be:

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses future inflation projections for specific quarters, indicating a forward-looking perspective."
}
```

This classification is based on the presence of future time references ("in the second and third quarters") and predictive language ("inflation could exceed"), which indicate that the sentence is looking ahead to future events rather than discussing past or current situations.
2025-04-14 15:07:13,135 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence describes the current state of global financial conditions and bond yields, without making any predictions or references to future events or expectations."

This sentence is classified as "not forward looking" because it only discusses the current situation, using phrases such as "remained accommodative", "were still lower", and "despite some spike", which indicate a focus on past or present conditions rather than future prospects.
