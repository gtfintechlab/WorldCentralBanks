A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "moreover, although domestic inflation remained high, short-run inflationary pressures from the government’s stimulus package may not be material given the implementation time lag and only a small disbursement was expected in the second half of the year."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence contains the phrase "may not be material," which indicates a level of uncertainty regarding the impact of the government's stimulus package on short-run inflationary pressures.

2. **Justification**: The use of "may not be material" introduces uncertainty about the effect of the stimulus package,

The sentence is: "at the same time, the committee also discussed the room to reduce the policy rate further (policy space), as going forward, there remained uncertainties in both the internal and external environment."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence discusses the committee's consideration of future actions (reducing the policy rate) and mentions "uncertainties in both the internal and external environment." The presence of uncertainties directly impacts the certainty of the statement regarding future actions or outcomes.

The sentence is: "thus, there was a need to monitor rollover risks especially for non-investment grade or unrated bonds."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence implies a necessity or a recommendation based on a specific condition or assessment, which is related to monitoring rollover risks. The use of "there was a need" indicates a conclusion drawn from a certain situation or analysis, but it doesn't directly express uncertainty about the situation itself. However, the context is about a risk that needs to be monitored, suggesting a level of caution or precaution rather than a statement of
2025-04-14 14:48:00,245 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "nevertheless, credit assistance measures partially relieved liquidity constraints of businesses and households affected by the covid-19 pandemic."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence is stating a fact or an outcome regarding the effect of credit assistance measures. The key words here are "partially relieved," which indicates a specific, observed effect rather than a speculative or uncertain one.

2. **Justification**: The sentence is classified based on its assertion of a factual outcome related to the effect of certain measures, indicating a level of certainty about what happened.

3. **Output**:
2025-04-14 14:48:00,245 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence lists specific factors that have influenced the situation, including a surplus in the services balance, a surplus in the trade balance, and the low level of domestic investment, attributing these to concrete events or conditions like the Chinese government's policy and a fall in oil prices.

Given that the sentence reports on these factors in a factual manner without expressing doubt or speculation about them, it suggests a level of certainty.

Here's the classification based on the analysis:

```

The sentence is: "inflation thus was not an immediate threat; (3) risks to financial stability decreased somewhat, reflected by decelerating private credit growth amid economic slowdown."

First, we observe that the sentence contains phrases that indicate a level of assessment or judgment rather than absolute facts. The phrase "was not an immediate threat" suggests an evaluation of a situation. The use of "somewhat" to describe the decrease in risks to financial stability introduces a degree of imprecision, indicating that the decrease is not sharply defined.

The sentence is: "mpc members discussed the development of key factors affecting the economic recovery."

1. **Understanding the Sentence**: The sentence refers to a discussion by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members about factors influencing economic recovery. It does not directly state a decision, outcome, or a definitive stance on the economic recovery or monetary policy.

2. **Analyzing Certainty**: 
   - A "certain" classification would typically involve a statement that is definitive, decided, or factual without ambiguity.
   - An "uncertain" classification involves a statement that implies doubt

The sentence is: "moreover, investors would search for higher yields across almost all asset classes, which could lead to underpricing of risks."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence contains the word "could," which is a conditional verb indicating possibility rather than certainty. This suggests that the outcome described is not definite but rather potential.

2. **Justification**: The use of "would" and "could" in the sentence indicates a hypothetical or conditional scenario, suggesting uncertainty about the outcome.

Given these observations, the classification should reflect that the sentence expresses uncertainty.

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence discusses "market expectations" regarding future actions (policy rate increases), which indicates a prediction or anticipation rather than a certainty.

2. **Justification**: The use of "expectations" and reference to future events ("future policy rate increases") introduces uncertainty because it deals with anticipated rather than confirmed actions.
