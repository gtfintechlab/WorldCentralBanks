A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses a potential future effect of lowering interest rates on household behavior, indicating a forward-looking perspective."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "forward looking" because it analyzes a possible future consequence of a policy action (lowering interest rates) on the behavior of medium- to high-income households, specifically their investment decisions. This type of analysis is typical of forward-looking statements, which consider the potential effects of a decision or action on future outcomes.

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence primarily discusses past or current conditions and their impacts, without expressing future predictions or projections."
}
