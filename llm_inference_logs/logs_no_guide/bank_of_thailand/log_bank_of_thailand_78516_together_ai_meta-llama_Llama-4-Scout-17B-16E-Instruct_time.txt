A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses future economic growth projections for 2024 and 2025, indicating a forward-looking perspective."

```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence specifically mentions future years (2024 and 2025) and provides projections for those periods, which is a clear indication of a forward-looking statement.
2025-04-14 14:59:21,315 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a future-oriented consideration of potential implications, indicating a forward-looking perspective."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence mentions "closely monitor the potential implications" which suggests a consideration of future events or outcomes, making it forward looking.

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses past or current impacts, rather than making predictions or statements about future economic conditions or policy actions."
}
```

I chose "not forward looking" because the sentence refers to impacts that "would be" more pronounced, but the context suggests that these impacts are being discussed in relation to a past or current situation, rather than a future one. However, upon re-reading, I realize that "would be" can indicate a future conditional. 

A more accurate classification would be:
