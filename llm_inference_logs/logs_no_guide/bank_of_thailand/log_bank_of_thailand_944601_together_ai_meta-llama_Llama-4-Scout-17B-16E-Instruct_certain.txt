A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words and phrases that indicate a predicted or expected outcome, rather than a stated fact, such as 'expected to be robust' and 'after the formation of a new government'."
}
```

This classification is based on the presence of words and phrases that indicate uncertainty or prediction, such as "expected to be", "trend", "continued", and "after the formation of a new government". These words and phrases suggest that the outcome is not certain, but rather a prediction or expectation based on current trends and conditions.
2025-04-14 15:06:10,216 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses uncertainty about future economic trends, using phrases such as 'risks to inflation have increased' and 'recovery had become more evident', which imply a degree of unpredictability."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it discusses risks and trends that may or may not continue, and uses language that implies a degree of unpredictability.
2025-04-14 15:06:10,216 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a historical fact about economic growth, using the past tense and specific indicators, implying a level of certainty."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "certain" because it describes a past situation with specific data (exports, manufacturing production, and increased consumer confidence) that support the claim of sustained growth, suggesting that the information is presented as factual rather than speculative or uncertain.
2025-04-14 15:06:10,216 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a definitive statement about the limitations of monetary policy in addressing certain issues, using phrases such as 'cannot be addressed solely' that indicate a high degree of certainty."
}
```

The sentence is classified as "certain" because it presents a clear and definitive statement about the root cause of issues and the limitations of monetary policy, without expressing any doubt or uncertainty.
2025-04-14 15:06:10,216 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a historical event that has already occurred, indicating a certain outcome."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "certain" because it reports on a past event that has already happened, specifically the initial depreciation of the baht after a policy interest rate cut and the announcement of the relaxation of foreign exchange regulations. The use of the past tense ("depreciated") and the specific reference to a particular event imply a level of certainty about what occurred.

```
{

}
```

Note that the sentence seems to be referring to the People's Bank of China, not the Bank of Thailand, but I will focus on the task of classifying the sentence as certain or uncertain. 

The sentence's phrasing suggests that the measures are being considered or might be taken, rather than being definitively implemented, which indicates uncertainty.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'small impact' and 'given government measures', which imply a degree of uncertainty or variability in the effect of the rise in oil prices on consumption."

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it contains phrases that suggest a degree of uncertainty or nuance in the relationship between the rise in oil prices and consumption. The use of "small impact" and "given government measures" implies that the effect is not fixed or guaranteed, but rather dependent on various factors.

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it states a factual observation about the past, without using words or phrases that indicate uncertainty, such as "may", "could", "likely", or "it is expected that". The sentence provides specific details about the issuances of unrated bonds in the fourth quarter of 2017, which suggests a tone of factual reporting rather than speculative or uncertain language.

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents information in a factual and descriptive way, without using words or phrases that indicate uncertainty, such as "may", "could", "likely", or "it is possible that". The sentence simply reports on the state of foreign currency liquidity and market adjustment during a specific period, without expressing any doubt about the accuracy of the information.

{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses uncertainty due to the presence of words like 'might affect', indicating a potential but not guaranteed impact."

  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'should' and 'moderate recovery', which indicate a degree of uncertainty or prediction rather than a statement of fact."

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it expresses a prediction or expectation about future events (exports of goods improving) rather than stating a fact. The use of "should" and "moderate recovery" also implies a degree of uncertainty or conditionality.

{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence is stated as a fact without any ambiguity or expression of doubt, indicating a certain classification."

```

The sentence "global inflationary pressure generally remained subdued" is a statement of fact and does not contain any words or phrases that suggest uncertainty, such as "it is likely that", "may", or "could". The use of "generally" suggests a generalization based on available information, but it does not imply uncertainty. Therefore, I classify the sentence as certain.

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it describes a specific situation where commercial banks were reluctant to lower their interest rates due to a given high level of competition in both credit and deposit markets, implying a definite outcome. There is no ambiguity or uncertainty expressed in the sentence.

2025-04-14 15:06:46,912 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence: "unemployed workers could take a long time to re-enter the labor force," I would analyze it based on the presence of uncertainty indicators such as modal verbs (e.g., could, may, might), conditional tenses, or other expressions that suggest doubt or variability in outcomes.

Given sentence: "unemployed workers could take a long time to re-enter the labor force."

- The sentence contains the modal verb "could," which indicates possibility rather than certainty.
- This suggests that the sentence is discussing a potential scenario rather than a guaranteed or factual one.

Therefore, the classification would be:

```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents specific consequences that have already happened, without any ambiguous language or expressions of doubt. The use of phrases like "this resulted in" and "compared with" suggests a factual report of events, which supports the classification as certain.

This sentence reports a historical event (the decline in government bond yields) and attributes it to specific, factual reasons (higher demand from domestic institutional investors and lower expected issuance of government bonds). The language used is descriptive and assertive, without any hedging or uncertainty, which supports the classification as "certain".

{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence presents a projection as a factual statement without expressing doubt or ambiguity."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents a projection as a factual statement, using phrases like "was projected to register" and specific numbers ("1.2 billion us dollars"), which implies a level of confidence and certainty about the prediction.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses uncertainty due to the presence of phrases such as 'pockets of risks that warranted monitoring', indicating potential future developments that are not yet clear."
}
```

This classification is based on the analysis that the sentence contains phrases that imply uncertainty or potential risks, which suggests that the outcome or situation is not entirely clear or predictable. The use of "remained pockets of risks" and "warranted monitoring" implies that there are potential issues that need to be watched, which introduces an element of uncertainty.
