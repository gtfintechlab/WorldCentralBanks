A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

2025-04-14 15:08:05,037 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence according to the Bank of Thailand's monetary policy stance, let's analyze its content.

The sentence mentions that demand is expected to be robust due to several factors, including an upward trend in purchase orders, expansion in private investment, favorable credit conditions, and increased fiscal spending. These factors suggest a positive outlook on economic growth.

Given this context, we can infer that the Bank of Thailand is likely to maintain or adopt a stance that is not overly accommodative or is preparing for potential future inflationary pressures due to robust demand. However, the sentence does not directly indicate a tightening of monetary policy; instead, it highlights positive economic
2025-04-14 15:08:05,037 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence regarding the Bank of Thailand's monetary policy meeting, let's analyze its content.

The sentence mentions that "risks to inflation have increased" which could be seen as a reason for concern that might lead to a more hawkish stance due to the potential need to control inflation. However, it also notes that "the global economy maintained its recovery momentum," which is generally a positive sign but doesn't directly indicate a specific monetary policy stance. The key phrase here is "risks to inflation have increased," as it suggests a potential future issue that might require a tightening of monetary policy to mitigate.

Given this, the output should
2025-04-14 15:08:05,037 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence according to the Bank of Thailand's monetary policy stance, let's analyze it step by step.

1. **Understanding the sentence**: The sentence mentions that China and Asian economies are showing sustained growth, driven by exports, manufacturing production, and increased consumer confidence.

2. **Relating the sentence to monetary policy stance**:
   - A "hawkish" stance typically implies a focus on inflation control, suggesting potential interest rate hikes to curb inflationary pressures that might arise from a growing economy.
   - A "dovish" stance implies a focus on stimulating economic growth, possibly through lowering interest rates or maintaining accommodative monetary
2025-04-14 15:08:05,037 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence according to the Bank of Thailand's monetary policy stance, let's analyze its content and implications.

The sentence states: "however, the root cause of such issues stemmed from borrowers’ credit risks and lenders’ limitations in assessing the risks of smaller firms, all of which cannot be addressed solely through monetary policy."

1. **Understanding the sentence**: The sentence discusses the root causes of certain financial issues, attributing them to credit risks and lenders' risk assessment limitations, rather than monetary policy. It implies that monetary policy has its limitations in addressing these issues.

2. **Analyzing the implications for monetary policy stance**:
2025-04-14 15:08:05,037 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence according to the Bank of Thailand's monetary policy stance, let's analyze it step by step.

1. **Understanding the sentence**: The sentence mentions a "policy interest rate cut" and the "relaxation of foreign exchange regulations," followed by the initial depreciation of the baht.

2. **Identifying key elements**:
   - "Policy interest rate cut" is a dovish monetary policy action as it involves lowering interest rates to stimulate the economy.
   - "Relaxation of foreign exchange regulations" can also be seen as an easing measure, as it potentially makes it easier for capital to flow in or out, which
