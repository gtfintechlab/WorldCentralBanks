A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

2025-04-14 15:09:19,117 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence discusses future expectations regarding demand, citing several factors that are anticipated to contribute to its robustness. The key phrases to focus on are "was expected to be" and the list of factors that are expected to support demand. The use of "was expected to be" indicates a future projection based on certain conditions or trends.

Given this, the sentence is discussing future events or conditions that have not yet occurred but are anticipated based on current trends or factors. The language used ("was expected to be") suggests a level of prediction or forecast rather than a statement of fact.

Therefore

The sentence is: "inflation could exceed 5 percent in the second and third quarters, mainly attributed to the low-base effect of crude oil prices and government assistance measures in 2021."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence contains the word "could," which is a modal verb often used to express possibility or potentiality rather than certainty. This indicates that the statement is not definitive but rather speculative or predictive with some degree of uncertainty.

2. **Justification**: The use of "could exceed" suggests a possibility rather than a definitive outcome, indicating uncertainty.

Therefore

The sentence discusses the potential effects of certain economic measures on inflation figures and expectations. It mentions that some measures "may slow the rise in measured inflation figures" and that other factors "will likely add to inflationary pressure and may heighten inflation expectations." The use of words and phrases such as "may," "likely," and "may heighten" indicates a level of uncertainty or prediction about future outcomes rather than stating facts or certainties.

The sentence is: "the committee would also monitor the effectiveness of the relaxation of foreign exchange regulations to encourage capital outflows and consider implementing additional measures if necessary."

This sentence implies future actions that are conditional or dependent on certain outcomes ("if necessary"), indicating a level of uncertainty regarding whether these actions will be taken.

Given this, the classification should be "uncertain" because the sentence does not assert a definitive action or outcome but rather a potential future action contingent on certain conditions.

The sentence is: "global financial conditions remained accommodative as overall government bond yields were still lower than historical averages despite some spike during market correction."

This sentence reports on a past state of global financial conditions and government bond yields, providing a factual account without expressing a clear future prediction or ambiguity that would introduce uncertainty.

Here's the step-by-step thought process:
1. The sentence is stating a fact about the past ("remained accommodative", "were still lower"), which suggests a level of certainty because it's describing something that has already occurred.

The sentence is: "meanwhile, flood-related shortages could push prices of some goods up temporarily."

Let's break it down:

1. The word "could" is a key indicator of uncertainty because it expresses possibility rather than certainty.
2. The phrase "push prices of some goods up temporarily" suggests a potential outcome that may or may not happen, further indicating uncertainty.

Given these observations, the sentence is expressing a potential or possible outcome rather than stating a fact or a certain event.

2025-04-14 15:09:48,376 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and structure.

The sentence lists several factors that include "uncertainties regarding trade negotiations," "geopolitical risks," "the potential slowdown of global and Thai economies," and "the monetary policy outlook of advanced economies." The presence of words and phrases like "uncertainties," "risks," and "potential slowdown" indicates a discussion about future events or conditions that are not guaranteed or certain.

Given this analysis, the classification should reflect the inherent uncertainty in the factors being discussed.

Here's the output following the required structure:

2025-04-14 15:09:48,376 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "the 2024 growth projection inclusive of the government’s digital wallet scheme was 3.8 percent, relative to the previous assessment of 4.4 percent."

This sentence reports on a specific, factual comparison between two growth projections. It does not contain speculative language, conditionals, or expressions of doubt that are typically associated with uncertainty.

Therefore, the classification is as follows:

The sentence is: "the baht fluctuated against the us dollar, initially depreciating due to weak chinese economic outturns before appreciating in line with regional currencies amid expectations of slower tightening in us monetary policy."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence describes past events ("the baht fluctuated", "initially depreciating", "before appreciating") and mentions "expectations" regarding future US monetary policy. The use of "expectations" indicates a degree of uncertainty because it refers to future events or outcomes that are not certain.

The sentence states: "the nominal effective exchange rate (neer) index appreciated due to thailand’s strong external stability, which was partly reflected by the sustained current account surplus."

This sentence is making a factual statement about the appreciation of the nominal effective exchange rate index and attributes this appreciation to Thailand's strong external stability, as evidenced by a sustained current account surplus. The language used is assertive and does not contain any hedging or speculative terms that would indicate uncertainty.

Therefore, the classification is as follows:

The sentence is: "this, however, might not lead to additional investment in the near term, as spare production capacity should remain in many industries."

1. The sentence contains the word "might," which is a modal verb often used to express possibility or uncertainty.
2. The phrase "should remain" also indicates a degree of uncertainty or prediction about the future state.

Given these observations, the sentence is expressing a view about a potential future outcome with some level of doubt or uncertainty.

Therefore, the classification is:

The sentence is: "the committee would closely monitor the risks arising from corporate bonds especially those issued by businesses severely affected by the covid-19, which could be downgraded to non-investment grade."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence contains the phrase "could be downgraded," which indicates a possibility rather than a certainty. This suggests that the outcome is not definite, leaning towards uncertainty.

2. **Justification**: The use of "could be downgraded" implies a potential future event that is not guaranteed, indicating uncertainty.

The sentence provided is: "short-term measures to accelerate the procurement and distribution of appropriate vaccines would prevent the outbreak from being prolonged and reduce economic costs."

Let's break down the task:

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence is discussing a hypothetical or conditional outcome ("would prevent") related to implementing short-term measures for vaccine procurement and distribution. The use of "would" indicates a conditional or potential outcome rather than a statement of fact.

2. **Justification**: The sentence
2025-04-14 15:10:08,897 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "public expenditure would grow at a slower pace than previously assessed partly because of budget disbursement constraints as well as the expected delay in the enactment of the annual budget expenditure act, b.e."

First, we observe the use of the word "would," which is a conditional verb form often used to express future possibilities or predictions based on certain conditions. The phrase "expected delay" also indicates a future uncertainty.

Given these observations, the sentence is discussing a future scenario with conditions and expectations, rather than stating a fact or a certain outcome.
