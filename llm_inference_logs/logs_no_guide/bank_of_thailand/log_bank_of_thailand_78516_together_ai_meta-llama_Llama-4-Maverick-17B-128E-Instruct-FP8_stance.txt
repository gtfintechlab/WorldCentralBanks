A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

2025-04-14 15:02:19,759 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance based on the given sentence, we need to analyze the information provided and understand the implications of the actions described.

The sentence mentions that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of Thailand reduced the policy rate at the previous meeting, and as a result, money market rates and short to medium-term government bond yields decreased.

Reducing the policy rate is a monetary easing action, which typically indicates a more accommodative or dovish stance on monetary policy. This is because lowering interest rates aims to stimulate economic activity by making borrowing cheaper.

Therefore, the classification should reflect this easing action.
