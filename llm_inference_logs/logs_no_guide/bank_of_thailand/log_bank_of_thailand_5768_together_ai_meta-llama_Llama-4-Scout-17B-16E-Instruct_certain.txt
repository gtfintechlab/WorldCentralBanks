A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence presents a factual statement about the effect of credit assistance measures, using the past tense and a clear cause-and-effect relationship, indicating a certain outcome."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it describes a specific, factual outcome of the credit assistance measures, without expressing any doubt or uncertainty. The use of the word "nevertheless" indicates a contrast, but it does not imply uncertainty about the effect of the measures. The sentence presents a clear and definitive statement about the impact of the measures on liquidity constraints.

However, I can also argue that it is uncertain because it talks about the impact of covid-19 which might not be the same across different households and also the sentence uses the word "some" which implies a subset of households.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses specific factors and their effects on the economy, indicating a tone of confidence and certainty."
}
```

However, upon re-reading the sentence, I notice that there are some phrases that imply uncertainty, such as "not an immediate threat" and "exposed to economic slowdown". These phrases suggest that the outcome is not entirely predictable.

Here is the revised classification:

```

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'likely' and 'delay in some', which indicate uncertainty and ambiguity."
}
```

The presence of words like "likely" and the mention of potential delays suggest that the outcome is not guaranteed, hence the classification as "uncertain".

  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports factual information about the improvement in private investment indicators and consumption, without any expressions of doubt or ambiguity."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "certain" because it presents information in a factual and definitive manner, without using words or phrases that indicate uncertainty, such as "may", "could", "likely", or "it is expected that". The use of verbs like "improved" and "continued to expand" also suggests a sense of confidence and certainty about the state of the economy.

This classification is based on the presence of words that suggest a level of uncertainty or prediction, rather than a definitive statement. The use of "expected" and "an upward revision" implies that the numbers are forecasts or projections, rather than actual values.

{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports factual information about the past performance of merchandise exports without expressing any doubt or ambiguity."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it describes a specific situation (merchandise exports continued to contract) and provides explanations for this situation (weak demand from Asian economies, shifting global trade structure, and declining competitiveness) without using uncertain language, such as modal verbs (e.g., may, might) or hedging words (e.g., likely, possibly).

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because, despite the committee's vote being unanimous and the current state of the economy being described, the sentence includes language that implies a level of uncertainty about future economic trends, such as the prediction that exports "should pick up" and the economy "expanding toward the potential level".

The sentence expresses a prediction about the future rebound of Asian exports, which implies some level of uncertainty. The use of "should" and "expected" suggests that the outcome is not guaranteed, making the sentence uncertain rather than certain.

Although the sentence contains conditional phrases ("if and when warranted by the circumstances"), the tone is assertive and indicates a sense of preparedness, which suggests certainty about the framework and policy responses. 

Alternatively, I can also justify it in this way:

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents information in a factual and objective tone, without any expressions of doubt, ambiguity, or future prediction. The use of phrases like "gained pace", "gradual recovery", and "remaining close to the historical average rate" suggests a description of an actual state of affairs, rather than a speculative or uncertain one.

However, upon re-reading, I realize that the sentence does contain words that indicate a degree of uncertainty or comparison ("slower rate", "much further below"). But the main verb "assessed" and the phrase "the committee assessed that" indicate a statement that is presented as factual based on the committee's evaluation.

However, I can also argue that:

```

  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'near term' and 'vulnerable' that imply some degree of uncertainty or ambiguity."

Upon re-reading, I think the second classification is more suitable because "near term" and "vulnerable" do introduce some uncertainty.

So, the final output is:

The sentence is classified as "certain" because it uses a directive tone, implying that financial institutions are expected to take a specific action (continue with debt restructuring). The use of "should" indicates a strong suggestion or recommendation, which implies a certain expectation or intention.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a clear cause-and-effect relationship without any ambiguity or doubt."
}
```

However, upon re-reading, I realize that the sentence does contain words that imply a degree of subjectivity and evaluation ("more vulnerable", "modest growth outlook"). Therefore, I revise my classification as follows:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence involves subjective evaluation and prediction, making the statement uncertain."
}
```

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a predicted outcome with a degree of confidence, using the phrase 'should be more evident' which implies a level of certainty."
}
```

However, I can also argue that:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence uses the phrase 'should be' which indicates a degree of uncertainty or prediction rather than a definitive statement."
}
```

Upon reevaluating, I think the second one is more accurate.
