A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

1. **Understanding the task**: We need to determine if the sentence is "forward looking" or "not forward looking" in the context of the Bank of Thailand's monetary policy meeting.

2. **Analyzing the sentence**: The sentence discusses a past event (a resumption of capital inflows) that occurred after another past event (a general election on 5 May). It does not explicitly mention future actions or expectations related to the

The sentence is stating that bond markets "have been functioning normally," which indicates a description of their current or recent past state rather than making a statement about their future functioning or the future in general.

Therefore, the classification should be based on whether the sentence implies future expectations or outcomes.

Given this, the output should be:
