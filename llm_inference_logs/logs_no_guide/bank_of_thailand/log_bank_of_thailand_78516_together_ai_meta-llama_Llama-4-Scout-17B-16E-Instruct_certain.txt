A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

2025-04-14 14:51:47,649 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific and definitive decision made by the MPC, indicating a certain outcome."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence states a clear and specific decision ("voted 3 to 2 to maintain the policy rate at 3.0 percent per annum"), which implies a certain outcome rather than an uncertain or speculative one.
2025-04-14 14:51:47,649 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains the word 'would remain highly volatile', indicating a prediction or forecast rather than a statement of fact, which implies uncertainty."
}
```
2025-04-14 14:51:47,649 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses uncertainty due to the presence of words like 'might pose vulnerabilities' and 'need to monitor some pockets of risks', indicating potential future risks that are not yet realized."
}
```
2025-04-14 14:51:47,649 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'around' and 'could become', which indicate a degree of uncertainty or estimation."
}
```

The sentence is classified as "uncertain" because it uses words like "around" and "could become", which suggest a range of possibilities rather than a definitive outcome.
2025-04-14 14:51:47,649 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'should' and 'given lingering domestic structural constraints', which indicate a degree of uncertainty or conditionality about the future state of Japan's economy."
}

The presence of words like "likely" and "delay in some" suggests that the sentence is expressing a possibility rather than a fact, which indicates uncertainty.

The sentence reports a factual action taken by specific central banks, which implies a level of certainty about the event. There are no words or phrases that suggest uncertainty, such as "may", "could", or "it is likely that".

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses uncertainty due to the presence of words like 'might affect', indicating a potential but not guaranteed impact."
}
```

This classification is based on the analysis of the sentence, which contains phrases that suggest uncertainty or possibility rather than certainty. The word "might" is a key indicator of uncertainty, as it implies that there is a possibility of something happening, but it is not guaranteed.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates that the committee's future decisions will depend on various factors and data, implying a level of uncertainty."
}
```

This classification is based on the presence of phrases such as "data-dependent", "closely monitoring", and "associated risks", which suggest that the outcome or future actions are not fixed or guaranteed, hence uncertain.

  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words and phrases that indicate uncertainty, such as 'expected', 'would soften somewhat', 'might affect', and 'in particular', which suggest a degree of doubt or unpredictability."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it contains several words and phrases that indicate a degree of uncertainty or doubt, such as "expected", "would soften somewhat", "might affect", and "in particular". These words and phrases suggest that the outcome is not guaranteed and that there are various factors that could influence the result

  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a past event with specific factors, indicating a factual report rather than a speculative or uncertain statement."
}
```

This sentence reports a historical event (the decline in government bond yields) and attributes it to specific, factual reasons (higher demand from domestic institutional investors and lower expected issuance of government bonds). The language used is descriptive and assertive, without any hedging or uncertainty, which supports the classification as "certain".
