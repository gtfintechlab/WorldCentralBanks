A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence provides information about Israel's sovereign risk premium, but does not directly relate to the Bank of Israel's monetary policy stance."
}
```

This sentence does not provide any information about the Bank of Israel's monetary policy decisions, interest rates, or guidance on future policy actions, which are typical indicators of a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance. Therefore, it is classified as "irrelevant".
2025-04-14 11:57:58,102 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides factual information about wage changes without indicating any specific direction or intention for monetary policy, thus it is neutral."
}
```

This sentence simply reports on wage changes without suggesting any implications for monetary policy, so it does not lean towards being hawkish (suggesting tighter monetary policy), dovish (suggesting looser monetary policy), or directly relevant to a policy stance. Therefore, it is classified as neutral.
2025-04-14 11:57:58,102 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence does not mention the Bank of Israel or its monetary policy meeting, and instead discusses the UK's budget cuts and fiscal policy."
}
```

This sentence appears to be unrelated to the Bank of Israel's monetary policy meeting, so I classified it as "irrelevant".
2025-04-14 11:57:58,102 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence does not mention the Bank of Israel's monetary policy or provide any indication of its stance."
}
```

The sentence appears to discuss external factors (commodity prices and interest rates in China) without referencing the Bank of Israel's monetary policy, making it irrelevant to the task.
2025-04-14 11:57:58,102 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that the disruptions in economic activity are transitory, implying a potentially accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

The reasoning behind this classification is that the sentence's tone and content imply a dovish stance, as it downplays the potential long-term impact of the disruptions and suggests that they are temporary, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy.

1. **Understanding the Sentence**: The sentence mentions that "the yield gap between local currency unindexed ten-year bonds and ten-year US Treasury bonds contracted from 163 b.p." This means that the difference in yield (interest rates) between long-term bonds in the local currency and those in the US (considered a benchmark) has decreased.

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions interest rate increases in multiple countries, indicating a tightening of monetary policy to combat faster inflation."
}
```

The label "hawkish" is assigned because the sentence describes actions (interest rate increases) and a context (faster inflation) that suggest a concern for inflation and a willingness to take action to mitigate it, which is characteristic of a hawkish monetary policy stance.
2025-04-14 11:58:00,271 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses unemployment rate data and does not mention or imply any monetary policy action or stance."
}
```

This sentence appears to be providing information about the unemployment rate and cautioning about the reliability of the data, without expressing any view on monetary policy. Therefore, it is classified as "irrelevant" to the monetary policy stance.
2025-04-14 11:58:00,271 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a stable mortgage interest rate, which suggests no change in the monetary policy stance, indicating a neutral tone."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence reports a stable mortgage interest rate, which implies that the monetary policy stance is not shifting towards tightening (hawkish) or easing (dovish). The increase in new mortgage volume and borrowers' LTV ratios is noted, but the stable interest rate suggests that the policy is not reacting to these changes in a significant way. 

Alternatively, one could argue that the stability

This sentence suggests that the speaker views the current monetary policy of major central banks as accommodative, which is consistent with a dovish stance. There is no indication of concerns about inflation or a need to tighten policy, which are typically associated with hawkish stances. The neutral label does not fit as the sentence clearly describes a specific policy stance, and "irrelevant" is not applicable

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence does not mention any monetary policy decisions or indicators related to the Bank of Israel's policy, making it irrelevant to the classification."
}
```

The sentence appears to discuss economic indicators (purchasing managers index) and trade between France, Germany, and Asia, but does not provide any information that would suggest a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance on monetary policy. Therefore, I classified it as "irrelevant".
2025-04-14 11:58:02,141 - together_inference - INFO - Response: {
"label": "irrelevant",
"justification": "The sentence does not convey any information about the Bank of Israel's monetary policy stance, as it only discusses the impact of a certain factor on real activity."
}
2025-04-14 11:58:02,141 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides factual information about price changes without indicating a tightening or loosening of monetary policy, thus maintaining a neutral stance."
}
```

The sentence simply reports on the past trends of prices of tradable and non-tradable goods without expressing any intention or inclination towards changing the monetary policy stance, which suggests a neutral classification.
2025-04-14 11:58:02,141 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies that the appreciation of the currency will hinder the return of inflation to the target range, suggesting a concern about tightening monetary policy too much, which is a dovish stance."
}
```
2025-04-14 11:58:02,141 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that the participants are aware of factors that could ease the increase in housing prices, implying a potentially less aggressive stance on inflation, which is a dovish signal."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "dovish" because it implies that the participants are considering factors that could moderate the increase in housing prices, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance. This is a dovish signal, as it suggests that the participants may be less likely to raise interest rates aggressively to combat inflation.

  "justification": "The sentence suggests that market expectations of additional interest rate reductions by the Bank of Israel have declined, but it does not indicate a clear shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy, hence a neutral stance."

Let me explain: 

The sentence mentions a decline in market expectations regarding additional interest rate reductions, which could be seen as a slightly hawkish signal. However, it also mentions a "marked exit by nonresident investors" which could be seen as a bearish signal. Overall, the sentence seems to be more descriptive of market
2025-04-14 11:58:04,240 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a concern about high inflation, which suggests a preference for tighter monetary policy, a characteristic of a hawkish stance."
}
```

The reasoning is that the sentence highlights the concern about inflation being above the target range, which is often associated with a hawkish monetary policy stance that prioritizes inflation control over growth. The mention of participants recommending no change in the face of high inflation also suggests that they are cautious about easing policy, further supporting the hawkish classification.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual update on US growth and consumption without expressing a clear stance on monetary policy, indicating a neutral tone."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply reports on economic data without suggesting a need for policy tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish), and does not provide a clear direction for future policy actions.
2025-04-14 11:58:04,240 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The mention of quantitative easing, which is a monetary policy tool that injects liquidity into the economy, suggests a dovish stance."
}
```

I classified the sentence as dovish because the mention of quantitative easing, which is typically used to stimulate economic growth, implies a more accommodative monetary policy stance.
2025-04-14 11:58:04,240 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance of the given sentence and provide a justification, let's analyze it step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Sentence
The sentence provided is: "macro data in the united states continue to be encouraging, the most salient being the rate of growth and the unemployment." This sentence discusses the state of macroeconomic data in the United States, highlighting positive trends in growth and unemployment rates.

## 2: Determine the Implications of the Data
Encouraging macroeconomic data, such as a strong rate of growth and low unemployment, typically suggest a robust economy. In the context of monetary policy, a strong economy can influence

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence is neutral as it only mentions discussion of impacts without indicating any specific policy action or bias towards tightening or loosening monetary policy."
}
```
2025-04-14 11:58:05,824 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that the Bank of Israel may need to ease monetary policy to counter the potential adverse impact of global economic uncertainty on domestic demand and the shekel's appreciation."
}
```

The sentence mentions potential risks to domestic demand and the possibility of renewed appreciation pressures on the shekel, which implies a concern about the potential need for monetary policy easing, characteristic of a dovish stance.
2025-04-14 11:58:05,824 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The market's expectation of no interest rate reduction in the coming year and the increase in yields along the entire curve suggest a hawkish monetary policy stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that hawkish monetary policy is characterized by a tendency to increase interest rates or to keep them high to control inflation, which seems to be reflected in the increase in yields and the market's expectation of no rate cut.
2025-04-14 11:58:05,824 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The committee's statement emphasizes conditionality and data dependence, suggesting a balanced approach rather than a clear tightening or easing bias."
}
```

This sentence suggests that the committee is maintaining a cautious and data-driven approach, which is consistent with a neutral monetary policy stance. The mention of "continued withdrawal from the accommodative policy" could suggest a hawkish tilt, but the emphasis on contingency and data dependence tempers this, making the overall tone more neutral.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that the Fed expects inflation to decrease, implying a potential easing of monetary policy, which is a dovish stance."
}
```

Note that although the text mentions the "Fed" (Federal Reserve, the central bank of the United States), the task is related to the Bank of Israel's monetary policy meeting. However, based on the content of the sentence, it seems to be related to the Fed's policy, not the Bank of Israel's. If we consider the sentence as irrelevant to the Bank of Israel's monetary

2025-04-14 11:58:12,125 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance of the given sentence and provide a concise justification, let's analyze the information provided:

The sentence mentions that "the scope of transactions increased in January compared with the corresponding period of the previous year, and in March mortgage volume was high compared to preceding months." This information indicates an increase in economic activity, specifically in transactions and mortgage volumes, but it does not directly imply a tightening or loosening of monetary policy. 

However, an increase in mortgage volume and transactions can be seen as signs of a growing economy or at least of increased financial activity. A hawkish stance is typically associated with concerns about inflation or economic

{
  "label": "neutral",

This sentence does not provide any information that would suggest a hawkish (favoring higher interest rates) or dovish (favoring lower interest rates) stance, so it is classified as neutral. The sentence is also not irrelevant, as it relates to the Bank of Israel's activities, but it does not convey a specific policy stance.

I chose "irrelevant" because the sentence does not contain any information related to monetary policy, interest rates, or the Bank of Israel's policy stance. It simply reports on a macroeconomic indicator (fixed investment growth), which is not directly related to monetary policy decisions.

```

The sentence does not suggest that the Bank of Israel is likely to tighten (hawkish) or loosen (dovish) its monetary policy. Instead, it presents a balanced view of the current situation, highlighting the effects of previous policy actions and other factors, which is consistent with a neutral monetary policy stance.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a moderation in the market, which could imply a less aggressive monetary policy stance, indicating a dovish tone."
}
```

The reasoning behind this classification is that the sentence mentions indicators pointing to a moderation in the market, such as a decline in home purchase transactions and a decrease in new mortgage volume. This type of language often suggests that the central bank may be inclined to maintain or adopt a more accommodative monetary policy stance, which is consistent with a dovish tone.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a slowing economy, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance, indicating a dovish tone."
}
```

The sentence describes a slowing economy with contracting industrial production and moderate retail sales growth, which implies that the economy may need stimulus, aligning with a dovish monetary policy stance.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a deteriorating global economy, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance, indicating a dovish tone."
}
```

My reasoning is that a deteriorating global economy is often associated with a dovish monetary policy stance, as it may prompt central banks to cut interest rates or implement other expansionary measures to mitigate the negative effects on the economy.

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence provides factual information about the shekel's exchange rate and does not convey any information about the Bank of Israel's monetary policy stance."
}
```

This sentence does not express a view on inflation, interest rates, or economic growth that would suggest a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance. It simply reports on the exchange rate of the shekel against the dollar, making it irrelevant to the classification of monetary policy stance.

{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses the Japanese economy and does not mention the Bank of Israel's monetary policy, making it irrelevant to the task."
}
```

This sentence does not provide any information about the Bank of Israel's monetary policy meeting, so it is classified as "irrelevant".
2025-04-14 11:58:27,835 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The Bank of Israel's statement highlights that inflation is within the target range, but expectations are at the upper limit, suggesting a balanced view that neither strongly leans towards tightening nor easing."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the statement mentions both positive and potentially concerning factors (inflation close to the midpoint but expectations at the upper limit), which suggests a neutral stance rather than a strongly hawkish or dovish one.

  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests stability in inflation expectations, which implies no immediate need for a change in monetary policy, hence a neutral stance."
}
```

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual explanation for the increase in M1 and does not express a clear stance on future monetary policy actions."
}
```

The sentence is neutral because it simply explains a phenomenon (the increase in M1) without expressing a view on the desirability of this development or suggesting a specific policy response. There is no indication of a hawkish (concerned about inflation and potentially raising interest rates) or dovish (concerned about growth and potentially lowering interest rates) stance.

I chose "neutral" because the sentence is more of a statement about a potential economic consequence rather than a clear indication of a hawkish (tightening) or dovish (loosening) monetary policy stance. The sentence does not contain language that would suggest a specific direction for monetary policy, and therefore I classified it as neutral.

2025-04-14 11:58:43,060 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance of the given sentence and provide a justification, let's analyze the content:

The sentence discusses market implications and expectations regarding interest rate changes, particularly focusing on the Federal Reserve's (Fed) approach and anticipated actions in relation to interest rates. It mentions the markets implying a probability of a quarter of a percentage point rise in the Fed rate by August and another rise in September.

Given that the sentence talks about anticipated increases in interest rates ("a quarter of a percentage point rise in the fed rate by august, and a further rise of the same amount in the september interest rate meeting"), this suggests a tightening or less accommodative

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual description of economic activity trends without indicating any specific monetary policy action or bias."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply reports on the state of various industries without suggesting any particular direction for monetary policy, nor does it imply a concern that would typically prompt a hawkish (tightening) or dovish (loosening) stance.
2025-04-14 11:58:43,060 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that the Fed is expected to lower the interest rate, indicating a loosening of monetary policy, which is a dovish stance."
}
```

Note that the sentence actually refers to the Fed (Federal Reserve), not the Bank of Israel, but based on the task, I assume the focus is on classifying the monetary policy stance mentioned. 

If the task specifically relates to the Bank of Israel and this sentence is considered irrelevant due to mentioning the Fed instead, an alternative classification could be:

```

2025-04-14 11:58:43,060 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance of the given sentence and provide a justification, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Understanding the Labels**:
   - **Hawkish**: Indicates a stance that is more concerned with inflation and might lean towards increasing interest rates or tightening monetary policy.
   - **Dovish**: Suggests a stance focused on economic growth and employment, possibly leaning towards lowering interest rates or easing monetary policy.
   - **Neutral**: Implies a balanced or neutral view on monetary policy, neither strongly hawkish nor dovish.
   - **Irrelevant**: The information provided does not relate to monetary policy.

2025-04-14 11:58:43,060 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Based on the given sentence, I would classify the monetary policy stance as follows:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a neutral forecast of economic growth and inflation without indicating any specific policy action or bias."
}
```

The sentence seems to provide a factual forecast of economic growth and inflation without expressing a clear stance on monetary policy, which aligns with a neutral classification. There is no indication of a hawkish (concerned about inflation and potentially raising interest rates) or dovish (focused on growth and potentially lowering interest rates) stance. Therefore, the label "neutral" is assigned.

  "justification": "The sentence suggests that the housing price index continued to increase, which could indicate a need for tighter monetary policy to curb inflation, aligning with a hawkish stance."
}
```

The reasoning behind this classification is that a hawkish monetary policy stance is typically associated with concerns about inflation and a desire to raise interest rates to slow down economic growth. The sentence's focus on the continued increase in the housing price index, which is a component of the CPI, implies that inflationary pressures are persisting, which is a concern that could lead

  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that the Fed is expected to maintain a low interest rate, indicating a accommodative monetary policy stance, which is characteristic of a dovish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence implies that the Fed will keep interest rates low for an extended period, which is a sign of a dovish monetary policy stance. A dovish stance is associated with a more accommodative monetary policy, where the central bank prioritizes economic growth and employment over inflation concerns.
