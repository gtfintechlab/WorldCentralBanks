A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

The sentence discusses specific changes in the CDS (Credit Default Swap) spreads of several countries (Russia, Czech Republic, Turkey, and Poland) over a certain period and attributes these changes to the increased concern over financial institutions' stability following the Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy. The information provided is factual, historical, and quantifiable.

1. **Factual Content**: The sentence reports on historical events and data (CDS spreads of various countries and the impact of Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy). Such information is typically considered factual.

2. **Language Tone**: The language used is objective
2025-04-14 11:55:32,906 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and implications.

The sentence is: "the expansionary policy of central banks in major advanced economies is expected to continue, according to their announcements, later into the year as well."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence contains the phrase "is expected to continue," which indicates a prediction or forecast rather than a statement of fact. This suggests that the outcome is not certain but rather anticipated based on current information.

2. **Justification**: The use of "is expected to continue" and reference to "their announcements" implies a level of uncertainty since it is based on current expectations and announcements

The sentence is: "the point was emphasized that forecasters’ predictions were currently at the upper limit of the target inflation range, and those derived from the capital market were even higher."

This sentence reports on a statement made, specifically what was emphasized regarding forecasters' predictions and market-derived inflation expectations. It does not express a direct opinion or uncertainty about future events but rather states what was highlighted or reported.

However, the nature of the information (forecasters' predictions and market-derived expectations) is inherently about future outcomes or expectations, which are typically subject to uncertainty. Still,

The sentence is: "the investment houses on average expect that the fed will lower the interest rate by contracts on the fed interest rate reflect a 100 percent probability of a cut of 25 basis points in the rate for the same period."

First, we need to understand that the sentence is discussing expectations and probabilities related to the Federal Reserve's (Fed) decision on interest rates, as reflected by contracts on the Fed interest rate. Although it mentions a "100 percent probability," which might initially suggest certainty, the context is about expectations and market reflections rather than a statement of fact

The sentence is: "[3] this was due mainly to the appreciation of the shekel against the euro by about 2.8 percent, and by about 1.7 percent against the dollar."

1. **Understanding the task**: We need to determine if the sentence is certain or uncertain regarding the Bank of Israel's monetary policy meeting.

The sentence is: "the chinese new year may account for part of the decline, but it appears that the contractionary policy also played a part."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence contains phrases like "may account for" and "it appears," which indicate a level of uncertainty or speculation about the causes of the decline.

The sentence discusses the Bank of Israel's approach to changing interest rates, conditioning it on several factors such as the inflation environment, global economic growth, interest rates of major central banks, and the shekel's exchange rate. It describes the process as "gradual" and outlines specific, albeit varied, conditions under which the interest rate is adjusted.

Given this, the sentence is more about explaining the Bank's policy and the factors influencing its decisions rather than expressing uncertainty about future actions.
