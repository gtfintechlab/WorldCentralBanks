A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

2025-04-14 12:41:56,688 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides factual information about housing debt and interest rates without indicating a clear direction or bias in monetary policy, thus maintaining a neutral tone."
}
```

The sentence primarily reports on the current state of housing debt and interest rates without expressing a clear stance on future monetary policy actions, which aligns with a neutral classification.
2025-04-14 12:41:56,688 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence focuses on discussing uncertainty and does not indicate a clear inclination towards tightening or loosening monetary policy."
}
```

The sentence appears to be more focused on acknowledging the uncertainty surrounding the health and economic scenarios, rather than expressing a clear stance on monetary policy. Therefore, I classified it as "neutral".
2025-04-14 12:41:56,688 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence does not mention the Bank of Israel's monetary policy or provide any indication of a stance on interest rates or economic conditions that would influence such a policy."
}
```

This sentence appears to be discussing global banking sector pressures, specifically in Europe, without referencing the Bank of Israel or its monetary policy. Therefore, it is classified as "irrelevant" to the Bank of Israel's monetary policy meeting.
2025-04-14 12:41:56,688 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates a decline in interest rates on indexed mortgages and stability in unindexed floating-rate mortgages, suggesting an accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that a decline in interest rates is typically associated with a dovish monetary policy stance, which aims to stimulate economic activity by making borrowing cheaper.
2025-04-14 12:41:56,688 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates a willingness to take further steps to ease monetary policy, suggesting a dovish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the language used in the sentence, which implies that the committee is open to taking additional actions to make monetary policy more accommodative, which is a characteristic of a dovish monetary policy stance.
2025-04-14 12:41:58,340 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence merely notes a trend of appreciation of the shekel without expressing a clear stance on monetary policy or indicating any intention to intervene."
}
```

This sentence appears to be a factual observation rather than a statement of policy intention, so it is classified as neutral.
2025-04-14 12:41:58,340 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance based on the given sentence, we should consider what "hawkish," "dovish," and "neutral" mean in the context of monetary policy:

- Hawkish: Refers to a monetary policy stance that is likely to raise interest rates to combat inflation, indicating a concern for inflation over growth.
- Dovish: Refers to a monetary policy stance that is likely to lower interest rates to stimulate economic growth, indicating a concern for growth over inflation.
- Neutral: Refers to a monetary policy stance that is neither clearly hawkish nor dovish, suggesting no immediate change in interest rates.

Given
2025-04-14 12:41:58,340 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a predicted reduction in interest rates, indicating an easing of monetary policy, which is a dovish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that a reduction in interest rates is typically associated with a dovish monetary policy stance, as it implies that the central bank is willing to stimulate the economy by making borrowing cheaper.
2025-04-14 12:41:58,340 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that the Fed expects inflation to decrease, implying a potential easing of monetary policy, which is a dovish stance."
}
```

However, I noticed that the sentence actually refers to "the fed" which might indicate it's not directly related to the Bank of Israel's monetary policy meeting. Given that, a more accurate response would be:

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence refers to the Fed's expectations, making it irrelevant to the Bank of Israel's monetary policy meeting

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides factual information about the shekel's exchange rate fluctuations without expressing a clear stance on monetary policy, indicating a neutral tone."
}
```

The sentence simply reports on the shekel's exchange rate movements against the dollar and euro without expressing a view on inflation, interest rates, or economic growth, which are typical aspects of a hawkish, dovish, or even clearly neutral monetary policy stance. Therefore, it is classified as neutral.
2025-04-14 12:41:59,726 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that a depreciation of the shekel, which is typically associated with loose monetary policy, would be an acceptable or desirable outcome to achieve inflation goals."
}
```

This classification is based on the understanding that a dovish monetary policy stance is associated with a willingness to tolerate or induce economic conditions that might be considered accommodative, such as depreciation of the currency, to achieve goals like bringing inflation within a target range.
2025-04-14 12:41:59,726 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses European macroeconomic data and does not mention the Bank of Israel's monetary policy or provide any indication of a policy stance."
}
```

This sentence does not provide any information related to the Bank of Israel's monetary policy meeting or stance, therefore it is classified as "irrelevant".
2025-04-14 12:41:59,726 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The decision to hold onto purchased securities implies a status quo, indicating no immediate change in the monetary policy stance, which is characteristic of a neutral stance."
}
```
2025-04-14 12:41:59,726 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The announcement of a targeted plan to assist small and micro businesses adversely impacted by the war indicates a supportive and accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence mentions a plan to assist businesses, which implies a willingness to take action to support the economy, a characteristic of a dovish monetary policy stance.

This classification is based on the idea that a dovish stance is associated with a more accommodative or expansionary monetary policy, which is hinted at by the sentence's implication that the appreciation of the shekel will ease the forecast.

2025-04-14 12:42:01,222 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance of the given sentence and provide a justification, let's analyze it step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Sentence
The sentence provided is: "consumer confidence indices indicate weakness, due mainly to the decline in the real wage." This sentence discusses the current state of consumer confidence and its relation to the decline in real wages.

## 2: Determine the Implications for Monetary Policy
A decline in consumer confidence, often associated with economic weakness, can influence a central bank's monetary policy decisions. Typically, weak consumer confidence and declining real wages suggest that the economy might be underperforming, which could lead to

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a tightening of monetary policy as nominal yields on short-term instruments have risen, suggesting a potential interest rate hike, which is a hawkish stance."
}
```

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies concern about high home price growth, which may lead to a tightening of monetary policy, indicating a hawkish stance."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "hawkish" because it highlights a markedly high rate of home price growth, which could be seen as a sign of inflationary pressures, and may prompt the Bank of Israel to consider tightening monetary policy to mitigate these pressures.

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates an upward revision in the interest rate forecast, suggesting a tighter monetary policy stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence mentions an increase in the expected interest rate from 5.75 percent to 6.25 percent, which implies a more restrictive monetary policy outlook, characteristic of a hawkish stance.
2025-04-14 12:42:02,756 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides factual information about home price increases without expressing a clear stance on monetary policy or suggesting future actions."
}
```

The sentence simply reports on home price increases, without indicating a tightening or loosening of monetary policy, or suggesting that the Bank of Israel will change its policy stance. Therefore, it is classified as "neutral".
2025-04-14 12:42:02,756 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a concern for economic weakness, indicating a likely easing of monetary policy, which is a dovish stance."
}
```

The sentence mentions a low level of activity, a widening output gap, and expected increases in unemployment, which are all indicators of economic weakness. This concern for economic weakness is typically associated with a dovish monetary policy stance, which prioritizes economic growth and employment over inflation concerns.
2025-04-14 12:42:02,756 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence reports on bond index changes without mentioning any monetary policy decisions or guidance, making it irrelevant to the monetary policy stance."
}
```

This sentence simply reports on the performance of specific bond indices without providing any insight into the Bank of Israel's monetary policy decisions or tone, which is why it's classified as "irrelevant".
2025-04-14 12:42:02,756 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies potential concerns about inflationary pressures and financial stability risks, which is consistent with a hawkish monetary policy stance."
}
```

My reasoning is that the rapid increase in home prices and growth in mortgage volume may suggest to policymakers that the economy is overheating, which could lead to inflationary pressures. A hawkish stance is often associated with concerns about inflation and a desire to tighten monetary policy to mitigate these risks. 

In contrast, a dovish stance would be more focused on supporting economic growth, a neutral stance would

  "justification": "The sentence is neutral as it simply mentions the Bank of Israel's use of econometric models to test scenarios without indicating any specific policy action or bias."
}
```

The sentence does not convey any specific monetary policy stance, such as a tendency to tighten (hawkish) or loosen (dovish) policy, nor does it provide information that would be unrelated to monetary policy (irrelevant). Instead, it presents a factual statement about the Bank of Israel's methodological approach to analyzing economic scenarios.

  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence highlights an increase in housing prices, which could be seen as a sign of inflationary pressures, suggesting a potential need for tighter monetary policy, a hawkish stance."
}
```

The reasoning behind this classification is that the sentence mentions an increase in housing prices, which could be perceived as a sign of inflationary pressures. A hawkish monetary policy stance is typically associated with concerns about inflation and a desire to tighten policy to mitigate it.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a stable and slightly increasing inflation expectation, which does not suggest a strong inclination towards tightening or loosening monetary policy, indicating a neutral stance."

```

The reasoning behind this classification is that the sentence describes a relatively stable and slightly increasing inflation expectation, which does not suggest a significant concern about inflation (which would be hawkish) or a need to stimulate the economy (which would be dovish). The tone is informative and descriptive, without implying a specific policy action, which is consistent with a neutral monetary policy stance.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence presents a balanced view of the macroeconomic data, describing it as a 'mixed picture', which suggests a neutral stance."

I chose "neutral" because the sentence does not indicate a clear inclination towards tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) monetary policy, and the phrase "mixed picture" implies a balanced assessment of the data.

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a strong economy with a tight labor market, which could lead to inflationary pressures and thus a hawkish stance from the central bank."

```

The reasoning behind this classification is that a strong economy with a tight labor market may lead to inflationary pressures, which a hawkish central bank would seek to mitigate through tighter monetary policy. 

However, it is worth noting that the sentence does not directly relate to the Bank of Israel's monetary policy meeting, but based on the information given, the classification is done.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The statement that inflation was within the target range suggests a neutral stance, as it neither strongly supports raising nor lowering interest rates."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence simply states a fact about inflation being within the target range, without expressing a strong preference for tightening or loosening monetary policy. The mention of increasing the interest rate is part of the context, but the specific reason provided does not lean towards a hawkish or dovish stance.

The sentence simply reports on the CPI rise in relation to forecasts and the inflation target, without suggesting that the Bank of Israel will tighten (hawkish) or loosen (dovish) its monetary policy. Therefore, I classify the sentence as neutral.

The sentence simply reports on various economic indicators, such as the composite state of the economy index, climate indices, and consumer confidence indicator, without expressing a clear bias towards tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) monetary policy. Therefore, I classify the monetary policy stance as neutral.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides factual information about credit card purchases without indicating any change in monetary policy or expressing a clear stance on inflation or economic growth."

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply reports on a economic indicator (credit card purchases) without suggesting any implications for monetary policy or expressing a clear view on the economy that would lean towards a hawkish (concerned about inflation) or dovish (focused on growth) stance.

## 2: Interpret the change in yield gap
A narrowing of the yield gap means that the difference in yields between tel-bonds and government bonds has decreased. Typically, government bonds are considered very

The sentence mentions "the disappointing figures on wages in the last two months threaten the continuation of this trend." This implies a concern about economic indicators (wage figures) and their impact on a trend, likely referring to economic growth or inflation.

## 2: Identify key elements
- The term "disappointing figures on wages" suggests that the current wage growth is not as strong as expected or desired.
- The phrase "threaten the continuation of this trend" implies

The sentence provided does not contain information related to the Bank of Israel's monetary policy meeting or stance, making it irrelevant to the task.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a neutral economic indicator, describing a moderate pace of expansion without suggesting any drastic changes that would necessitate a policy shift."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply reports a factual economic update without implying any urgency for a policy tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish), and it does not seem unrelated to monetary policy discussions (irrelevant).

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The increase in yields on government bonds and makam suggests a tightening of monetary policy, which is a hawkish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that an increase in yields on government bonds and makam (a type of short-term interest rate) indicates a tightening of monetary policy, which is typically associated with a hawkish stance. A hawkish stance is characterized by a central bank's efforts to reduce inflation or slow down an overheating economy, often through interest rate increases or other policy measures that reduce liquidity.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies that the Bank of Israel is concerned about the stability of the eurozone and the EU's decision-making process, suggesting a cautious or accommodative stance."
}
```

My reasoning is that the sentence highlights a concern about the weakness in the decision-making process of the eurozone and the EU, which could have implications for the global economy and potentially lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance, characteristic of a dovish tone.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests improved consumer confidence, which could lead to increased spending and economic growth, implying a potentially accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

However, I can also argue that the sentence is actually "neutral" or even "irrelevant" because it simply reports on consumer confidence indices without directly mentioning the Bank of Israel's monetary policy. 

A more accurate response would be:

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses the government's budget deficit and does not provide any information about the Bank of Israel's monetary policy stance."
}
```

This sentence does not mention interest rates, inflation, or any other typical monetary policy indicators, so it is classified as "irrelevant" to the Bank of Israel's monetary policy meeting.
2025-04-14 12:42:23,387 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates a commitment to a predefined goal, which suggests a neutral stance as it does not imply a deviation from the existing policy target."
}
```

This sentence does not suggest a tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) of monetary policy but rather reaffirms the committee's commitment to an existing goal, which is to maintain price stability as defined by the Bank of Israel law. Therefore, it is classified as neutral.
2025-04-14 12:42:23,387 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual update on the growth rate of business credit without expressing a clear stance on future monetary policy actions."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply reports on current trends in business credit growth without indicating a tightening or loosening of monetary policy, nor does it suggest that the Bank of Israel will change its policy stance in the near future.

## Step 1: Understand the Sentence
The sentence provided is: "this contrasts with the usual trend of an increase in mortgages in the summer months." The sentence seems to discuss a deviation from a typical pattern related to mortgages and their seasonal variation.

## 2: Determine the Monetary Policy Stance
- A "hawkish" stance refers to a preference for reducing inflation, often through higher interest rates, even if it means slower economic growth.
- A "dovish" stance prioritizes economic growth

## Step 1: Understand the context of monetary policy stances
- "Hawkish" refers to a monetary policy stance that is likely to increase interest rates to curb inflation, indicating concern about inflationary pressures.
- "Dovish" refers to a stance that is likely to decrease interest rates or keep them low to stimulate economic growth, indicating concern about economic growth and possibly lower inflation.
- "Neutral" indicates a balanced view, suggesting that the current policy is appropriate, and there's no strong inclination to change it significantly
2025-04-14 12:42:34,633 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a prolonged period of low interest rates, indicating an accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

The sentence suggests that the interest rate will remain low for an extended period, which is a characteristic of a dovish monetary policy stance. This indicates that the central bank is prioritizing economic growth and stability over inflation concerns, which is consistent with a dovish label.
2025-04-14 12:42:34,633 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a preference for reducing interest rates aggressively to achieve the inflation target, indicating a dovish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence mentions reducing the interest rate by a larger amount to achieve the target inflation rate sooner, which is a characteristic of a dovish monetary policy stance. A dovish stance typically prioritizes economic growth and lower inflation over concerns about inflation, and is often associated with lower interest rates.
2025-04-14 12:42:34,633 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence provides information about Israel's risk premium, but does not convey any information about the Bank of Israel's monetary policy stance."
}
```

This sentence does not provide any information about the Bank of Israel's monetary policy decisions, outlook, or bias, which are typically used to classify the stance as hawkish, dovish, or neutral. Therefore, it is classified as "irrelevant".
2025-04-14 12:42:34,633 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses economic forecasts for Europe and the Eurozone, but does not mention the Bank of Israel's monetary policy or indicate a stance on interest rates."
}
```

This sentence does not provide any information about the Bank of Israel's monetary policy meeting or its stance on interest rates. Therefore, it is classified as "irrelevant".

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions an interest rate cut by the ECB and markets pricing in future interest rate cuts, indicating a loosening of monetary policy."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence describes a surprise interest rate cut by the ECB and expectations of similar cuts in other economies, which suggests an accommodative or dovish monetary policy stance.
2025-04-14 12:42:36,148 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence highlights potential risks to the economy, such as depreciation of the shekel and decline in domestic investments and demand for private consumption, suggesting a cautious tone that is typically associated with a dovish stance."
}
```

This sentence does not explicitly mention interest rates or monetary policy actions, but the tone and content imply a concern for economic stability and potential downside risks, which is more aligned with a dovish stance. The focus on potential adverse impacts on exports, investments, and consumption suggests that the Bank of Israel might be inclined to take
2025-04-14 12:42:36,148 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The statement suggests that inflation is expected to be within the target range, indicating no immediate concern for drastic policy changes, hence a neutral stance."
}
```

This sentence does not indicate a clear intention to tighten (hawkish) or loosen (dovish) monetary policy. Instead, it provides a somewhat balanced view by mentioning that inflation will be within the target range but close to its upper limit, and is expected to decline thereafter, which justifies a neutral classification.
2025-04-14 12:42:36,148 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that a recession is spreading, implying a need for accommodative monetary policy, which is a dovish stance."
}
```

My reasoning is that the sentence highlights a recessionary trend, which typically calls for a more accommodative or dovish monetary policy stance to mitigate its effects. There is no indication of concerns about inflation or a need to tighten policy, which are characteristics of a hawkish stance. The sentence is also not neutral, as it implies a specific policy direction, and it is relevant to monetary policy,
2025-04-14 12:42:36,148 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance of the given sentence and provide a justification, let's analyze it step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Context
The sentence discusses economic growth figures in the US, highlighting a slowdown in growth rates for two consecutive quarters, with actual growth significantly lower than expected.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates that the interest rate is expected to remain unchanged, which suggests a neutral monetary policy stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence mentions the expectation of no change in the interest rate, which is a neutral policy action. There is no indication of a tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) of monetary policy.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence is neutral as it only mentions the assessment of the global economy without indicating any specific policy action or bias towards tightening or loosening monetary policy."

I chose "neutral" because the sentence focuses on the assessment of the global economy, highlighting both positive and negative developments, without expressing a clear inclination towards a more restrictive (hawkish) or accommodative (dovish) monetary policy stance.

{
  "label": "irrelevant",
