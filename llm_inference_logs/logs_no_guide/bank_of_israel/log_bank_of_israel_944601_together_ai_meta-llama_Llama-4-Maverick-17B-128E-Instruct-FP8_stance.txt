A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence discusses the balance of housing debt and changes in interest rates in the unindexed variable rate segment. It states that the balance of housing debt increased by 6.9 percent since August of the previous year and mentions that interest rates in a specific segment again increased by about 0.1 percentage points.

Given this information, we can infer that the sentence is more related to the state of housing debt and interest rate changes rather than directly stating the Bank of Israel's monetary policy stance. However, the increase in interest rates
2025-04-14 12:44:15,670 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence according to the Bank of Israel's monetary policy stance, let's analyze its content and implications.

The sentence mentions "exceptional uncertainty regarding the health-related and economic scenarios expected in Israel and abroad, and the uncertainty regarding the fiscal policy expected to be adopted in case of the crisis being extended." This discussion indicates a focus on the negative impacts of uncertainty and a potential crisis, which typically suggests a cautious or accommodative stance rather than a restrictive one.

Given this context, the classification can be determined as follows:
