A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

1. **Understanding the Sentence**: The sentence discusses a specific economic data point regarding the change in nominal and real wages over a defined period (September–November compared to June–August), with the data being seasonally adjusted and presented at an annual rate.

2. **Identifying Certainty or Uncertainty**: 
   - The sentence reports a factual piece of information about wage changes.
   - It provides specific percentages and time frames.
   - The data is described as "seasonally adjusted, annual rate," indicating a processed statistic rather than a raw or speculative figure.

The sentence provided is: "the uk also announced deep budget cuts that incorporated reduced expenditure, increased taxes and surcharges on banks, in an attempt to reduce the large budget deficit."

Let's break down the task:

1. **Understanding the Sentence**: The sentence talks about the UK announcing deep budget cuts, including specifics like reduced expenditure and increased taxes, to reduce a large budget deficit. It does not directly relate to the Bank of Israel or its monetary policy meeting.

First, we need to understand what the sentence is stating. It talks about two economic indicators: the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) and exports by France and Germany to Asia. The PMI is a measure of the economic health of the manufacturing sector, and exports are a component of a country's GDP.

1. **Understanding the Statement**: The sentence states that the PMI "rose for the tenth month in succession," which is a factual statement
2025-04-14 12:01:56,941 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, "the major harm on real activity will be felt through tourism," we need to assess whether it expresses a certain or uncertain outcome regarding the Bank of Israel's monetary policy meeting.

The sentence is making a statement about a future impact. The key to determining its certainty lies in understanding the language used. The phrase "will be felt" indicates a prediction or expectation about the future rather than a statement of fact or absolute certainty.

Here's the classification:

```json
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence uses 'will be felt', indicating a definitive prediction about the future impact."
2025-04-14 12:01:56,941 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and structure.

The sentence states: "over the past 12 months, prices of tradable goods in the cpi declined by 2.2 percent, and the prices of nontradable items increased by 0.5 percent."

This sentence reports historical data regarding the prices of tradable and non-tradable goods within the Consumer Price Index (CPI) over a specific period. The information is presented in a factual manner without any speculative or predictive language.

Given the factual nature of the statement and the absence of any language indicating doubt, speculation, or uncertainty, the classification should reflect that
2025-04-14 12:01:56,941 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "they assessed that continuation of the appreciation will weigh on the return of inflation toward the midpoint of the target range."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence implies a future condition ("continuation of the appreciation") and its potential impact ("will weigh on the return of inflation"). The use of "will weigh" indicates a prediction or expectation about a future outcome rather than a statement of fact. This suggests uncertainty because the outcome depends on the condition being met.

2. **Justification**: The sentence is classified as "uncertain" because it discusses a potential
2025-04-14 12:01:56,941 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "some of the participants noted that there were forces acting to moderate the rate of increase in housing prices."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence is discussing an observation made by "some of the participants," which implies a subset of individuals involved in the discussion, not a unanimous or definitive statement. The language used does not convey absolute certainty.

2. **Justification**: The use of "some of the participants noted" introduces ambiguity and indicates that not all participants agreed or observed the same thing, hence the sentence is classified as "uncertain".
