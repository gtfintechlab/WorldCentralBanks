A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes specific historical events and data, such as changes in CDS spreads and the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, which are verifiable facts."
}
```

The sentence reports on past events and provides specific data, which can be verified or disproven. There is no ambiguity or uncertainty in the sentence, hence the classification as "certain".

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'expected' and 'according to their announcements', which indicate a level of uncertainty or conditionality about future events."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because, despite the announcements, the future actions of central banks are not guaranteed, and the use of "expected" implies a degree of unpredictability.

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents information as factual and specific, without using language that suggests uncertainty or doubt.

The sentence is classified as "uncertain" because it expresses a prediction or expectation about future market volatility, rather than stating a fact. The use of words like "expected" and the mention of "multiple risk loci" suggest that there are uncertainties and potential risks that may affect market volatility, making the statement uncertain.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses uncertainty due to the use of 'expected' and the presentation of a range for the interest rate (3.75 percent or 4 percent)."

```

This classification is based on the presence of the word "expected" which indicates a prediction or forecast rather than a statement of fact, and the presentation of two possible values for the interest rate, which introduces ambiguity.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses potential impacts and emphasizes the importance of future policy, indicating uncertainty about future outcomes."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it mentions potential impacts and the importance of future policy, which implies a degree of uncertainty about what will happen. The sentence does not make a definitive statement about a specific outcome, but rather analyzes the situation and highlights the relevance of future policy decisions.
2025-04-14 11:53:14,365 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific, factual change in the CPI-indexed bonds yield curve, indicating a certain event."
}
```

The sentence reports a specific change in the yield curve (it became steeper) and provides a specific detail about the change (long-term yields increased by between 12 b.p.), which suggests that the information is presented as a fact, rather than a possibility or prediction.
2025-04-14 11:53:14,365 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a possibility of harm rather than a definite outcome, indicating uncertainty."

```

This classification is based on the use of words like "possible" and "some", which suggest a degree of uncertainty rather than certainty.

Although the sentence states that expectations are stable, it does not guarantee that the interest rate will not change, and expectations can change over time. Therefore, I classified it as uncertain.
