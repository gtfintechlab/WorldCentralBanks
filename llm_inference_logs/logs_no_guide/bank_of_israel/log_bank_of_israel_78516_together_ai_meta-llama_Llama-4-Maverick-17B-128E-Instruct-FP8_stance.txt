A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

2025-04-14 12:00:45,580 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence according to the Bank of Israel's monetary policy stance, let's analyze the information provided.

The sentence discusses the changes in Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by the five-year CDS (Credit Default Swap) spread. It mentions that the spread declined from 121 basis points to 100 basis points but then increased again to 116 basis points. The information provided is factual and relates to the country's credit risk perception in the financial markets.

The change in the CDS spread is an indicator of the market's perception of Israel's creditworthiness and sovereign risk. A decrease in the spread generally indicates an improvement in the perceived creditworthiness
2025-04-14 12:00:45,580 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence according to the Bank of Israel's monetary policy stance, let's analyze its content and implications.

The sentence provided is: "in the three months september–november the nominal wage dropped by 1.1 percent and the real wage dropped by 4.3 percent, compared with the level in june–august (seasonally adjusted, annual rate)."

1. **Understanding the Content**: The sentence discusses a decline in both nominal and real wages over a specific period. A drop in wages can be associated with various economic conditions, including lower labor demand or economic slowdown.

2. **Monetary Policy
2025-04-14 12:00:45,580 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence according to the Bank of Israel's monetary policy stance, we must analyze its content and relevance to monetary policy decisions.

The sentence provided is: "the uk also announced deep budget cuts that incorporated reduced expenditure, increased taxes and surcharges on banks, in an attempt to reduce the large budget deficit."

1. **Relevance to Monetary Policy**: The sentence discusses fiscal policy measures taken by the UK, including budget cuts, increased taxes, and surcharges on banks, aimed at reducing a large budget deficit. While it touches upon economic policy, it specifically refers to fiscal policy rather than monetary policy.

2. **Classification**:
2025-04-14 12:00:45,580 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence and provide a justification, let's analyze it step by step.

1. **Understanding the sentence**: The sentence mentions a "sharp correction to commodity prices" following concerns over a possible interest rate increase in China. It does not directly discuss the Bank of Israel's monetary policy actions or decisions.

2. **Analyzing the content**: The sentence talks about the impact of external factors (concern over interest rate increase in China) on commodity prices. It doesn't directly mention or imply the Bank of Israel's stance on monetary policy (e.g., interest rates, quantitative easing).

3. **Classifying the sentence**:

2025-04-14 12:00:45,580 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence according to the Bank of Israel's monetary policy stance, let's analyze its content and implications.

The sentence mentions "disruptions in economic activity" accompanied by "increases in energy prices" and "delays in various production and supply chains" that are considered "transitory." The focus on disruptions and the characterization of the supply chain issues as transitory suggests a concern for the current economic situation but also implies an expectation that these issues are temporary.

Given this context, the sentence leans towards a dovish stance because it highlights challenges to economic activity and implies that these challenges are temporary, potentially justifying accommodative
