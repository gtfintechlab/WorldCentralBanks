A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

2025-04-14 12:45:26,185 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence states: "the balance of housing debt was nis 272 billion at the end of august, an increase of 6.9 percent since august of remained essentially unchanged, while interest rates in the unindexed variable rate segment again increased by about 0.1 percentage points, following a similar increase in august."

This sentence reports specific, factual data regarding the balance of housing debt and changes in interest rates without expressing any doubt or uncertainty about the information presented.

Therefore, the classification should be based on the certainty of the information provided.

Here's the output following the required structure
2025-04-14 12:45:26,185 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and implications.

The sentence is: "the committee discussed the exceptional uncertainty regarding the health-related and economic scenarios expected in israel and abroad, and the uncertainty regarding the fiscal policy expected to be adopted in a case of the crisis being extended."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence explicitly mentions "exceptional uncertainty" and discusses uncertain scenarios and policies, indicating a lack of clear direction or outcome.

2. **Justification**: The presence of the word "uncertainty" twice in the sentence and the discussion around uncertain future scenarios and policies directly implies that the situation is uncertain.

Therefore, the output
2025-04-14 12:45:26,185 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, we need to analyze its content and tone to determine if it expresses certainty or uncertainty regarding the context of the Bank of Israel's monetary policy meeting.

The sentence provided is: "the banking sector around the world, specifically in europe, is under pressure due to its exposure to bonds of countries in difficulty."

Let's break down the task:

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence states a fact or condition ("is under pressure") without expressing doubt or ambiguity about the situation. It directly links the condition of the banking sector to its exposure to certain bonds, indicating a cause-and-effect relationship that is presented as factual.

2
2025-04-14 12:45:26,185 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence states: "rates of interest on indexed fixed- and floating-interest-rate mortgages continued to decline, and those on unindexed floating-rate mortgages remained stable in the last few months."

This sentence reports on historical data regarding interest rates on different types of mortgages, indicating a clear and factual observation about past trends.

Given the factual nature of the statement and the absence of speculative or forward-looking language, the classification should reflect a high degree of certainty.

Here's the output following the required structure:

The sentence is: "according to the bank of israel assessment published in april, gdp will increase by exports."

1. **Understanding the task**: We need to determine if the sentence is certain or uncertain regarding the Bank of Israel's monetary policy meeting.

2. **Analyzing the sentence**: The sentence refers to an assessment by the Bank of Israel published in April, stating that GDP will increase due to exports. The key elements here are "according to the Bank of Israel assessment" and "GDP will increase by exports."

3. **Determining certainty or uncertainty**:

2025-04-14 12:45:50,876 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, we need to analyze its content and tone to determine whether it conveys certainty or uncertainty regarding the macroeconomic data in the US.

The sentence states: "macroeconomic data in the us which were published this month continue to be encouraging, particularly employment figures, sales and production indices, and credit figures."

Here's the step-by-step thought process:
1. The sentence reports on macroeconomic data that "continue to be encouraging." The use of "continue" suggests a positive trend observed over some time.
2. It specifies the types of data that are encouraging, such as employment figures, sales, production indices, and credit figures,
2025-04-14 12:45:50,876 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, "the rate of reduction in unit labor costs has moderated, however," we need to analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is stating a fact about the rate of reduction in unit labor costs having moderated. The use of "however" indicates a contrast or a shift in the discussion, but it does not inherently introduce uncertainty about the fact being stated. The statement itself is assertive regarding the moderation of the rate of reduction.

Therefore, the classification should be based on whether the sentence expresses a fact or introduces doubt.

Given this analysis, the output should be:

The sentence states: "the expansionary policy of central banks in major advanced economies is expected to continue, according to their announcements, later into the year as well."

2025-04-14 12:46:12,669 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and structure.

The sentence states: "the yield to maturity on cpi-indexed five-year government bonds declined in november (to the 19th of the month) from their october level of about 1.1 percent to an average of about 1 percent."

This sentence reports a historical fact regarding the yield to maturity on specific government bonds, providing specific data and a clear comparison between two time periods (October and November up to the 19th). The language used is factual and does not contain any speculative or uncertain terms.

Therefore, the classification should be based on the certainty
2025-04-14 12:46:12,669 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze it step by step.

The sentence is: "the nominal wage per employee post rose in the business sector fell by 1.3 percent in july, and that in the public sector by 0.7 percent."

First, we need to understand the content and tone of the sentence. The sentence appears to be reporting factual data regarding changes in nominal wages in different sectors.

Upon closer inspection, the sentence seems to be slightly awkwardly phrased or possibly contains a typographical error ("per employee post rose" is unclear), but it is still conveying specific numerical data about wage changes.
