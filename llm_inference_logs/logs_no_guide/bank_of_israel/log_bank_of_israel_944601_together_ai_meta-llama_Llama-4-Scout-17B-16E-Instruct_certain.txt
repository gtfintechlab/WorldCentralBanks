A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports specific data and changes in financial metrics, such as debt balance and interest rates, without expressing any doubt or ambiguity."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents factual information about the balance of housing debt, interest rates, and percentage changes, without using words or phrases that indicate uncertainty, such as "approximately," "around," "suggests," or "it is likely that." The language used is objective and reports specific data, indicating a certain tone.

2025-04-14 12:42:49,981 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports specific, factual changes in interest rates over a defined period, without expressing doubt or ambiguity."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it describes specific changes in interest rates (decline, remained stable) over a specific period (the last few months), without using words or phrases that indicate uncertainty, such as "may", "could", "likely", or "it is expected that". The language used is factual and descriptive, indicating a certain state of affairs.
2025-04-14 12:42:49,982 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a prediction about future GDP growth based on an assessment, implying uncertainty about the outcome."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it expresses a prediction or forecast about future GDP growth, which is inherently uncertain. The use of "will increase" also suggests a degree of uncertainty, as it is not a statement of fact but rather a projection.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a prediction about future events, using phrases like 'predict on average' and 'will be about', which indicate uncertainty."

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence contains words and phrases that suggest a degree of uncertainty or prediction, rather than stating a fact or a certainty. The use of "predict on average" and "will be about" implies that the outcome is not guaranteed, but rather a forecast or expectation.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words and phrases that indicate uncertainty, such as 'expects', 'in line with its expectation', and 'some easing', which suggest a degree of unpredictability."
}
```

The sentence is classified as uncertain because it expresses a prediction or expectation rather than a statement of fact, and contains words and phrases that indicate a degree of uncertainty or unpredictability.

The sentence expresses a prediction about future CPI readings, which implies some level of uncertainty. The use of "expected" and "as well" suggests that the outcome is not guaranteed, leading to an uncertain classification.

{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence's use of the phrase 'reacted with stability' implies a subjective interpretation of market reactions, leaving room for ambiguity."

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains the word 'expected', which indicates a degree of uncertainty or prediction rather than a statement of fact."

```

This sentence is classified as uncertain because it expresses a prediction or expectation about future events (the rise in CPI housing component) rather than stating a known fact.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports on specific economic indicators and their implications, presenting them as facts rather than possibilities or opinions."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it describes specific economic data and their potential effects on price stability using phrases that imply a degree of factuality and inevitability, such as "noted the threat", "a further rise", "an improvement", and "the rise", which suggest that the described events are happening or have happened rather than being speculative or uncertain.

However, I can also argue that:

```

Upon reevaluating, I think the second classification is more accurate because the sentence discusses potential future risks and consequences ("risks of inflation deriving from... rolling over into wage rises"), which introduces some level of

{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence presents a factual analysis of the impact of the shekel's appreciation on the low inflation rate, without expressing any doubt or ambiguity."
}

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents a factual analysis of the relationship between the shekel's appreciation and the low inflation rate, using phrases such as "stress the high contribution" that imply a clear and established understanding of the situation.

Note that the sentence does not directly relate to the Bank of Israel, which might already suggest uncertainty. Moreover, the verb "tended towards" implies a direction or inclination rather than a definitive action, further supporting the classification as uncertain.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a possibility or a desired outcome ('would be more likely to become consistent') rather than a definitive fact or decision."

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific, measurable change in Israel's risk premium, citing exact numbers, indicating a factual and certain statement."

This sentence is classified as "certain" because it provides specific, quantifiable data (52 basis points to 63 basis points) and does not contain any ambiguous language or expressions of doubt, which are typical characteristics of certain statements.
2025-04-14 12:43:19,308 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains phrases with ranges and expected values, such as 'between minus one percent and zero' and 'expected to be', which indicate uncertainty."

{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions that 'the markets are pricing in interest rate cuts in other economies', implying a prediction or expectation rather than a confirmed event."

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a potential risk scenario with conditional language, indicating uncertainty about future events."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "uncertain" because it discusses a possible scenario that may or may not materialize, using phrases such as "the main risk to the forecast" and "the scenario in which", which indicate uncertainty about future events.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'expected' and 'close to', which indicate a degree of uncertainty or imprecision in the prediction."
}
```

The sentence is classified as uncertain because it uses words and phrases that suggest a range of possible outcomes rather than a definitive statement, indicating that the outcome is not entirely predictable.
2025-04-14 12:43:20,561 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains phrases like 'has started to spread' which imply a degree of ambiguity and unpredictability, indicating uncertainty."
}
```

This sentence is classified as uncertain because it expresses a possibility or a trend rather than a definitive fact, and the use of phrases like "has started to spread" implies some degree of doubt or ambiguity.
2025-04-14 12:43:20,561 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports specific, factual data and statistics about economic growth rates, indicating a certain or factual tone."

```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents concrete, numerical data (e.g., "1 percent", "1.8 percent", "0.4 percent") and describes specific events (e.g., "the figure for the first quarter was adjusted sharply downwards"), which suggests a factual and certain tone.
