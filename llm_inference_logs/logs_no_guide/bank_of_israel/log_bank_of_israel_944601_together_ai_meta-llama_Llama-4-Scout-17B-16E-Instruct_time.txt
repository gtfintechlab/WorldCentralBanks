A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence reports historical data and past changes in interest rates, without discussing future expectations or projections."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "not forward looking" because it focuses on reporting past data and changes, specifically the balance of housing debt and interest rates in the unindexed variable rate segment up to the end of August, without mentioning any future outlook or projections.
2025-04-14 12:43:33,146 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses expected future scenarios and policies, indicating a focus on future events and prospects."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "forward looking" because it mentions "expected" scenarios and policies, which implies a focus on future events and prospects. The use of words like "expected" and "to be adopted" suggests that the sentence is discussing potential future developments, making it forward looking.
2025-04-14 12:43:33,146 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a current state of the banking sector, without making a prediction or referring to future events or actions."
}
```

This sentence is not forward looking because it discusses the current situation of the banking sector, specifically its exposure to bonds of countries in difficulty, without expressing a prediction or referring to future events or actions that might be taken.
2025-04-14 12:43:33,146 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence describes past trends in interest rates, using phrases such as 'in the last few months', indicating a focus on historical data rather than future projections."
}
```
2025-04-14 12:43:33,146 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence contains a future projection about GDP increase driven by exports, indicating a forward-looking statement."
}
```

This classification is based on the presence of the phrase "will increase", which indicates a prediction or projection about a future event, making the sentence forward looking.
