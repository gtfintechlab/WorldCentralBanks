A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence discusses home prices and their changes over specific past periods (May-June and June-July), referencing data from the Central Bureau of Statistics. It does not mention or imply any future expectations, predictions, or decisions related to the Bank of Israel's monetary policy.

Given this analysis, the classification should be based on whether the sentence looks forward or not.
