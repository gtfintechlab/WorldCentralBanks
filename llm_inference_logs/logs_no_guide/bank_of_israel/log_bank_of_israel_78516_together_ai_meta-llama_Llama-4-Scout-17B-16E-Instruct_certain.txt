A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

This sentence is classified as "certain" because it describes a specific action taken by the UK, which can be verified as true or false, and does not contain any ambiguous or speculative language.
2025-04-14 11:59:00,862 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains phrases such as 'possible increase' and 'there was a sharp correction', which indicate uncertainty and variability."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it expresses a possibility ("possible increase") and describes a market reaction ("sharp correction") that may not be predictable or guaranteed, implying a degree of uncertainty.
2025-04-14 11:59:00,862 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a presumption of transience, implying some degree of uncertainty about the duration of the delays in production and supply chains."
}
```

The sentence is classified as "uncertain" because it uses phrases like "it is reasonable to presume" and implies that the duration of the delays is not yet clear, leaving room for doubt.

```

This sentence is classified as "certain" because it presents a factual and specific piece of information about a past event (a decline in the nominal yield) with a clear and quantifiable measure (0.2 percentage points), without any hedging or uncertainty language.
2025-04-14 11:59:11,163 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific and factual increase in goods imports, without any hedging or ambiguity."
}
```

However, I can also argue that:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence includes the phrase 'about 1 percent', which implies some degree of approximation or uncertainty."
}
```

Upon reevaluating, I think the second classification is more accurate, as the use of "about" does introduce some degree of uncertainty.

So, the final output is:

```

  "label": "

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific statistical fact about the balance of outstanding housing credit, without any expression of doubt or ambiguity."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "certain" because it presents a factual piece of information with a specific number (0.5 percent increase) and a clear reference point (twelve months to November), indicating a statement of fact rather than an uncertain or speculative one.

{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'expected' and 'would be', which indicate a degree of uncertainty or prediction rather than a statement of fact."
}
```

This sentence is classified as uncertain because it expresses a prediction or expectation about the future, rather than stating a fact. The use of "expected" and "would be" suggests a degree of uncertainty or conditionality.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'limited' and 'expected' that imply a degree of uncertainty or unpredictability."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it contains words that suggest a lack of clear or definitive information. The word "limited" implies a degree of ambiguity, and "expected" suggests a prediction or forecast that may not necessarily materialize. This language contributes to an overall tone of uncertainty.

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence expresses a prediction or expectation rather than a statement of fact, which inherently carries some degree of uncertainty. The use of "expect" and "on average" suggests that there is some variability or doubt involved, making the statement uncertain.
