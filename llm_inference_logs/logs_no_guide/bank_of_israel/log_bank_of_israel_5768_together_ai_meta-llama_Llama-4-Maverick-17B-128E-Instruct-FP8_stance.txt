A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

2025-04-14 11:55:07,459 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence according to the Bank of Israel's monetary policy stance, let's analyze its content and implications.

The sentence mentions that the inflation environment has moderated in numerous countries but remains above central bank targets, partly due to sticky inflation in services. This context suggests that inflation is still a concern, as it remains above target levels.

Given this information, we can infer that the Bank of Israel is likely to maintain a cautious or tightening stance on monetary policy to manage inflation, rather than easing it.

Therefore, the classification should reflect a stance that is more inclined towards controlling inflation.
