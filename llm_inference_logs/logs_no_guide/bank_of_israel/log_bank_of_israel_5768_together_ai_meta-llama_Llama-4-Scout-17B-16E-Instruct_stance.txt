A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence does not mention the Bank of Israel's monetary policy meeting or any related decision, making it irrelevant to the task."
}
```

The sentence appears to discuss the global financial crisis and its impact on various countries' credit default swap (CDS) spreads, but it does not mention the Bank of Israel or its monetary policy meeting, making it irrelevant to the task.
2025-04-14 11:51:37,889 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a continued accommodative monetary policy stance, which is characteristic of a dovish stance."
}
```

The sentence mentions an "expansionary policy" which suggests a loose monetary policy, and the expectation that it will continue, which is aligned with a dovish stance.
2025-04-14 11:51:37,889 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The mention of inflation predictions being at or above the target range suggests a concern about inflation, which is a hawkish stance."
}
```

This sentence implies that the Bank of Israel is paying close attention to inflation and potentially preparing to take action to mitigate it, which is consistent with a hawkish monetary policy stance.
2025-04-14 11:51:37,890 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a factual decline in mortgage grants without implying any change in the monetary policy stance."

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a slowing economy, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance, indicating a dovish tone."

The sentence describes a slowing economy with contracting industrial production and moderate retail sales growth, which could prompt a central bank to adopt a more dovish stance, potentially cutting interest rates or implementing other expansionary policies to stimulate the economy.
2025-04-14 11:51:39,523 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence does not mention monetary policy, interest rates, or any related economic indicators, making it unrelated to the Bank of Israel's monetary policy stance."
}
```

This sentence appears to be discussing a specific economic trend (decline in exports) but does not provide any information that would suggest a tightening, loosening, or neutral monetary policy stance. Therefore, I classify it as "irrelevant" to the Bank of Israel's monetary policy meeting.
2025-04-14 11:51:39,523 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual update on the growth rate of business credit without expressing a clear stance on future monetary policy actions."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply reports on current trends in business credit growth without indicating a tightening or loosening of monetary policy, nor does it suggest that the Bank of Israel will change its policy stance in the near future.
2025-04-14 11:51:39,523 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence does not mention the Bank of Israel or its monetary policy, and instead discusses Germany's trade surplus and the eurozone's economy."
}
```

This sentence does not provide any information related to the Bank of Israel's monetary policy meeting, so it is classified as "irrelevant".
2025-04-14 11:51:39,523 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The increase in inflation expectations above the target range suggests a potential concern about inflation, which is typically associated with a hawkish monetary policy stance."
}
```

This sentence implies that the inflation expectations are slightly above the target range, which may lead to a concern about inflation. This concern is typically associated with a hawkish monetary policy stance, which tends to prioritize inflation control over economic growth. 

Let me know if you have any further questions!

{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a positive trend in the labor market, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

My reasoning is that a decrease in unemployment is often seen as a sign of a strengthening economy, which could lead to inflationary pressures, but in the context of monetary policy, it might also suggest that the economy is improving, and therefore, the central bank might be more inclined to keep policy loose or ease it further, which is a dovish stance. 

However, I can also see how one might

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that a rate cut is expected, indicating a loosening of monetary policy, which is a dovish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the expectation of a rate cut, which is a sign of a dovish monetary policy stance. The text does not relate to the Bank of Israel's monetary policy meeting, but based on the content, the stance can be identified. 

However, please note that the sentence seems to be referring to the Federal Reserve (Fed) rather than the Bank of Israel. If the

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence provides factual information about currency exchange rates without indicating any change in monetary policy stance."
}
```

This sentence does not provide any information that would suggest a hawkish (more aggressive in raising interest rates), dovish (more inclined to lower interest rates), or neutral (no change in interest rates) stance. It simply reports on the appreciation of the shekel against other currencies, making it irrelevant to the classification of monetary policy stance.
2025-04-14 11:51:41,355 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The mention of 'contractionary policy' suggests a tightening of monetary policy, which is a hawkish stance."
}
```

Explanation: 
The sentence mentions "contractionary policy", which implies a reduction in the money supply or an increase in interest rates, typically done to combat inflation or curb economic growth. This kind of policy is associated with a hawkish monetary policy stance, which prioritizes controlling inflation over stimulating economic growth.
2025-04-14 11:51:41,356 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual observation about the decline in investment in residential construction without expressing a clear stance on monetary policy or indicating a need for immediate action."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply reports on a economic indicator without suggesting a specific policy response or tone that would lean towards being hawkish (tightening) or dovish (loosening). The tone is informative and observational, rather than advocating for a particular policy direction.

2025-04-14 11:51:44,743 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance of the given sentence and provide a justification, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Understanding the Context**: The sentence discusses the December Consumer Price Index (CPI) in relation to the Bank of Israel's assessment and the forecasts of private forecasters. 

2. **Interpreting the Data**: The CPI was unchanged, which is lower than both the Bank of Israel's predicted increase of about 0.4 percent and the average prediction of private forecasters of a 0.3 percent rise.

3. **Monetary Policy Stance Definitions**:
   - **Hawkish**: Suggests a tightening
2025-04-14 11:51:44,743 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that the central bank is taking measures to lower interest rates and support economic activity, indicating a accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

This sentence indicates a dovish stance because it mentions actions aimed at lowering interest rates and supporting economic activity, which are typically associated with an expansionary monetary policy.
2025-04-14 11:51:44,743 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that the lowering of global interest rates and expectations of further reductions will strengthen the shekel and moderate inflationary pressures, implying a accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "dovish" because it implies that the speaker is supportive of a loose monetary policy, which is consistent with a dovish stance. The mention of lowering interest rates and expectations of further reductions suggests that the speaker is prioritizing economic growth and stability over inflation concerns, which is a key characteristic of dovish monetary policy.
2025-04-14 11:51:44,743 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The decision to leave the interest rate unchanged at 3.25 percent indicates a neutral stance, as it implies no change in the current monetary policy."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence does not indicate any inclination towards tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) monetary policy, but rather maintaining the status quo.
2025-04-14 11:51:44,743 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides factual information about the CPI rise, comparing it to forecasts and the inflation target, without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply reports on the CPI data and its relation to expectations and the inflation target, without suggesting any specific action or tone that would indicate a hawkish (more aggressive on inflation) or dovish (more accommodative) stance.

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply reports on the committee's assessment of the global economy, highlighting both positive and negative developments, without expressing a clear stance on monetary policy. This suggests a balanced view without a clear inclination towards a hawkish (more aggressive tightening) or dovish (more accommodative) stance.

2025-04-14 11:51:48,374 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance of the given sentence and provide a justification, let's analyze the content:

The sentence mentions factors such as rising wages, vigorous private consumption, inflation abroad, and an expansionary fiscal policy. These elements typically suggest a strong or growing economy, which might necessitate a tightening of monetary policy to prevent overheating or to curb inflation.

## Analysis:
- **Rising wages and vigorous private consumption** indicate a strong economy.
- **Inflation abroad** could influence domestic inflation, especially in an open economy.
- **Expansionary fiscal policy** is typically associated with economic stimulus, which can lead to inflationary pressures if

{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a potential slowdown in the global economy, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance."

## Step 1: Understand the context of the sentence
The sentence mentions reports from participating companies being reminiscent of reports during the period of economic slowdown from 2001 to the middle of 2003. This implies a comparison to a past period of economic slowdown.

## 2: Determine the implications of referencing a past economic slowdown
Referencing a period of economic slowdown (2001 to the middle of 2003) could imply that the current situation might be similar, suggesting potential for economic weakness or

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions a sharp decrease in bond yields, which is often associated with a loosening of monetary policy, indicating a dovish stance."
}
```

My reasoning is that a decrease in bond yields, especially of around 100 basis points, suggests a significant easing of financial conditions, which is typically aligned with a dovish monetary policy stance, aiming to stimulate economic activity.
2025-04-14 11:52:00,426 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The committee's statement acknowledges both the current stable price trend and the potential risk of future price increases, indicating a balanced and cautious approach."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence neither strongly suggests a tightening of monetary policy (hawkish) nor a loosening (dovish), but rather a careful consideration of the current situation and potential future risks.
2025-04-14 11:52:00,426 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions rising global inflation risks, which typically prompts a hawkish monetary policy stance to curb inflation."
}

{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides factual information about home prices without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance."
}
```

```

The sentence implies that the committee is not overly concerned about inflation, which is a characteristic of a dovish monetary policy stance. The fact that they note inflation is "relatively low" and at the "bottom of the distribution among OECD countries" suggests that they may be inclined to keep policy loose or ease it further, rather than tightening it, which is in line with a dovish

  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that inflation expectations are low, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance."

The reasoning behind this classification is that if short-term inflation expectations are around the lower bound of the target range, it implies that there is no immediate inflationary pressure, which might lead the central bank to adopt a more dovish or accommodative monetary policy stance to stimulate the economy.

This classification is based on the fact that a decline in interest rates is typically associated with a dovish monetary policy stance, which aims to stimulate economic activity by making borrowing cheaper.
2025-04-14 11:52:05,185 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence is too general and doesn't convey a clear stance on monetary policy, as it only mentions the discussion and decision-making process without indicating a specific direction for interest rates."
}
```
2025-04-14 11:52:05,185 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides factual information about commodity prices without indicating a clear direction for future monetary policy, thus maintaining a neutral tone."
}
```

This sentence does not express a clear stance on monetary policy, nor does it suggest that the Bank of Israel will tighten (hawkish) or loosen (dovish) policy. The information provided seems more related to external factors influencing prices rather than a direct statement on monetary policy, hence the classification as "neutral".
2025-04-14 11:52:05,185 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a mixed change in the index of trade and services revenue, which does not provide clear evidence to suggest a tightening or loosening of monetary policy, thus indicating a neutral stance."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply reports a data point without any clear implication for monetary policy, and does not suggest a shift towards a more hawkish (tightening) or dovish (loosening) stance.

2025-04-14 11:52:06,732 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my attempt to classify the sentence:

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence does not mention any monetary policy decisions, interest rates, or economic indicators that would suggest a stance on monetary policy."
}
```

The sentence appears to be discussing labor market trends, specifically the number of new job postings, recruitment of new workers, and dismissals, without referencing any monetary policy actions or implications. Therefore, I classify it as "irrelevant" to the Bank of Israel's monetary policy meeting.
2025-04-14 11:52:06,732 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides information that inflation expectations have been close to the midpoint of the target range for over a year, indicating a stable outlook that aligns with a neutral monetary policy stance."
}
```

The reasoning behind this classification is that the sentence does not indicate any inclination towards raising or lowering interest rates, but rather presents a neutral assessment of the inflation expectations, which is consistent with a neutral monetary policy stance.
2025-04-14 11:52:06,732 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a forecast of economic growth without expressing a clear stance on monetary policy, indicating a neutral tone."
}
```

This sentence does not express a clear stance on monetary policy, as it simply provides an economic growth forecast without mentioning interest rates, inflation, or any other monetary policy indicators. Therefore, I classified it as "neutral".
2025-04-14 11:52:06,732 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that forecasters expect a rise in the Bank of Israel's policy rate, indicating a tightening of monetary policy, which is a hawkish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that a hawkish monetary policy stance is characterized by a tendency to increase interest rates to combat inflation or maintain economic stability, which aligns with the expected rise in the policy rate mentioned in the sentence.
2025-04-14 11:52:06,732 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The decline in inflation expectations suggests a reduced need for aggressive monetary policy, which is a dovish signal."
}
```

The reasoning behind this classification is that a decline in inflation expectations typically suggests that the economy may not require as much monetary policy tightening, which is a dovish stance. This indicates that the central bank may be more likely to keep interest rates low or even consider easing monetary policy.

2025-04-14 11:52:17,198 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance based on the given sentence, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Understanding the Sentence**: The sentence mentions that the CPI-indexed bonds yield curve became steeper due to an increase in long-term yields by between 12 basis points (b.p.).

2. **Interpreting the Change**: A steeper yield curve often indicates that long-term interest rates are rising more than short-term rates. This can be a sign of expected economic growth or inflation.

3. **Monetary Policy Stance**:
   - **Hawkish**: A hawkish stance is associated with concerns about inflation and tends

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates that expectations for the Bank of Israel's interest rate are stable, implying no expected change in the monetary policy stance."
}

This classification is based on the fact that "stable" expectations for interest rates suggest that the market does not anticipate any significant tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) of monetary policy, hence a neutral stance.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual report on credit growth without expressing a clear stance on monetary policy, hence it is classified as neutral."
}
```

The sentence simply reports a statistical fact about credit growth without indicating a hawkish (concerned about inflation and potentially raising interest rates), dovish (concerned about growth and potentially lowering interest rates), or clearly irrelevant (not related to monetary policy) tone. Therefore, I classify it as neutral.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions uncertainty, which suggests a cautious tone, but does not explicitly indicate a tightening or loosening of monetary policy, hence a neutral stance."

I chose "neutral" because the sentence highlights uncertainty but doesn't convey a clear direction for monetary policy, which is a key aspect of hawkish (tightening) or dovish (loosening) stances.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that the Bank of Israel expects a decline in demand to moderate price increases, implying a potentially accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

This sentence implies a dovish stance because it highlights factors that would lead to lower inflation, which could justify keeping interest rates low or even cutting them, rather than emphasizing the need to control inflation through higher interest rates, which would be a hawkish stance.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides factual information about tax revenues and the consumer price index, without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance."
}
```

The sentence appears to be providing neutral, factual information about economic indicators, without expressing a clear hawkish (concerned about inflation) or dovish (concerned about growth) tone. Therefore, I classified it as "neutral".
2025-04-14 11:52:24,101 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a positive outlook on employment and economic recovery, implying that the Bank of Israel may maintain or ease its monetary policy stance."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "dovish" because it indicates a positive expectation for economic recovery and employment growth, which is typically associated with a more accommodative monetary policy stance. This suggests that the Bank of Israel may be inclined to keep interest rates low or even consider easing policy to support the recovery.
2025-04-14 11:52:24,101 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a tightening of monetary policy as nominal yields on short-term instruments have risen, suggesting a more restrictive stance."
}
```

The sentence suggests that the Bank of Israel's monetary policy is becoming more hawkish, as indicated by the increase in nominal yields on short-term instruments. This is a sign of a more restrictive monetary policy stance, which is characteristic of a hawkish position.

I chose "dovish" because the sentence mentions a "strong commitment to finding a solution to the crisis" and notes "positive returns in financial markets around the world during the recent period", which suggests that the committee is focused on supporting the economy and financial markets, rather than worrying about inflation or tightening policy. This tone is consistent with a dovish monetary policy

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence is too general and doesn't indicate a clear direction of monetary policy, as it only mentions that the committee will decide on the appropriate interest rate for the economy."
