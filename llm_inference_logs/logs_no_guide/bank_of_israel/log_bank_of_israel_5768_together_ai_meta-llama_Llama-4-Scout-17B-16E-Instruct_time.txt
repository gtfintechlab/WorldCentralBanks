A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence describes past events and changes in financial markets, without expressing a prediction or outlook for future events."
}
```

The sentence discusses historical changes in CDS spreads and the impact of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, which suggests that it is describing past events rather than looking forward to future events.
2025-04-14 11:53:34,295 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence contains future-oriented language, specifically 'later into the year', indicating a projection or prediction about future events."

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses past data and trends, without making any statements about future expectations or projections."
}
```

This sentence is not forward looking because it only reports on past data (total mortgages granted in the twelve months ending in April and March) and describes a past trend (the decline from the peak level in May 2011), without expressing any expectations or projections about future events or economic indicators.
