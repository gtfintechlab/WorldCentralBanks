A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence simply states that market-based measures of inflation compensation have declined and survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, without expressing a view on future developments or expectations. Therefore, it is classified as "not forward looking".

Although the sentence mentions "anticipation of stronger global economic growth", which could be seen as forward-looking, the overall context of the sentence is describing past events and trends, making it not forward-looking. The anticipation is also described as something that has already occurred, rather than a prediction for the future.
