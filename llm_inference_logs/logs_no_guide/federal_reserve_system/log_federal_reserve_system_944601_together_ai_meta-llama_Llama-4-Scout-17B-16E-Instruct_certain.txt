A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence implies that the combined events had some effect on policy expectations, but the use of 'some' and 'restrain' suggests a degree of ambiguity and uncertainty."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "uncertain" because it contains words and phrases that imply a degree of ambiguity and imprecision, such as "some", which suggests that the effect of the events on policy expectations is not clear-cut or definitive.
2025-04-14 23:45:16,485 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence lists specific individuals who voted for a particular action, indicating a definitive outcome."
}
```

This sentence appears to be a factual report of the voting outcome, listing specific individuals who voted for a particular action, which suggests a certain outcome. There is no ambiguity or uncertainty expressed in the sentence.
2025-04-14 23:45:16,485 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a specific past situation with clear actions and consequences, indicating a certain state of affairs."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it refers to specific, identifiable past events (unsustainable rates of investment by high-tech firms) and describes their current situation (retrenching despite high growth rates) in a factual manner, without expressing doubt or uncertainty.

The sentence simply states facts about seasoned equity offerings and initial public offerings in specific months, comparing them to previous years, without any language that suggests uncertainty or speculation about future events.
2025-04-14 23:45:18,108 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses uncertainty due to the presence of words like 'reportedly', 'somewhat', and 'potentially', which indicate a lack of absolute certainty."

The sentence is classified as "uncertain" because it contains words and phrases that convey a degree of uncertainty or ambiguity, such as "reportedly", "somewhat", and "potentially". These words suggest that the information is not presented as a fact, but rather as a possibility or a reported concern, which justifies the classification as uncertain.

```
{

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a specific trend with concrete data, indicating a factual report rather than a speculative or uncertain statement."
}
```

I chose "certain" because the sentence reports on specific, observable data ("outlays on drilling and mining structures continued to climb", "available data pointed to ongoing growth"), which suggests a factual and confident assertion rather than an uncertain or speculative one.
2025-04-14 23:45:19,521 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific comparison between two economic projections, indicating a factual and definitive statement."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents a factual comparison between two specific economic projections, without expressing any doubt or ambiguity. The use of phrases like "the near-term forecast" and "on net, than in the previous projection" suggests a definitive statement about the staff's economic outlook.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports historical facts about employment trends in June without expressing doubt or ambiguity."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "certain" because it presents information as factual and does not contain words or phrases that indicate uncertainty, such as "likely," "may," or "uncertain." The use of specific data ("in June") and assertive verbs ("rose," "decreased") further supports this classification.

{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports specific, factual observations about the effects of the slowdown in the energy sector on certain areas, without expressing any doubt or ambiguity."

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents information as factual and observed, without using language that suggests uncertainty or doubt.

```

Although the sentence mentions assessing incoming data and evolving outlook, which could introduce some uncertainty, the key phrase "it does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range" and "until it has gained greater confidence" suggests a clear and firm stance, leaning towards certainty in the context of their policy decision-making process.
