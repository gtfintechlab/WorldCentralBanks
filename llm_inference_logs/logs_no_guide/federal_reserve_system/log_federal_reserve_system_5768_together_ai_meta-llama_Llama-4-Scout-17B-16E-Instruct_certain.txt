A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports specific facts about the outcome of TSLF auctions, indicating a certain state of affairs."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it states concrete, factual information about the oversubscription of specific auctions, without expressing any doubt or uncertainty.
2025-04-14 23:34:55,604 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes past effects of disruptions on economic activity and financial conditions, indicating a factual and certain assessment of their impact."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it uses verbs in the past tense (e.g., "had significantly affected", "had impaired") and does not express doubt or uncertainty about the effects of the disruptions. The language used suggests a factual report of what happened, rather than a speculative or uncertain assessment.
2025-04-14 23:34:55,604 - together_inference - INFO - Response: ```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a concern about a potential future scenario, indicated by phrases such as 'could entail' and 'if an upward drift in inflation expectations ensued', which suggest uncertainty."
}
```
2025-04-14 23:34:55,605 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses ambiguity and differing opinions among participants, indicating uncertainty about the committee's future actions and the effects of an on RRP facility."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "uncertain" because it presents multiple perspectives and possibilities, rather than a definitive or conclusive statement. The use of phrases such as "some participants suggested", "some others pointed out", and "possible effects" contribute to the uncertainty.
2025-04-14 23:34:55,605 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses uncertainty due to the phrase 'but there were few signs', which implies a lack of clear evidence or ambiguity about future labor costs."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because the phrase "there were few signs" suggests that the situation is not clear-cut, and the sentence as a whole implies a degree of ambiguity or uncertainty about the state of labor costs.

This classification is based on the presence of the words "risks" which generally implies uncertainty, and the use of "both downside and upside" which explicitly suggests that there are multiple possible outcomes, hence uncertainty.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a factual statement about the credit quality of nonfinancial corporations without any expressions of doubt or ambiguity."

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents a clear and definitive statement about the credit quality of nonfinancial corporations, using phrases such as "remained generally strong" and "low default rates", which indicate a factual report rather than an uncertain or speculative one.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains phrases such as 'at least in the near term' and 'incoming information about the economy and the prospects for fiscal policy', which introduce uncertainty and conditionality."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it contains phrases that suggest a degree of unpredictability and conditionality, indicating that the outcome is not entirely certain.

However, I can also argue that it is uncertain due to the discretionary part:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains a conditional phrase 'at the discretion of the chair', which introduces some level of uncertainty."
}
```

Given that there is a fixed policy with a minor conditional variation, I would argue that it is more certain than uncertain.

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents concrete information about economic indicators, such as vacancy rates, property prices, and financing conditions, without expressing any doubt or uncertainty. The use of specific data sources, like the "July Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey", also supports the classification as certain.

{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes expected future events using a tone of confidence and certainty, with no expressions of doubt or uncertainty."
}
```

However, upon re-reading, I realize that there are several conditional phrases that suggest uncertainty. Here is the revised classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains phrases such as 'was expected to be supported' and 'a further easing of the economic stresses in europe', which indicate some level of uncertainty or conditionality."
}
```

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports past facts about payrolls and unemployment rate, which can be verified with data."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "certain" because it describes specific, verifiable data about the past (march increase in payrolls and unemployment rate), which can be confirmed or denied with factual evidence.
