A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports factual information about specific economic indicators without expressing doubt or ambiguity."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents information about economic trends and data (e.g., bond issuance, commercial and industrial loans, leveraged loans, and collateralized loan obligations) in a factual and definitive manner, without using uncertain language such as "may," "could," or "uncertain."
2025-04-14 23:40:04,015 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains phrases such as 'more than offset', 'stronger-than-expected', and 'perceptions of receding downside risks', which indicate uncertainty and conditionality."
}
```

The sentence is classified as "uncertain" because it describes a complex situation with various factors influencing the outcome, and the language used suggests that the effects are not definite or predictable.
2025-04-14 23:40:04,015 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence explicitly mentions 'uncertainty' and refers to an 'outlook' that is not specified, indicating a lack of clear information."
}
```
2025-04-14 23:40:04,015 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence presents a statement as a fact without any ambiguity or indication of doubt."
}
```

The sentence directly states that credit continued to be available to most businesses, households, and municipalities, without using any uncertain language or hedging, which suggests that the information is being presented as a certainty.

  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a conditional or hypothetical scenario, using phrases such as 'might be required' and 'meant that', which indicate uncertainty."
}
```

This sentence is classified as uncertain because it discusses possibilities and conditions rather than stating a fact or a definitive course of action. The language used, such as "might be required" and "meant that", suggests a degree of uncertainty and speculation about the future.
