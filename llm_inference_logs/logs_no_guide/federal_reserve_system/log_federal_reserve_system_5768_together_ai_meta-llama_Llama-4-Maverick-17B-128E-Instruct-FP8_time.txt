A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "the disruptions to economic activity here and abroad had significantly affected financial conditions and had impaired the flow of credit to u.s. households and businesses."

This sentence discusses the past impact of disruptions on financial conditions and the flow of credit, indicating it is focused on past events rather than future expectations or actions.

Therefore, the classification is as follows:

```json

The sentence is: "moreover, participants expressed concern that a failure of inflation to moderate as expected could entail significant costs if an upward drift in inflation expectations ensued."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence discusses potential future outcomes based on certain conditions (inflation not moderating as expected and an upward drift in inflation expectations). This indicates a consideration of future scenarios or consequences, which is characteristic of forward-looking statements.

2. **Justification**: The sentence is classified as "forward looking" because it discusses potential future outcomes and the consequences of certain economic conditions not being met

The sentence is: "real disposable income continued to increase in the first quarter, further gains in house prices likely bolstered household net worth, and consumer sentiment in the thomson reuters/university of michigan surveys of consumers improved, on balance, in march and april."

First, we need to understand what "forward looking" means in the context of the Federal Reserve System's monetary policy meeting. Forward-looking statements typically refer to future events, expectations, or projections.

Let's break down the sentence:
1. "real disposable income continued to increase in the first quarter"
2025-04-14 23:38:17,250 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and context.

The sentence is: "the current regime was therefore effective both in providing control of the policy rate and in ensuring transmission of the policy stance to other rates and broader financial markets."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence discusses the effectiveness of the "current regime" in terms of monetary policy control and transmission. It does not explicitly mention or imply future actions, decisions, or expectations regarding the monetary policy.

2025-04-14 23:38:40,383 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and context.

The sentence is: "the chairman may approve a schedule of potential drawings, and may delegate to the manager, system open market account, the authority to approve individual drawings that occur according to the schedule approved by the chairman."

This sentence discusses the potential actions or decisions that the chairman may take regarding approving a schedule of potential drawings and delegating authority. The use of "may approve" and "may delegate" indicates future possibilities or potential decisions rather than statements about past or current actions. It implies looking ahead to what could happen or what is being considered for the future.

Therefore
2025-04-14 23:38:40,383 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and context.

The sentence is: "consumer credit continued to grow on a year-over-year basis, but the expansion of credit card and auto loan balances appeared to slow from the rapid pace that was evident through the end of last year."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence discusses past trends and current state ("continued to grow", "appeared to slow") without directly indicating future actions or expectations of the Federal Reserve or the economy.

2. **Justification**: The sentence is describing historical data and trends without making a statement that looks ahead to future events, policies, or expectations.

Therefore
2025-04-14 23:38:40,383 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze it step by step.

The sentence is: "members saw both downside and upside risks to prospects for inflation."

1. **Understanding the sentence**: The sentence discusses the perception of the Federal Reserve System members regarding the risks associated with future inflation prospects. It mentions "downside and upside risks," which indicates a consideration of potential future outcomes.

2. **Determining if it's forward-looking**: A statement is considered "forward-looking" if it discusses future events, expectations, or projections. The key phrases here are "prospects for inflation," which directly relate to future expectations or outcomes.

3. **Classification**:
2025-04-14 23:38:40,383 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, we need to analyze its content and determine whether it refers to future events or current/past situations.

The sentence provided is: "exports of industrial supplies and consumer goods also moved up smartly in september."

Let's break down the task:

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence is talking about exports "in September," which indicates it is discussing a past event since it doesn't specify a future date relative to the time of speaking or writing.

2. **Justification**: The sentence refers to a past event ("in September") and does not contain any information about future expectations or plans.

Therefore, the classification should be
2025-04-14 23:38:40,383 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and implications.

The sentence is: "surveys and information gathered from contacts in several districts indicated an improvement in manufacturing activity as well as expectations for further gains in factory production in the near term."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence contains information about "expectations for further gains in factory production in the near term," which directly implies a projection or anticipation of future events or trends.

2. **Justification**: The presence of "expectations for further gains" indicates that the sentence is discussing anticipated future developments, making it forward-looking.

Therefore, the output should be:
