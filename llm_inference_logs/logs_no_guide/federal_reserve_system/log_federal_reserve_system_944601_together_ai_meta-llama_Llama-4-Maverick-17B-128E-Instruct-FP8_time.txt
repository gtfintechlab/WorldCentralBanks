A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "both core and overall pce price inflation were expected to be damped by low rates of resource utilization, falling import prices, and easing cost pressures as a result of the sharp net declines in oil and other raw materials prices since last summer."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence discusses expectations regarding future inflation rates based on certain conditions. The use of "were expected to be damped" indicates a projection or forecast about future economic conditions.

The sentence is: "but as suggested by the rise until recently in profit margins, businesses had been able to realize productivity gains that tended to offset the faster increases in compensation costs."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence discusses past observations and trends ("the rise until recently in profit margins," "businesses had been able to realize productivity gains") without directly indicating future actions or expectations of the Federal Reserve or the economy. Therefore, it is not directly looking forward to future monetary policy decisions or economic conditions in a predictive manner.

The sentence is: "speeches by federal reserve officials, the minutes of the march meeting, and congressional testimony by the chairman combined to restrain policy expectations some."

First, we need to understand what "forward looking" means in the context of monetary policy discussions. Forward-looking statements or analyses are those that imply or directly discuss future actions, expectations, or outcomes related to monetary policy.

The given sentence mentions "policy expectations," which directly relates to how market participants or the public anticipate the Federal Reserve will act in the future regarding monetary policy. The actions mentioned (speeches,

The sentence is: "in this regard, members referred to earlier unsustainable rates of investment by many high-tech firms that were now obliged to retrench despite still high rates of growth in the demand for their products and services."

This sentence discusses past actions and current conditions of high-tech firms, referencing "earlier unsustainable rates of investment" and the current state of "still high rates of growth in the demand for their products and services."

The sentence is: "market-based measures of inflation compensation have declined; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed."

First, we need to understand what "forward looking" means in the context of economic or monetary policy discussions. Forward-looking statements or analyses are those that pertain to or are relevant for the future. They often involve expectations, forecasts, or predictions about future economic conditions or the effects of current decisions.

The given sentence discusses two types of measures related to inflation: "market-based measures of inflation compensation" and "survey-based measures of longer-term inflation

The sentence is: "average hourly earnings for all employees increased 2 percent over the 12 months ending in february."

1. **Understanding the task**: We need to determine if the sentence is "forward looking" or "not forward looking" in the context of the Federal Reserve System's monetary policy meeting. "Forward looking" typically refers to statements or information that indicate future expectations, predictions, or guidance.

2. **Analyzing the sentence**: The sentence reports on a past event or statistic, specifically the increase in average hourly earnings over the 12 months ending in

The sentence is: "outlays on drilling and mining structures continued to climb in the first quarter, and available data pointed to ongoing growth."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence discusses past trends ("continued to climb") and indicates a continuation or expectation of these trends into the future ("pointed to ongoing growth"). The phrase "pointed to ongoing growth" suggests a projection or expectation beyond the current or past state, indicating a forward-looking aspect.

2. **Justification**: The sentence is considered forward looking because it implies that the growth is expected to continue beyond the first
2025-04-14 23:48:56,300 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and context.

The sentence discusses the "staff economic outlook" and a "forecast for real GDP growth" in the context of a projection prepared for the March FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) meeting.
