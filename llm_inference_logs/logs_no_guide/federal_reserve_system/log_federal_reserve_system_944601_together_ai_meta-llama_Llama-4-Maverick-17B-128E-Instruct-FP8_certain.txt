A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "both core and overall pce price inflation were expected to be damped by low rates of resource utilization, falling import prices, and easing cost pressures as a result of the sharp net declines in oil and other raw materials prices since last summer."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence is discussing expectations regarding future economic conditions (inflation rates) based on certain factors (resource utilization, import prices, cost pressures, and raw materials prices). The use of "were expected" indicates a prediction or forecast rather than a statement of fact.

2. **Justification

The sentence is: "but as suggested by the rise until recently in profit margins, businesses had been able to realize productivity gains that tended to offset the faster increases in compensation costs."

This sentence discusses a past ability of businesses to offset compensation costs through productivity gains, as indicated by rising profit margins until recently. The key phrases to focus on for uncertainty are "as suggested by" and "tended to offset," which indicate a degree of inference and a tendency rather than a certainty.

Given this analysis, the classification would be as follows:

The sentence is: "votes for this action: messrs. greenspan, mcdonough, ferguson, gramlich, hoenig, jordan, kelley, mcteer, meyer, and mses."

Let's break it down:

1. The sentence is stating a fact about the votes for a specific action during a meeting.
2. It lists the names of individuals who voted for the action.

Given that the sentence is reporting a factual outcome of a vote without expressing any doubt or ambiguity, it is stating something that has occurred with

The key phrases to focus on are "was expected to be supported" and "still-accommodative monetary policy." The use of "was expected" indicates a prediction or anticipation rather than a certainty.

The sentence is: "the manager pro tem turned next to a review of money market developments and open market desk operations."

This sentence is reporting on an action that took place, specifically what the manager pro tem did during a meeting or a discussion. The language used is factual and does not express any doubt, speculation, or uncertainty about the action or the event being described.

Given the factual nature of the sentence, it is reasonable to classify it as "certain" because it reports on an action without expressing any ambiguity or doubt.

Here's the output following the required structure:

The sentence states: "a number of the term securities lending facility (tslf) auctions were oversubscribed, as was the auction of options for 13-day schedule 2 tslf loans straddling the end of the year."

This sentence reports on a specific event or outcome related to the Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF) auctions without expressing doubt or speculation about the event. The language used is factual and indicates that certain auctions were oversubscribed, which is a verifiable fact.

Therefore, the classification should be based on the certainty of the statement.
2025-04-14 23:48:22,509 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "some members also noted that any adjustment of these ranges to align them more fully with projections of money growth consistent with the committee's expectations for expansion of the economy and prices in 1996 could be misinterpreted."

This sentence implies a potential outcome or interpretation ("could be misinterpreted") rather than stating a fact or a definitive outcome. The use of "could be misinterpreted" introduces uncertainty because it suggests a possibility rather than a certainty.

The sentence is: "owing to the limited availability of agency debt and concerns that larger purchases could impair market functioning, the committee's transactions in these instruments for some time had been on a trajectory that would leave total purchases somewhat below the previously established maximum."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence discusses the committee's actions and their consequences in a factual manner but implies a condition or a projection ("would leave total purchases somewhat below the previously established maximum") rather than a definitive outcome. The use of "somewhat below" and the conditional trajectory indicates a level of uncertainty.
