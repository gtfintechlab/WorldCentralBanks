A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

2025-04-14 09:59:56,347 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence according to the Bank of Canada's monetary policy stance, we need to analyze its content and implications for monetary policy.

The sentence mentions "downside risks to inflation" related to European sovereign debt and banking concerns, and weaker-than-projected Canadian household spending. The focus on downside risks, particularly the risk of weaker growth in household spending and potential negative impacts from European financial issues, suggests a cautious or accommodative stance rather than a tightening one.

Given this, the classification should reflect a leaning towards easing or maintaining a supportive monetary policy stance due to the identified risks.

2025-04-14 10:00:29,483 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence according to the Bank of Canada's monetary policy stance, let's analyze its content and implications.

The sentence states that exports are expected to remain below their pre-recession peak due to lower foreign demand and challenges such as the strong Canadian dollar. The mention of the "persistent strength of the Canadian dollar" can be associated with a dovish stance because a strong currency can dampen exports and economic growth, potentially leading to a more accommodative monetary policy to counteract these effects. The overall tone suggests concerns about economic growth rather than inflation or the need to tighten monetary policy.

Therefore, the classification is as follows:
