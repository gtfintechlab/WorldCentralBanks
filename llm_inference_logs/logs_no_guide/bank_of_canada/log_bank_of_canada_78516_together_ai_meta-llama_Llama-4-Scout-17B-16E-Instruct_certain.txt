A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence states a definitive decision about the monetary policy stance and the target for the overnight rate, indicating a certain outcome."
}
```

The sentence uses phrases like "remains appropriate" and "remains at 1 per cent", which indicate a sense of definiteness and confidence, suggesting that the outcome is certain.
2025-04-14 09:58:15,328 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'significantly larger than was expected' and 'somewhat later', which indicate uncertainty and variability in the prediction."
}
```

The sentence is classified as "uncertain" because it expresses a comparison to a previous expectation ("significantly larger than was expected") and uses a vague phrase ("somewhat later"), which implies a degree of uncertainty or unpredictability.
2025-04-14 09:58:15,328 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'projected' and 'consistent with', which indicate a degree of uncertainty or prediction rather than a statement of fact."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it expresses a projection or prediction about future wage growth, rather than a statement about current or past facts.
2025-04-14 09:58:15,328 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains the word 'expects', which indicates a prediction or forecast, implying uncertainty about future events."
}
```

The sentence expresses a prediction about future growth, which may or may not materialize, hence it is classified as uncertain.
2025-04-14 09:58:16,863 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{

2025-04-14 09:58:16,864 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a possibility that is contingent on future events, indicated by the phrase 'could turn out to be stronger than anticipated'."
}
```
2025-04-14 09:58:16,864 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a forecasted outcome using specific numbers and a clear timeframe, indicating a level of confidence and certainty."
}
```

However, upon re-reading, I realize that the sentence actually expresses a forecast with some conditionality ("is forecast to rise temporarily"), which might suggest some degree of uncertainty.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence uses phrases like 'forecast to rise' and 'temporarily', indicating some degree of uncertainty and conditionality."
}

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents a clear and definitive statement about the state of inflation expectations, without using words or phrases that indicate uncertainty, such as "may", "could", "suggests", or "it appears". The use of the word "have moved up" and "remain anchored" implies a level of confidence and definiteness, supporting the classification as certain.

  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'likely' and 'close to zero', indicating a degree of uncertainty or prediction rather than a definitive statement."
}
```

This classification is based on the presence of words that suggest a level of uncertainty or probability, rather than a statement of fact. The word "likely" and the phrase "close to zero" imply that the speaker is making a prediction or estimate, rather than stating a certainty.

{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a specific and factual outcome of the Bank of Canada's review, without expressing any doubt or ambiguity."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents a factual statement about the Bank of Canada's review and its results, without using words or phrases that indicate uncertainty, such as "may", "could", "likely", or "uncertain". The language used is descriptive and assertive, indicating a clear and definitive outcome.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence is a statement of fact about the Bank of Canada's future action, with no expression of doubt or ambiguity."
}
```

However, I can also argue that it is uncertain because it implies that the bank's future actions are dependent on the assessment of labour market data. Here is an alternative classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence implies that the Bank of Canada's future actions are conditional on the assessment of labour market data, introducing an element of uncertainty."
}

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a specific and concrete action being taken by the Bank of Canada, with no ambiguous language or conditional statements."
}
```

This sentence reports a definitive decision made by the Bank of Canada, without any expressions of doubt, possibility, or future uncertainty, which indicates that the information presented is certain.

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents a factual observation about the current state of the economy, without expressing any doubt or uncertainty. The use of specific numbers and data ("two-thirds of CPI components increasing more than 5%") contributes to the certainty of the statement.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports historical facts about the Canadian economy's state before and after the COVID-19 outbreak, without expressing any doubt or uncertainty."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it states verifiable facts about the past, without using words or phrases that indicate uncertainty, such as "may", "could", "likely", or "it is expected that". The sentence simply reports what happened to the Canadian economy, making it a statement of fact rather than an uncertain prediction or opinion.
