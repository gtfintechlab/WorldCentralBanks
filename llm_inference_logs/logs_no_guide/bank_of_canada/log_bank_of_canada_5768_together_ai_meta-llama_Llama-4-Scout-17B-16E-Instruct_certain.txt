A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'forecast' and 'gradually', which indicate a degree of uncertainty or prediction rather than a statement of fact."
}
```

The sentence is classified as uncertain because it expresses a prediction or forecast about future events (inflation easing) rather than stating a current fact.
2025-04-14 09:52:45,676 - together_inference - INFO - Response: {
"label": "certain",
"justification": "The sentence describes a current situation using verifiable data and facts, without expressing doubt or ambiguity."
} 

However, I can also make a case for it being uncertain, given that it involves predictions about economic trends and uncontrollable events. 

{
"label": "uncertain",
"justification": "The sentence involves predictions and factors that are subject to change, such as 'robust demand', 'supply shocks', and 'geopolitical events', which introduce uncertainty."
} 

Upon reevaluation, I think the better classification would be:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'will depend' and 'expected', which indicate a degree of uncertainty or unpredictability."
}
```

The sentence is classified as uncertain because it expresses a conditional or predicted outcome that may not be entirely known or fixed, indicated by phrases such as "will depend" and "it is expected".
2025-04-14 09:52:45,676 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'expected' and 'moderate', which indicate a degree of uncertainty or prediction rather than a statement of fact."
}
```

This sentence is classified as uncertain because it expresses a prediction or expectation about future economic behavior, rather than stating a known or certain fact.
2025-04-14 09:52:45,676 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses potential risks and possibilities, using phrases such as 'the possibility that' and 'could be weaker than projected', indicating uncertainty."
}
```

This sentence is classified as uncertain because it discusses potential risks and possibilities, rather than stating facts or certainties. The use of phrases like "the possibility that" and "could be weaker than projected" suggests that the outcomes are not guaranteed, which is a hallmark of uncertainty.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains the word 'anticipated', implying a comparison to expectations, which introduces uncertainty."

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence presents a specific forecast from the July MPR projection, indicating a clear expectation about future inflation rates."
}
```

Although the sentence refers to a future event (inflation rates in 2025), it is phrased in a way that suggests a high degree of confidence in the forecast, using phrases like "is forecast to hover" and providing specific numbers. This suggests that the sentence is making a statement about a predicted outcome with a relatively high level of certainty, rather than expressing uncertainty or doubt.
2025-04-14 09:52:48,853 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific data point about price pressures, indicating a clear and verifiable state of affairs."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents a factual observation about the state of price pressures, citing a specific statistic (two-thirds of CPI components increasing more than 5% over the past year), which implies a level of objective certainty.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a forecasted outcome using specific numbers and a clear timeframe, indicating a level of confidence and certainty."

However, upon re-reading, I realize that the sentence actually expresses a forecast, which implies some level of uncertainty. Here is the revised classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a forecast or prediction, using words like 'forecast' and 'temporarily', indicating some level of uncertainty."

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses uncertainty through phrases such as 'weaker than expected', indicating a deviation from a predicted or expected outcome."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "uncertain" because it contains phrases that imply a degree of unpredictability or variation from expectations, such as "weaker than expected". This suggests that the outcome was not certain or guaranteed, but rather subject to some degree of uncertainty.

  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words and phrases with uncertain or probabilistic language, such as 'projected', 'likely', and 'about', which indicate a degree of uncertainty."
}
```

This sentence is classified as uncertain because it uses language that suggests a range of possible outcomes rather than a definitive statement. The use of words like "projected", "likely", and "about" implies a degree of uncertainty or imprecision, which supports the classification as uncertain.

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it uses phrases like "is evolving broadly as expected" and states specific economic trends (e.g., "pickup in core inflation was largely offset by lower energy prices") in a matter-of-fact way, indicating that the information is presented as factual rather than speculative or uncertain.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence uses phrases like 'a range of indicators suggest' and 'approaching balance', which imply a degree of uncertainty and ambiguity rather than a definitive statement."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it uses cautious language, such as "suggest" and "approaching balance", which indicates that the outcome is not yet clear or definitive.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'expected' and 'surprised' that indicate a degree of uncertainty or unpredictability about future economic trends."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it expresses a prediction or expectation about future economic developments, rather than stating a fact with complete confidence. The use of words like "expected" and "surprised" implies that there is some degree of uncertainty or unpredictability about how the economies will evolve.
