A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "in this context, governing council will remain cautious with respect to future policy adjustments, guided by incoming data."

Let's break it down:

1. The phrase "governing council will remain cautious" indicates a future state or intention.
2. The phrase "with respect to future policy adjustments" directly points towards future actions or decisions.
3. The phrase "guided by incoming data" suggests that the future actions will be based on data that will be received

The sentence is: "the bank now expects the economy’s return to above-potential growth to be delayed until the second quarter of 2016."

1. **Understanding the task**: We need to determine if the sentence is "forward looking" or "not forward looking" based on its content and the context of the Bank of Canada's monetary policy meeting.

2. **Analyzing the sentence**: The sentence mentions "the bank now expects," which indicates a current expectation or forecast. It is discussing the economy's future performance, specifically when it is expected to return to "
2025-04-14 10:01:57,141 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and context.

The sentence is: "while price differentials have narrowed in recent weeks following announced mandatory production cuts in alberta, investment in canada’s oil sector is projected to weaken further."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence contains the phrase "is projected to weaken further," which indicates a prediction or expectation about a future event or condition.

2. **Justification**: The presence of "is projected to weaken further" signifies that the statement is making a prediction about the future state of investment in Canada's oil sector.

Therefore, the output should be:

The sentence is: "the canadian economy has been resilient but indicators since the october monetary policy report (mpr) have been mixed."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence discusses the current state of the Canadian economy and the mixed indicators since the last monetary policy report. It doesn't directly state future actions or expectations that would influence future decisions. However, it implies a review of past data which could inform future decisions indirectly.

2. **Analysis**: The key phrases are "has been resilient" and "indicators have been mixed." The first phrase looks back at the

The sentence is discussing a trend related to US inflation. The phrase "looks to have resumed" indicates an observation about a recent development or a past trend that is being assessed. It does not directly predict or imply a future action or state beyond stating a current or past observation.

However, discussing a trend, especially one that "resumed its downward path," can imply an expectation or a potential future direction, even if it's based on past data. Yet, the primary
