A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

This sentence is classified as "certain" because it explicitly states that the Bank of Canada "has decided" to maintain the target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent, indicating a clear and definitive decision.
2025-04-14 10:03:50,183 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words and phrases that indicate a degree of uncertainty or prediction, such as 'expected to', 'gradually', and 'remain moderate'."
}
```

The sentence is classified as "uncertain" because it expresses a forecast or prediction about future events, rather than stating a fact. The use of words and phrases like "expected to", "gradually", and "remain moderate" indicate a degree of uncertainty or unpredictability, suggesting that the outcome is not guaranteed.

```

The sentence expresses a forecast or prediction about future inflation, which inherently involves uncertainty. The use of words like "expected", "gradually", and conditional phrases ("as the drag... dissipates and demand recovers") suggests that the outcome is not guaranteed, making the sentence uncertain.

  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific projection made by the bank, indicating a definitive expectation about future economic growth."

Note that while the sentence does contain some vague language ("just over", "about"), the overall tone and structure suggest that the bank has made a clear and specific projection, which implies a level of certainty. However, I can also see how one could argue that the use of vague language ("just over", "about") introduces some uncertainty. If you'd like, I can revisit my classification!

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains conditional phrases ('are able to contain', 'will be avoided') that indicate uncertainty about future events."

This classification is based on the presence of words and phrases that suggest doubt or unpredictability about the outcomes of the European crisis and the U.S. fiscal cliff.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words and phrases that indicate uncertainty, such as 'will boost', 'around', and 'converges', which suggest a degree of unpredictability."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it contains language that implies a degree of uncertainty or unpredictability, such as "will boost", "around", and "converges". These words suggest that the outcome is not entirely predictable, which is a characteristic of uncertain language.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific and definitive action taken by the Bank of Canada regarding its interest rates, with no expressions of doubt or ambiguity."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "certain" because it states a clear and factual decision made by the Bank of Canada, without any indication of uncertainty or potential change. The use of specific numbers and a definitive statement ("held its target") supports this classification.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'expected' and 'gradually', which indicate a degree of uncertainty and unpredictability about the future state of Canada's economy."
}
```

This sentence is classified as uncertain because it expresses a prediction or expectation about the future, rather than stating a fact. The use of words like "expected" and "gradually" suggests that the outcome is not guaranteed, but rather a probable or hoped-for result.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a specific and observable phenomenon in financial markets, indicating a clear and certain effect."
}

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'expected' and 'a little later than was expected', indicating some degree of uncertainty or unpredictability."

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'judges' and 'roughly balanced' that imply a degree of uncertainty and subjectivity in the Bank of Canada's assessment."
}
```

The sentence is classified as "uncertain" because it expresses a judgment rather than a statement of fact, and the use of "roughly balanced" suggests a degree of imprecision.

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents a statement that can be verified or observed, and there are no words or phrases that indicate uncertainty, such as "may", "could", "likely", or "uncertain". The language used is factual and descriptive, suggesting that the situation is clear and known.

{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'expected' and 'restraining' that indicate a degree of uncertainty or prediction, rather than a statement of fact."

```

The sentence is classified as uncertain because it expresses a prediction or expectation about future economic growth, and uses words that imply a degree of doubt or unpredictability.
2025-04-14 10:04:25,905 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a factual situation using present-tense verbs and assertive language, indicating a statement of fact rather than a uncertain or speculative one."
}
```

However, upon re-reading, I realize that the sentence contains some words that imply uncertainty, such as "robust demand... is driving" and "being further reinforced", but especially "recent geopolitical events" which might not have a predictable outcome.

So, I revise my answer:
