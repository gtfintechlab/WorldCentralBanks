A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence describes current factors driving commodity prices, without referencing future events or projections."
}
```

This sentence is not forward looking because it discusses current and past factors (robust demand, supply shocks from recent geopolitical events) that are influencing commodity prices, rather than making statements about future expectations or projections.

This sentence is classified as "forward looking" because it discusses expected future events, specifically the moderation of consumption this year, which implies a projection or prediction about what will happen in the future.
2025-04-14 09:53:34,679 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses potential future risks to inflation, specifically mentioning possibilities that could materialize, indicating a forward-looking perspective."

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a potential future risk associated with household imbalances, indicating a forward-looking perspective."
}
```

The sentence is classified as "forward looking" because it uses the phrase "edging higher", which suggests a trend or movement that is ongoing and may continue into the future, and "risks associated" which implies a potential future outcome.

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses potential future risks to inflation, specifically the possibility of weaker growth in Canadian household spending and a reintensification of sovereign debt and banking concerns in Europe."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "forward looking" because it discusses potential future risks and possibilities, indicating a focus on what may happen in the future rather than current or past events.
2025-04-14 09:53:45,307 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence primarily discusses the current state of the economy and compares it to past projections, rather than making statements about future economic prospects or policy intentions."
}
```

Although the sentence mentions that the rotation of demand is "somewhat slower than had been anticipated", which implies a comparison to previous expectations, the overall focus is on describing the current economic situation rather than outlining future expectations or prospects, which is why I classified it as "not forward looking".

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses future uncertainties and adjustments that will impact growth, indicating a forward-looking perspective."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "forward looking" because it mentions future events and factors that will influence growth, such as the unwinding of temporary factors and continuing adjustments, which implies a focus on what is to come rather than current or past events.

  "justification": "The sentence describes the current state of global financial conditions and does not express a prediction or projection about future events or economic indicators."

```

This sentence is not forward looking because it only reports on the current situation, using phrases such as "has resurfaced" and "are under stress" and "remain accommodative", which describe the present state of affairs without expressing a view on what is likely to happen in the future.
