A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

2025-04-14 09:55:22,276 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "while inflation is still above central bank targets in most advanced economies, it is forecast to ease gradually."

1. **Label Assignment**: The key phrase here is "it is forecast to ease gradually." The use of "forecast" indicates a prediction rather than a statement of fact. This suggests that the sentence is expressing uncertainty about future events.

2. **Justification**: The sentence is classified as "uncertain" because it contains the word "forecast," which implies a prediction or expectation about future inflation trends rather than a certainty.

Therefore, the output is
2025-04-14 09:55:22,276 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "robust demand from emerging-market economies is driving the underlying strength in commodity prices, which is being further reinforced by supply shocks arising from recent geopolitical events."

First, we observe that the sentence makes a statement about the current state of commodity prices and the factors influencing them. It attributes the strength in commodity prices to "robust demand from emerging-market economies" and "supply shocks arising from recent geopolitical events." The language used is assertive, indicating a clear cause-and-effect relationship.

However, the certainty of the statement can be questioned based on the predictability and stability
2025-04-14 09:55:22,277 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and structure.

The sentence is: "while its economic impact will depend on how quickly this wave passes, it is expected to be less severe than previous waves."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence contains phrases that indicate a level of uncertainty or conditionality regarding the economic impact ("will depend on how quickly this wave passes") and a projection ("it is expected to be less severe"), which suggests that the outcome is not definitive.

2. **Justification**: The presence of "will depend on" and "it is expected" indicates that the statement is based on a prediction or expectation rather
2025-04-14 09:55:22,277 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "as more households renew their mortgages at higher rates and restrictive monetary policy works its way through the economy more broadly, consumption is expected to moderate this year."

1. **Label Assignment**: The key phrases to focus on are "is expected to" and the overall context of predicting future economic behavior based on current conditions. The phrase "is expected to" indicates a forecast or prediction rather than a statement of fact.

2. **Justification**: The use of "is expected to" suggests that the outcome (consumption moderating) is anticipated based on current
2025-04-14 09:55:22,277 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence discusses "downside risks to inflation in Canada" and lists specific factors, including "sovereign debt concerns in Europe," "the persistent strength of the Canadian dollar," and "the possibility that growth in Canadian household spending could be weaker than projected." The mention of "risks" and "possibility" indicates a discussion about potential future events or outcomes that are not guaranteed.

Given this analysis, the sentence is discussing uncertainties or potential risks rather than stating facts or certainties. Therefore, the classification should reflect the uncertain nature of the events being discussed.

The sentence states: "recent higher inflation is attributable to the temporary effects of higher energy prices, exchange rate pass-through and other sector-specific shocks, rather than to any change in domestic economic fundamentals."

This sentence is making a clear attribution of the cause of recent higher inflation to specific factors (temporary effects of higher energy prices, exchange rate pass-through, and sector-specific shocks) and explicitly rules out another potential cause (change in domestic economic fundamentals). The language used is assertive and does not contain hedging or speculative elements that would indicate uncertainty.

Therefore, the classification is as follows:
