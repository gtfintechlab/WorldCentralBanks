A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

2025-04-14 23:12:49,196 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The mention of decreasing long-term rates in domestic currency suggests an accommodative monetary policy stance, which is characteristic of a dovish tone."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that a dovish monetary policy stance is typically associated with lower interest rates, which can stimulate economic growth. The sentence's mention of decreasing long-term rates suggests that the Central Reserve Bank of Peru is taking a dovish stance to support the economy.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a factual situation regarding upward pressures on the interbank rate without expressing a clear stance on monetary policy, thus it is neutral."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply reports on market conditions and their possible cause (income tax payments), without indicating any intention to tighten or loosen monetary policy, which would be characteristic of a hawkish or dovish stance, respectively.

  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual report on core inflation without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance or expressing a clear concern about inflation, suggesting a neutral tone."
}
```

This sentence simply reports a fact about core inflation without expressing any concern or indicating a need for policy action, which suggests a neutral stance. There is no indication of a hawkish (concerned about inflation and potentially raising interest rates) or dovish (concerned about growth and potentially lowering interest rates) tone.
2025-04-14 23:12:49,196 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a balanced view, acknowledging both inflation concerns and growth considerations, without indicating a clear inclination towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
}
```

The sentence implies that the Central Reserve Bank of Peru is taking a wait-and-see approach, considering both the transitory nature of inflation and the economy's growth rate being close to its potential. This balanced perspective is characteristic of a neutral monetary policy stance.
2025-04-14 23:12:50,618 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The significant liquidity injection operations by the Central Reserve Bank of Peru indicate an accommodative monetary policy stance, which is characteristic of a dovish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the Central Reserve Bank of Peru's liquidity injection operations totaled S 61.7 billion, which suggests that the bank is taking measures to stimulate the economy by providing more liquidity, a typical dovish monetary policy stance.
2025-04-14 23:12:50,618 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides factual information about inflation rates without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance, hence it is neutral."
}
```

The sentence simply reports on the current state of inflation, citing specific rates, without expressing a view that would suggest a tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) of monetary policy, nor does it seem unrelated (irrelevant) to monetary policy discussions. Therefore, it is classified as neutral.
2025-04-14 23:12:50,618 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The central bank's decision to lower the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations indicates a loosening of monetary policy, which is a dovish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that lowering interest rates is a typical expansionary monetary policy move, which is often associated with a dovish stance.
2025-04-14 23:12:50,618 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a positive economic outlook without mentioning any specific policy actions or changes in interest rates, indicating a neutral stance."

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The mention of expected inflation being slightly above the upper limit of the inflation target range suggests a concern about inflationary pressures, which is a hawkish stance."
}
```

This classification indicates that the sentence has a hawkish tone, implying that the Central Reserve Bank of Peru may be inclined to tighten monetary policy to combat inflationary pressures.
2025-04-14 23:12:52,015 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The decision to maintain the interest rates at 5.75 percent indicates a neutral stance, as it implies no change in the monetary policy settings."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence mentions the decision to "maintain" the interest rates, which implies no change or a status quo, characteristic of a neutral monetary policy stance.
2025-04-14 23:12:52,015 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence focuses on inflation being within the target range, indicating no immediate concern for tightening or loosening monetary policy."
}
```

The sentence provides a factual update on inflation rates and their position relative to the target range, without suggesting any inclination towards increasing or decreasing interest rates, which is characteristic of a neutral stance.
2025-04-14 23:12:52,015 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual explanation for the inflation rate without implying any specific policy action or tone, indicating a neutral stance."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply explains the factors contributing to inflation without expressing a clear policy bias or suggesting a specific course of action, which is characteristic of a neutral monetary policy stance.
2025-04-14 23:12:52,015 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a moderation in global economic activity and lower inflationary pressures, which could justify a more accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

The reasoning behind this classification is that the sentence's tone implies a potential easing of monetary policy, which is characteristic of a dovish stance. The mention of lower inflationary pressures and moderated economic activity suggests that the Central Reserve Bank of Peru might consider cutting interest rates or maintaining a loose monetary policy, which aligns with a dovish monetary policy stance.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence is neutral as it simply reports a factual observation about economic activity without implying any specific policy action or bias."
}
```

The sentence does not suggest that the Central Reserve Bank of Peru will tighten (hawkish) or loosen (dovish) monetary policy, but rather presents a neutral, factual observation about economic activity. Therefore, I classify it as "neutral".
2025-04-14 23:12:53,481 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The central bank's decision to maintain the interest and commission rates used in domestic-currency central bank operations suggests a neutral stance, as it implies no change in the current monetary policy settings."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence indicates that the central bank is maintaining the status quo, without introducing any new measures that would suggest a shift towards a more hawkish (tightening) or dovish (loosening) stance.
2025-04-14 23:12:53,481 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The Central Reserve Bank of Peru raised the reference rate to 2.0%, indicating a tightening of monetary policy, which is a hawkish stance."
}
```

Although the sentence mentions that the measure "implies maintaining monetary stimulus" and that "no inflationary pressures are observed", the fact that the bank raised the reference rate suggests a move towards a more restrictive monetary policy, which is characteristic of a hawkish stance.
2025-04-14 23:12:53,481 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a minor change in inflation rate, which does not suggest a significant shift in monetary policy stance."
}
```

The sentence simply reports a small decrease in inflation rate from 1.8% to 1.7%, which does not provide enough information to suggest a hawkish (tightening) or dovish (loosening) stance. Therefore, the label is classified as "neutral".
2025-04-14 23:12:53,481 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence highlights the significant increase in global inflation and its deviation from central banks' targets, suggesting a concern for inflation that is typically associated with a hawkish monetary policy stance."
}
```

This sentence does not explicitly mention the Central Reserve Bank of Peru's monetary policy, but the context suggests that the description of global inflationary pressures could lead to a hawkish interpretation, implying that the bank might be concerned about inflation and potentially inclined to tighten monetary policy.

2025-04-14 23:12:55,164 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The decrease in expected inflation suggests a reduced need for tight monetary policy, which is a dovish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the idea that a decrease in expected inflation, especially to a level closer to the typical inflation target of central banks (around 2% or lower), may lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance, which is characterized as dovish.
2025-04-14 23:12:55,164 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The Central Reserve Bank of Peru's decision to reduce the reference rate by 25 bps to 7.25 percent indicates a loosening of monetary policy, which is a dovish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that a rate cut is a dovish move, as it aims to stimulate economic growth and ease monetary conditions.
2025-04-14 23:12:55,164 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence simply reports an expected inflation rate without implying any change in monetary policy or expressing a clear stance on inflation, indicating a neutral tone."
}
```

This sentence does not convey a clear stance on monetary policy, nor does it suggest that the Central Reserve Bank of Peru will take a specific action to address inflation. The expected inflation rate of 2.5 percent is reported as a fact, without any emotional tone or implication of future policy changes, which is why I classify it as "neutral".
2025-04-14 23:12:55,164 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence is merely an announcement of a meeting and a procedural step, without any indication of a specific monetary policy stance."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence does not convey any information that would suggest a tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) of monetary policy, and instead appears to be a routine announcement.
2025-04-14 23:12:55,164 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a forecast for the daily average balance of banks' deposits held at the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply provides a forecast without suggesting any tightening or loosening of monetary policy, which is a neutral stance.

2025-04-14 23:12:56,763 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance of the given sentence, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Understanding the Context**: The sentence discusses the performance of public expenditure and its impact on the gap between economic activity and its potential level of growth in the fourth quarter of 2017.

2. **Identifying Key Elements**: 
   - The sentence mentions that public expenditure, particularly investment expenditure, grew less than forecast.
   - This underperformance led to an increase in the gap between economic activity and its potential level of growth.

3. **Interpreting Monetary Policy Stance**:
   - **Hawkish**: Implies a concern about inflation
2025-04-14 23:12:56,763 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions that core inflation remains around the 2 percent target, indicating a neutral stance as it suggests that the current monetary policy is on track to meet its inflation goal."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence presents a neutral tone, highlighting that the inflation rate is within the target range, which implies that the Central Reserve Bank of Peru's monetary policy is achieving its objectives, and therefore, no extreme actions (hawkish or dovish) are required at this moment.
2025-04-14 23:12:56,763 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a positive outlook on inflation trending towards the target range, implying a potential easing of monetary policy, which is a dovish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence presents a optimistic view of inflation decreasing and getting closer to the target range, which could indicate that the Central Reserve Bank of Peru might adopt a more accommodative monetary policy, characteristic of a dovish stance.

2025-04-14 23:12:58,353 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides factual information about inflation rates without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance, thus maintaining a neutral tone."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence simply reports on the current state of inflation without suggesting any actions or changes in the monetary policy that would indicate a hawkish (tightening) or dovish (loosening) stance. Therefore, it is considered neutral.
2025-04-14 23:12:58,353 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual update on inflation rates without indicating a change in the monetary policy stance, hence a neutral tone."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply reports on the current state of inflation without expressing a clear intention to tighten (hawkish) or loosen (dovish) monetary policy. The focus is on describing the situation rather than announcing a policy shift.
2025-04-14 23:12:58,354 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that the Central Reserve Bank of Peru is willing to expand monetary stimulus, indicating a tendency to loosen monetary policy, which is a dovish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence mentions "expand the monetary stimulus when appropriate", which implies that the bank is open to taking measures to stimulate the economy, a characteristic of a dovish monetary policy stance.
2025-04-14 23:12:58,354 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The mention of increased inflation expectations reaching similar rates to the upper bound of the inflation target range suggests a concern for inflation, which is a hawkish stance."
}
```

The reasoning behind this classification is that the sentence highlights concerns about inflation expectations, which is a typical concern for a hawkish monetary policy stance. There is no mention of economic growth or stimulus, which are typically associated with dovish stances, and the tone is cautious, rather than neutral. Therefore, the sentence can be classified as having a hawkish tone
2025-04-14 23:12:58,354 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence highlights increased economic risks and volatility due to COVID-19, suggesting a need for accommodative monetary policy, which is a dovish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the context that a dovish monetary policy stance is typically associated with a focus on economic growth and stability, often in response to economic downturns or increased uncertainty. The sentence's emphasis on accentuated risks and increased volatility implies a concern for economic stability, which aligns with a dovish approach.

2025-04-14 23:13:04,907 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance based on the given sentence, let's analyze it step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the context
The sentence discusses inflation rates excluding food and energy, providing specific percentages for the rate and the accumulated annual rate.

## 2: Identify key information
The inflation rate mentioned is 0.12 percent, and the accumulated annual rate is 1.80 percent. Typically, low inflation rates suggest that the economy is not overheating.

## 3: Relate to monetary policy stances
- **Hawkish** refers to a monetary policy stance that is focused on controlling inflation, often implying
2025-04-14 23:13:04,907 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The reduction of the reference rate, influenced by low monthly inflation rates, indicates an accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that a reduction in the reference rate is typically a dovish or expansionary monetary policy move, aimed at stimulating economic activity. The low inflation rates mentioned in the sentence provide a justification for such a move, further supporting the dovish classification.
2025-04-14 23:13:04,907 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence simply states a fact about inflation declining in line with forecasts, without indicating a change in monetary policy or a bias towards tightening or easing."
}
```

This sentence does not convey a hawkish (concerned about inflation and potentially raising interest rates) or dovish (concerned about growth and potentially lowering interest rates) tone, but rather a neutral tone, as it merely reports on the current state of inflation without implying any future policy actions.
2025-04-14 23:13:04,907 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual explanation for inflation being above the target range, attributing it to supply shocks, without indicating a change in monetary policy or a value judgment that would suggest a hawkish or dovish stance."
}
```
2025-04-14 23:13:04,908 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The Central Reserve Bank of Peru maintains the reference interest rate, but expresses concerns about potential inflationary pressures, indicating a balanced stance."
}
```

Although the bank expresses concerns about inflationary pressures, the decision to maintain the interest rate at its current level suggests that the bank is not taking a strong stance in either direction (hawkish or dovish), hence the classification as "neutral".

## Step 1: Understand the context of monetary policy stances
- "Hawkish" refers to a monetary policy stance that is focused on controlling inflation, often implying higher interest rates or a tightening of monetary policy.
- "Dovish" refers to a stance that prioritizes economic growth and employment, often implying lower interest rates or an easing of monetary policy.
- "Neutral" suggests a balanced approach, not favoring either tightening or easing, maintaining the current policy stance.
- "Irrelevant" would imply that

```
{

```

This sentence appears to be providing a neutral, factual forecast without any indication of a shift in monetary policy stance, hence the classification as "neutral".

I chose "neutral" because the sentence appears to be describing existing monetary policy operations and rules without indicating a shift towards a more hawkish (tightening) or dovish (loosening) stance. The language used is technical and descriptive, outlining the specifics of the policy rather than signaling a change in direction, which aligns with a neutral classification.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a neutral observation about business expectations without indicating any specific action or bias towards monetary policy tightening or loosening."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply reports on the improvement of business expectations without suggesting any implications for monetary policy, nor does it indicate a shift in the Central Reserve Bank of Peru's stance. 

Let me know if you have any further questions!

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that the measure is aimed at offsetting potential inflationary pressures, indicating a concern for inflation and a proactive stance to mitigate it."

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The statement balances various factors, including inflation expectations, GDP growth, and global economic recovery, without indicating a clear inclination towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
}
```

The sentence appears to be a careful balancing act, mentioning both positive and negative factors, and setting a reference rate that is compatible with an inflation forecast within the target range. There is no clear indication of a hawkish (tightening) or dovish (easing) stance, suggesting a neutral classification.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence is a neutral statement about the state of the economy and does not imply a specific direction for monetary policy."

## Step 1: Understand the context
The sentence discusses inflation rates excluding food and energy, providing a specific rate and an accumulated annual rate.

## Step 2: Identify key information
The inflation rate mentioned is 0.2 percent, and the accumulated annual rate is 2.02 percent.

## 3: Interpret the inflation rates
An inflation rate of 0.2 percent for the period and 2.02 percent annually suggests low inflation, close to or within target ranges that central banks often aim for (usually around

I classified the sentence as "neutral" because it implies that the monetary policy decision is based on a balanced assessment of the economy, with inflation being temporary and the economy growing at a rate close to its potential. There is no indication of a hawkish (tightening) or dovish (loosening) stance.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence reports on the flow of credit in soles, providing factual data without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance."

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The deterioration of business expectations indicators on GDP growth suggests that the Central Reserve Bank of Peru may adopt a more accommodative monetary policy stance to stimulate economic growth."
}
```

My reasoning is that a deterioration in business expectations indicators on GDP growth is a sign of economic weakness, which is typically associated with a dovish monetary policy stance, where the central bank is more likely to cut interest rates or implement other expansionary measures to boost the economy.
2025-04-14 23:13:20,267 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual observation about export prices without indicating any change in monetary policy or a clear bias towards tightening or easing."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply states a fact about the evolution of export prices without expressing a clear stance on monetary policy, nor does it suggest any inclination towards a more hawkish (tightening) or dovish (easing) policy.
2025-04-14 23:13:20,267 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions that inflation is declining and economic activity is lower than potential, suggesting a accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "dovish" because it highlights factors that would typically lead to a more accommodative monetary policy, such as declining inflation and lower-than-potential economic activity. This suggests that the Central Reserve Bank of Peru may be inclined to ease monetary policy or keep it loose, which is a dovish stance.
2025-04-14 23:13:20,267 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence reports on the exchange rate of the Nuevo Sol against the dollar, without mentioning any monetary policy decision or stance."
}
```

This sentence does not provide any information about the Central Reserve Bank of Peru's monetary policy stance, therefore it is classified as "irrelevant".
2025-04-14 23:13:20,267 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a willingness to act if necessary, but does not provide a clear indication of a tightening or loosening bias, implying a neutral stance."
}
```

The sentence does not contain strong language indicating a commitment to raise or lower interest rates, but rather a data-dependent approach to keep inflation within the target range. This flexibility and lack of a clear directional bias suggest a neutral monetary policy stance.

This classification is based on the fact that a rate cut is a expansionary monetary policy move, which is typically associated with a dovish stance. The sentence also mentions a downside bias to inflation due to lower domestic demand, which further supports a dovish interpretation.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides specific details about the interest rates for security currency repo and rediscount operations, but does not indicate a shift in the monetary policy stance, suggesting a neutral tone."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence appears to be describing a specific policy setting without indicating a change in the policy stance, which is a key characteristic of a neutral monetary policy communication. The sentence provides technical details about the interest rates for certain operations, but does not convey a hawkish (tightening) or dovish (loosening) tone.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a balanced view of the economy, noting both positive and negative factors, and does not indicate a clear inclination towards tightening or loosening monetary policy."
}
```

The sentence appears to be neutral because it:

* Notes that economic growth is close to its potential level
* Mentions that inflation expectations are within the target range
* Acknowledges temporary factors affecting inflation
* References uncertain international financial conditions

Overall, the tone is cautious and data-dependent, rather than advocating for a specific policy action, which is consistent with a neutral monetary

## Step 1: Understand the context
The sentence provided relates to the inflation rate excluding food and energy, registering a rate of 0.32 percent and an annual rate of 2.48 percent. This information is typically used by central banks, like the Central Reserve Bank of Peru, to assess inflationary pressures.

## 2: Interpret the inflation data
The inflation rate (2.48 percent annually) seems to be within or close to a target range, as central banks often aim for an inflation rate around 2 percent.

This classification is based on the fact that maintaining interest rates at their current level suggests that the Central Reserve Bank of Peru is not tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) its monetary policy, but rather keeping it steady, which is a neutral stance.

This sentence seems to be describing factors that influence inflation or price movements, but it does not provide any information about the Central Reserve Bank of Peru's monetary policy stance. Therefore, I classified it as "irrelevant".

{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The decline in inflation expectations suggests a less restrictive monetary policy stance, which is consistent with a dovish tone."
}
```

The reasoning behind this classification is that a decline in inflation expectations often leads to a more accommodative monetary policy stance, which is characteristic of a dovish tone. This indicates that the Central Reserve Bank of Peru might be more likely to implement expansionary monetary policies, such as lowering interest rates, to support economic growth.

This classification is based on the context that a hawkish monetary policy stance is characterized by a focus on controlling inflation, often implying a potential for interest rate hikes. The sentence's mention of rising inflation from 3.53% to 3.74% in a short period suggests that the Central Reserve Bank of Peru might be concerned about inflationary pressures, aligning with a

  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The Central Reserve Bank of Peru's decision to maintain a low reference rate of 0.25% and implement further liquidity injection operations indicates an accommodative or expansionary monetary policy stance."

```

The sentence is classified as "dovish" because it indicates that the central bank is taking actions to stimulate the economy, such as maintaining a low interest rate and injecting liquidity, which is consistent with a dovish or expansionary monetary policy stance.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates a wait-and-see approach, suggesting that the board is monitoring data before making any decisions, which is a neutral stance."

This sentence does not indicate a clear intention to tighten (hawkish) or loosen (dovish) monetary policy, but rather a willingness to consider changes based on incoming data, which is consistent with a neutral stance.
2025-04-14 23:13:34,106 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance based on the given sentence, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Understanding the Context**: The sentence discusses actions related to the spot market and exchange-related hedging operations by the Central Reserve Bank of Peru. Typically, such actions are part of monetary policy or foreign exchange management.

2. **Interpreting the Actions**:
   - A total of US$765 million were offered on the spot market. This action could be interpreted as an intervention to supply dollars, potentially to depreciate the local currency (Peruvian Sol) or to meet demand for foreign currency, which could be seen as supporting economic activity or managing
2025-04-14 23:13:34,106 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a forecast for the daily average balance of banks' deposits held at the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply provides a forecast without suggesting any tightening or loosening of monetary policy, which is a neutral stance.
2025-04-14 23:13:34,107 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a relaxed monetary policy stance as inflation is below the target range, suggesting no immediate need for tightening."
}
```

The reasoning behind this classification is that the sentence mentions inflation being below the lower band of the inflation target range, which could lead to a dovish monetary policy stance, as the central bank may consider easing policy to stimulate the economy.
2025-04-14 23:13:34,107 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The decrease in the average interbank interest rate from 2.77% to 2.71% suggests a loosening of monetary policy, which is a dovish stance."
}
```

This classification indicates that the sentence has a dovish tone, as it implies a slight easing of monetary policy.
