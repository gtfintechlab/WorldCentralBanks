A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

2025-04-14 23:05:29,955 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence discusses the Central Reserve Bank of Peru's benchmark rate in relation to an inflation forecast. It states that the current level of the benchmark rate is compatible with an inflation forecast where inflation remains within the target range during 2017. The forecast considers specific factors like the increase in prices of some food products and water tariffs in August having a transitory effect on inflation.

The key elements to consider for classification are the language and tone used in the sentence:

1. **Language and Tone**: The sentence is written in a formal and predictive tone, indicating a level of certainty about
2025-04-14 23:05:29,955 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze it step by step.

The sentence is: "as a result of this, inflation in the last 12 months rose from 3.53 percent in august to 3.74 percent in september".

1. **Understanding the task**: We need to determine if the sentence is certain or uncertain regarding the Central Reserve Bank of Peru's monetary policy meeting.

2. **Analyzing the sentence**: The sentence reports a factual change in inflation rates over a specific period. It states that inflation rose from 3.53% in August to 3.74% in September.

3. **Determining certainty
2025-04-14 23:05:29,955 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and context.

The sentence is: "in this month, the bcrp continued carrying out significative repo auctions in order to stabilize the interbank interest rate around the reference interest rate 4.0 percent in march."

First, we need to understand what the sentence is stating. It talks about an action taken by the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) during a specific month. The action is related to monetary policy, specifically conducting repo auctions to keep the interbank interest rate close to a reference rate of 4.0 percent.

To determine if the sentence is certain or
2025-04-14 23:05:29,955 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze it step by step.

The sentence is: "these measures have allowed to release immediately funds in domestic currency amounting to a total of 2 billion."

1. **Understanding the task**: We need to determine if the statement is certain or uncertain based on its content and the language used.

2. **Analyzing the sentence**: The sentence reports on an action that has been completed ("have allowed to release"). It states a specific outcome ("funds in domestic currency amounting to a total of 2 billion") as a result of "these measures."

3. **Determining certainty**: The language used
2025-04-14 23:05:29,955 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and implications.

The sentence is: "the central bank will continue to assess all relevant macroeconomic information to guarantee that the necessary measures are in place to maintain inflation within the target range."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence implies a future action ("will continue to assess") that is conditional on the assessment of macroeconomic information. It does not commit to a specific action but rather to a process. The phrase "to guarantee that the necessary measures are in place" suggests a conditionality or a future adjustment based on the assessment, which introduces an element of uncertainty regarding the specific measures that might be taken
