A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a decline in inflation, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance, indicating a dovish tone."
}
```

The reasoning behind this classification is that a decline in inflation, especially a consecutive decline over six months, might suggest that the Central Reserve Bank of Peru could consider easing monetary policy to stimulate economic growth, which is a dovish stance.

2025-04-14 23:07:23,561 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance based on the given sentence, "the latter rate was 5,5 percent," we need to understand what this information implies about the Central Reserve Bank of Peru's monetary policy.

Given that the sentence simply states a rate without any context of change, increase, decrease, or comparison to expectations or previous rates, and without explicit mention of future policy intentions, it's challenging to directly infer a hawkish (favoring higher interest rates to combat inflation), dovish (favoring lower interest rates to stimulate the economy), or neutral stance (no clear inclination towards tightening or loosening policy).

{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that price increases will not have a lasting impact on inflation as long as expectations remain aligned with the target, indicating a balanced view rather than a clear tightening or loosening bias."
}
```

This sentence does not indicate a clear hawkish (concerned about inflation and potentially raising interest rates) or dovish (concerned about growth and potentially lowering interest rates) stance. Instead, it seems to downplay the inflationary impact of recent rises, suggesting that as long as expectations are anchored to the inflation target, there
2025-04-14 23:07:23,561 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The statement implies a tolerant stance towards inflation exceeding the target range, suggesting a dovish monetary policy stance."
}
```

The sentence suggests that the Central Reserve Bank of Peru is willing to allow inflation to temporarily exceed the upper limit of the target range due to external shocks, which is a dovish stance. This implies that the bank is more focused on economic growth and stability than on strictly maintaining the inflation target.

  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The central bank's decision to raise the reference interest rate from 3.75 percent to 4.00 percent indicates a tightening of monetary policy, which is a hawkish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that a rate hike is typically considered a hawkish move, as it aims to curb inflation and slow down economic growth, indicating a more restrictive monetary policy stance.
2025-04-14 23:07:25,481 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence reports on the exchange rate and does not provide information about the Central Reserve Bank of Peru's monetary policy stance."
}
```

I chose "irrelevant" because the sentence only provides information about the exchange rate and does not mention any monetary policy decisions or hints about future policy actions, making it unrelated to the classification of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru's monetary policy stance.
2025-04-14 23:07:25,481 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions that inflation expectations remain within the target range, indicating no immediate concern for drastic policy changes, hence a neutral stance."
}
```

This sentence does not indicate a hawkish (concerned about inflation and potentially raising interest rates) or dovish (concerned about growth and potentially lowering interest rates) stance, but rather a neutral one, as the expectations are within the target range. The tone is informative and descriptive, without suggesting any specific policy action, which is why I classify it as neutral.

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence only announces the date of the next monetary policy session without providing any information about the monetary policy stance."
}
```

This sentence does not provide any information about the Central Reserve Bank of Peru's monetary policy stance, so it is classified as "irrelevant".
2025-04-14 23:07:25,481 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

}
```

I chose "neutral" because the statement mentions maintaining the current interest rate and presents a balanced view of inflation expectations, without signaling a need for immediate tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) of monetary policy.

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence only announces the date of the next monetary policy session without providing any information about the monetary policy stance."
}
```

This sentence does not provide any information about the Central Reserve Bank of Peru's monetary policy stance, so it is classified as "irrelevant".
2025-04-14 23:07:27,186 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that the inflation rate will remain around the lower limit of the target range for several months, implying a potentially accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

The reasoning behind this classification is that the sentence implies a relaxed view on inflation, which is consistent with a dovish monetary policy stance. The fact that the inflation rate is expected to remain around the lower limit of the target range for several months suggests that the central bank may not see a need to take immediate action to tighten policy, which is a dovish signal.
2025-04-14 23:07:27,186 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a schedule for approving monetary programs but does not convey a stance on monetary policy."
}
```

The sentence appears to be a neutral, factual statement about the schedule for approving monetary programs and does not express a clear stance on monetary policy, hence the classification as "irrelevant".
2025-04-14 23:07:27,186 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that inflation is expected to reach the target range, implying a neutral outlook on monetary policy, without indicating a need for tightening or loosening."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence does not suggest any deviation from the inflation target, nor does it imply that the Central Reserve Bank of Peru will take any specific action to adjust the monetary policy stance.

  "justification": "The sentence only announces the date of the next monetary policy session without providing any information about the monetary policy stance."

This sentence does not provide any information about the Central Reserve Bank of Peru's monetary policy stance, so it is classified as "irrelevant".
2025-04-14 23:07:32,167 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence simply announces a specific interest rate for monetary regulation credits without indicating a change in the policy stance or a deviation from the current strategy."
}
```

Note that the sentence appears to be an announcement of a specific policy rate, which does not provide enough information to classify it as hawkish (implying a tightening of monetary policy) or dovish (implying a loosening of monetary policy). Therefore, I classified it as neutral. 

However, if you want me to reevaluate, I can do that too.

1. **Understanding the Context**: The sentence mentions a benchmark announced for the year 2001, specifically a range of 130-145 million. This information seems to relate to a specific economic target or indicator, possibly related to monetary policy.

2. **Interpreting the Information**: Without a direct reference to interest rates, inflation, or other common monetary policy tools, we must infer the stance from the context. Typically, a "hawkish" stance implies a focus on controlling inflation, often through higher interest rates. A "dovish

2025-04-14 23:07:34,072 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance of the given sentence and provide a justification, let's analyze it step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Context
The sentence mentions a change in how the swap commission is calculated by the Central Reserve Bank of Peru, specifically that since October, it is calculated on a daily basis and considers international levels.

## 2: Determine the Implications of the Change
Calculating the swap commission on a daily basis and considering international levels could imply a more nuanced or flexible approach to managing monetary policy. This change might suggest that the bank is trying to align its policies with global standards or react more swiftly to financial market conditions

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The central bank's willingness to extend monetary stimulus suggests a accommodative monetary policy stance, which is characteristic of a dovish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the sentence indicating that the central bank is prepared to take further easing measures, which is a typical characteristic of a dovish monetary policy stance.

  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The increase in interest rates for direct repos and monetary regulation credits from 3.50 percent to 3.75 percent indicates a tightening of monetary policy, which is a hawkish stance."

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence simply reports a decision on interest rates without indicating a change or a significant shift in the monetary policy stance."
}
```

Note that the sentence only mentions a specific interest rate decision without providing context about whether it's an increase, decrease, or no change, which makes it seem like a neutral or a factual report rather than a clear indication of a hawkish (more aggressive tightening) or dovish (more accommodative) stance. Therefore, the most appropriate classification is "neutral".

{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The Central Reserve Bank of Peru's decision to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency indicates a neutral stance, as it implies no change in the current monetary policy."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "neutral" because the decision to maintain interest rates unchanged suggests that the central bank is not shifting its monetary policy stance, neither towards tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish).
2025-04-14 23:07:40,873 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates that the Central Reserve Bank of Peru maintained the reference rate at 5.75%, which suggests no change in the monetary policy stance, hence a neutral classification."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence only mentions maintaining the current interest rate, without any indication of a rate hike (which would be hawkish) or a rate cut (which would be dovish). Therefore, the monetary policy stance can be considered neutral.
2025-04-14 23:07:40,873 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The statement presents a factual update on inflation without indicating a change in the monetary policy stance, suggesting a neutral tone."
}
```

The sentence simply reports on the current state of inflation, noting that it has decreased slightly and remains within a target range, without suggesting any immediate action or change in policy direction. This type of language is typically seen as neutral, as it neither leans towards tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) monetary policy.

  "justification": "The Central Reserve Bank of Peru's decision to raise the reference interest rate by 50 bps to 6.50 percent indicates a tightening of monetary policy, which is a hawkish stance."

```

I chose "hawkish" because the sentence explicitly mentions a rate hike, which is a typical characteristic of a hawkish monetary policy stance.

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence simply states a specific interest rate (1.80 percent per year) for certain monetary policy operations without suggesting an increase or decrease in rates, which would be indicative of a hawkish or dovish stance, respectively. The neutral tone of the sentence implies a status quo or a non-changing policy stance.
2025-04-14 23:07:42,614 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance of the given sentence and provide a justification, let's analyze it step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the context of monetary policy stances
- "Hawkish" refers to a monetary policy stance that is focused on controlling inflation, often through higher interest rates.
- "Dovish" refers to a stance that prioritizes economic growth and employment, often through lower interest rates or looser monetary policy.
- "Neutral" indicates a balanced approach, neither strongly hawkish nor dovish.
- "Irrelevant" suggests the information provided does not relate to monetary policy stances.

  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The Central Reserve Bank of Peru's decision to cut the reference rate from 2.50 to 2.25 percent indicates a loosening of monetary policy, suggesting a dovish stance."

```

This classification is based on the fact that a rate cut is a expansionary monetary policy move, which is typically associated with a dovish stance. The sentence also mentions a downside bias to inflation due to lower domestic demand, which further supports a dovish interpretation.

- **Hawkish** refers to a stance that is more inclined towards controlling inflation, often through higher interest rates or reducing money supply, indicating concern about inflation over growth.
- **Dovish** refers to a stance that prioritizes economic growth and employment over inflation, often through lower interest rates or increasing money supply.

The key elements here are the specific percentage (3,50 percent) and the actions mentioned (direct temporary purchases of securities and monetary regulation credits). 

- **Hawkish** refers to a monetary policy stance that is expected to tighten policy, often indicated by higher interest rates or reduced spending/injecting less money into the economy, aiming to curb inflation.
- **Dovish** refers to a stance that is expected to ease policy, often indicated by lower interest rates or

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence simply states a fact about inflation declining in line with forecasts, without indicating a change in monetary policy or a bias towards tightening or easing."
}
```

This sentence does not convey a hawkish (concerned about inflation and potentially raising interest rates) or dovish (concerned about growth and potentially lowering interest rates) tone, but rather a neutral tone, as it merely reports on the current state of inflation without implying any future policy actions.
2025-04-14 23:07:44,424 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a factual decline in economic indicators without expressing a clear stance on future monetary policy actions."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply states a fact about the decline in indicators associated with construction and manufacturing, without suggesting that the Central Reserve Bank of Peru will tighten (hawkish) or loosen (dovish) its monetary policy. The tone is informative and objective, rather than advocating for a specific policy direction.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a reduction in the interest rate, which is a dovish monetary policy stance as it suggests a loosening of monetary policy to stimulate economic growth."
}
```
2025-04-14 23:07:44,424 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual update on inflation and economic performance without indicating a clear direction for future monetary policy, suggesting a neutral stance."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence presents information on inflation and economic performance without expressing a clear concern or optimism that would typically be associated with hawkish or dovish stances, respectively. The mention of "temporary supply shocks" and "slowing growth momentum" could suggest some concern, but overall, the tone is more informative than directive, which aligns with a neutral classification.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a neutral, observational tone, noting global economic volatility without expressing a clear stance on monetary policy or indicating a specific direction for interest rates."

I chose "neutral" because the sentence provides a factual description of the global economy without expressing a clear opinion or bias towards tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) monetary policy. The tone is informative and objective, suggesting that the sentence is not directly related to a specific monetary policy stance.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates that the interest rate is maintained at 2.25 percent, implying no change in the monetary policy stance."

This classification is based on the fact that maintaining the interest rate at the same level suggests that the Central Reserve Bank of Peru is not tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) its monetary policy, but rather keeping it steady, which is a neutral stance.
2025-04-14 23:07:46,348 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance based on the given sentence, let's analyze it step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the sentence
The sentence provided is: "coincident indicators deteriorated, while expectations indicators recovered." This implies that current economic conditions (as indicated by coincident indicators) are worsening, but future expectations (as indicated by expectations indicators) are improving.

## 2: Interpret the implications for monetary policy
- Coincident indicators deteriorating suggest that the economy is currently in a weaker state than before.
- Expectations indicators recovering suggest optimism about the future state of the economy.

## 3: Relate to monetary policy

"Likewise, the board of directors approved the interest rates on the following operations in dollars between the BCRP and the financial system rediscount operations 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point."

The sentence mentions the approval of interest rates for specific operations but does not explicitly indicate a tightening or loosening of monetary policy. However, the fact that it discusses specific interest rates without altering them or providing a clear direction towards lowering or raising them suggests a neutral stance, as there's no clear indication of a shift towards tightening (hawkish) or loosening (

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a factual situation regarding upward pressures on the interbank rate without expressing a clear stance on future monetary policy actions."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply reports on market conditions and their possible cause (income tax payments), without indicating a tightening or loosening of monetary policy or expressing concerns that would typically be associated with a hawkish or dovish stance.

2025-04-14 23:07:48,087 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides factual information about inflation rates without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance, thus maintaining a neutral tone."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence simply reports on the current state of inflation without suggesting any actions or changes in the monetary policy that would indicate a hawkish (tightening) or dovish (loosening) stance. Therefore, it is considered neutral.
2025-04-14 23:07:48,087 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates that the board wants to maintain an expansionary policy stance, suggesting a preference for accommodative monetary policy, which is characteristic of a dovish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the language used in the sentence, which suggests that the Central Reserve Bank of Peru is inclined to maintain a supportive monetary policy stance, given the economic conditions described. The term "expansionary policy stance" and the context of economic activity being below potential level and inflation expectations being anchored, imply a dovish tone.
2025-04-14 23:07:48,087 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance of the given sentence, let's analyze it step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Sentence
The sentence provided is: "in that way, since 2006, the inflation target will be assets continuously". This sentence seems to be incomplete or improperly phrased, but it mentions an inflation target and assets, which are relevant to monetary policy discussions.

## 2: Identify Key Elements
The key elements here are "inflation target" and "since 2006". The mention of an inflation target suggests a focus on controlling inflation, which is a common goal of central banks.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence reports on economic indicators and does not convey any information that would suggest a tightening or loosening of monetary policy, thus it is neutral."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply presents economic data and does not imply any specific action or tone from the Central Reserve Bank of Peru regarding its monetary policy. There is no indication of hawkish (concerned about inflation and potentially raising interest rates) or dovish (focused on growth and potentially lowering interest rates) sentiments. The information provided seems to be more related to
2025-04-14 23:07:48,087 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a concern about rising inflation, which is above the upper limit of the target range, suggesting a potential tightening of monetary policy."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence highlights the inflation rate exceeding the target range, which is likely to prompt a hawkish response from the Central Reserve Bank of Peru, i.e., increasing interest rates to curb inflation.

I chose "neutral" because the sentence appears to be a technical adjustment to the monetary policy framework, rather than a clear shift towards a more hawkish (tightening) or dovish (loosening) stance. The mention of a specific interest rate floor (3.0 percent) and a reference to the weighted average of interbank interest rates suggests a focus on maintaining

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence is merely an announcement of a meeting schedule and does not convey any specific stance on monetary policy."

```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence is simply stating a factual piece of information about a meeting schedule without expressing any views on interest rates, inflation, or other aspects of monetary policy that would suggest a hawkish, dovish, or dovish tone.

The sentence implies that the economy is underperforming, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy, characteristic of a dovish stance.

I chose "neutral" because the sentence presents a mixed assessment of the economy, noting that growth is near its long-term sustainable level, but also mentioning weaknesses in the external market. This balanced tone does not suggest a clear inclination towards tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) monetary policy, nor does it appear irrelevant to monetary policy discussions.

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence highlights inflation concerns, which is typically associated with a hawkish monetary policy stance, implying potential interest rate hikes to combat inflation.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a decrease in inflation rates within the target range, suggesting a stable economic environment that does not require immediate policy action, hence a neutral stance."
}
```

The reasoning behind this classification is that the sentence presents a factual update on inflation rates without indicating any concerns that would necessitate a tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) of monetary policy. The inflation rates are within or at the upper limit of the target range, which suggests that the current policy stance is appropriate, aligning with a neutral classification.
2025-04-14 23:08:00,383 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The central bank's decision to maintain the interest and commission rates used in domestic-currency central bank operations suggests a neutral stance, as it implies no change in the current monetary policy settings."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence indicates that the central bank is maintaining the status quo, without introducing any new measures to tighten or loosen monetary policy. This suggests a neutral stance, as the bank is not signaling a shift towards a more hawkish (tightening) or dovish (loosening) policy.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a balanced outlook with inflation converging to the target range and economic growth near potential output, indicating no strong inclination towards tightening or easing."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence describes a positive outlook for inflation and economic growth, with inflation expectations well-anchored, which suggests that the monetary policy stance is balanced and not leaning towards either tightening (hawkish) or easing (dovish). The tone is informative and descriptive, rather than signaling a specific policy action, which is consistent with a neutral label.
2025-04-14 23:08:02,257 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that the output gap is closing gradually, implying that the economy may not require aggressive monetary policy tightening, which is a dovish stance."
}
```

My reasoning is that a dovish stance is associated with a more accommodative monetary policy, and the sentence implies that the Central Reserve Bank of Peru may not need to take drastic measures to address the output gap, which is consistent with a dovish view.
2025-04-14 23:08:02,257 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a positive trend in inflation, with a low monthly rate and a decline in 12-month inflation for the third consecutive month, which could indicate a less aggressive monetary policy stance."
}
```

The reasoning behind this classification is that a dovish stance is typically associated with a more accommodative monetary policy, which is implied by the positive inflation trends mentioned in the sentence. The tone of the sentence is also neutral to positive, which is consistent with a dovish label. 

Alternatively, one could also argue for a "neutral

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a stable interest rate, indicating no change in the monetary policy stance, which is characteristic of a neutral stance."
}
```

The sentence simply reports that the average interbank interest rate remained stable, with a negligible change from 2.48% in March to 2.49% in April. This suggests that the Central Reserve Bank of Peru is maintaining its current monetary policy stance, which is neither tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish). Therefore, the label "neutral" is assigned.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The central bank kept the reference interest rate unchanged, indicating no change in monetary policy stance, while noting that the inflation target was achieved, which suggests a neutral tone."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the central bank maintained the status quo by keeping the interest rate unchanged, and the tone of the sentence is informative and matter-of-fact, without any indication of a shift towards a more hawkish or dovish stance.

I chose "neutral" because the sentence provides information on climate risks but does not suggest any specific action or change in the monetary policy stance, which would be required to classify it as "hawkish" (implying a tightening of policy) or "dovish" (implying a loosening of policy). The sentence is also not "irrelevant" to the Central Reserve Bank of Peru

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that the Central Reserve Bank of Peru is prepared to withdraw monetary stimulus in anticipation of potential inflationary pressures, indicating a concern for inflation and a tightening bias."
}
```

This classification is based on the idea that a "hawkish" stance is associated with concerns about inflation and a desire to tighten monetary policy to prevent it. The sentence implies that the bank is proactive in addressing potential inflationary pressures, which is consistent with a hawkish stance.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The decline in inflation expectations suggests a less restrictive monetary policy stance, which is consistent with a dovish tone."
}
```

The reasoning behind this classification is that a decline in inflation expectations often leads to a more accommodative monetary policy, which is a dovish stance. This implies that the Central Reserve Bank of Peru might be more likely to cut interest rates or maintain an expansionary monetary policy to support economic growth.

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a concern about rising inflationary expectations, which is a hawkish stance as it suggests a potential tightening of monetary policy to combat inflation."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "hawkish" because it highlights the concern about higher inflationary expectations, which is typically associated with a more cautious or restrictive monetary policy approach, characteristic of a hawkish stance.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides factual information about the Nuevo Sol's appreciation without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance."
}
```

The sentence simply reports on the exchange rate movement of the Nuevo Sol against the dollar, without suggesting any intentions of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru to tighten (hawkish), loosen (dovish), or maintain (neutral) its monetary policy. Therefore, it is classified as neutral.
2025-04-14 23:08:14,808 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence only announces the date of the next monetary policy session without providing any information about the monetary policy stance."
}
```

This sentence does not provide any information about the Central Reserve Bank of Peru's monetary policy stance, so it is classified as "irrelevant".
2025-04-14 23:08:14,808 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual update on inflation rates without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance, hence it is neutral."
}
```

The sentence simply reports on the inflation rate without expressing any concern or intention to adjust the monetary policy, which suggests a neutral tone. There is no indication of a hawkish (concerned about inflation and potentially raising interest rates) or dovish (concerned about growth and potentially lowering interest rates) stance.
2025-04-14 23:08:14,808 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance based on the given sentence, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Understanding the Context**: The sentence discusses the inflation rate without food and energy and its impact on the year-to-year rate.
