A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence describes the current state of short-term and long-term rates, without expressing a prediction or projection about future rates."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "not forward looking" because it reports on the current situation of interest rates, using verbs like "are" and "continue to exhibit", which indicate a description of the present or past, rather than a prediction or projection about the future.
2025-04-14 23:14:25,938 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses past events, specifically the exceptional upward pressures on the interbank rate in March and April, making it not forward looking."
}
```

This sentence is not forward looking because it describes events that have already occurred, rather than making predictions or statements about future events or policy actions.

  "justification": "The sentence discusses past data on inflation rates and price changes, without referencing future expectations or projections."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "not forward looking" because it only reports on past data (inflation rates in November and September) and explains a past phenomenon (the reversal of prices of perishable food products), without expressing any views or projections about future economic conditions or monetary policy actions.

{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses past data and does not express a future prediction or intention regarding the Central Reserve Bank of Peru's monetary policy."
