A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports specific data and trends, indicating a factual and certain statement about past events."
}
```

The sentence reports specific data (inflation rate of -0.04 percent) and describes a clear trend (decline for the sixth consecutive month), which suggests that the information is presented as factual and certain.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains conditional language ('as long as') and uncertain phrases ('should not have'), indicating that the outcome is not guaranteed."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "uncertain" because it expresses a conditional expectation and contains words that imply a degree of uncertainty, such as "should not have". The use of "as long as" also implies that the outcome depends on certain conditions being met, which may or may not happen.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'transitorily' and 'would be', which indicate a degree of uncertainty or prediction rather than a statement of fact."
}
```

This sentence is classified as uncertain because it expresses a prediction or expectation about future events (inflation being above the target range) and uses words that convey a degree of uncertainty.

This sentence is classified as "certain" because it describes a concrete and past action (the approval to raise the reference interest rate) without any ambiguity or indication of doubt.
2025-04-14 23:08:22,387 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific, factual change in the average exchange rate, without any expression of doubt or ambiguity."

  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses uncertainty through phrases such as 'is expected to be around' and 'moderate downside bias due to the possibility of a lower-than expected increase', indicating a degree of unpredictability."
}
```

The sentence is classified as uncertain because it contains phrases that indicate a range of possible outcomes (e.g., "around 2.0 percent") and acknowledges the possibility of variation (e.g., "lower-than expected increase in domestic demand"), which introduce uncertainty into the statement.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains phrases such as 'is expected to remain' and 'due to the possibility of a lower-than expected increase', indicating uncertainty about future events."
}
```

The sentence is classified as uncertain because it expresses expectations and possibilities rather than stating facts or certainties. The use of phrases like "is expected to remain" and "due to the possibility" suggests that the outcome is not guaranteed, introducing uncertainty into the statement.
2025-04-14 23:08:35,909 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'show a modest recovery', which implies a degree of ambiguity and uncertainty about the strength of the economic activity indicators."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because the language used suggests a degree of ambiguity and imprecision, which is typical of uncertain statements. The phrase "modest recovery" implies that the speaker is not entirely sure about the extent of the recovery, and the use of "show" to describe the indicators implies a degree of observation rather than direct knowledge.
2025-04-14 23:08:35,909 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence uses a definitive statement with a specific date, indicating a planned action with no uncertainty."
}
```

The sentence implies a high degree of confidence and specificity about a future event (the approval of the monetary program on June 13), which suggests that it is certain.
