A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

2025-04-14 23:10:49,895 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and structure.

The sentence states: "inflation in May showed a rate of -0.04 percent, as a result of which accumulated inflation in the last 12 months declined for the sixth consecutive month."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence reports historical data and its consequence without expressing any doubt or speculation about future events or uncertain conditions. It is stating facts that have already occurred.

2. **Justification**: The sentence is factual, reporting specific data and a resulting trend without any ambiguity or uncertainty regarding the information presented.

Therefore, the output should be:

2025-04-14 23:10:49,895 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, we need to analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "the latter cost was 8,5 percent."

Let's break it down:

1. The sentence is stating a fact about a specific cost.
2. It provides a precise percentage, "8,5 percent," which indicates a clear and specific piece of information.
3. There is no conditional language, speculation, or ambiguity in the statement.

Given these observations, the sentence is making a definitive statement about a fact.

Therefore, the output should be:

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence is stating a fact about a specific rate being 5.5 percent. It does not express doubt or ambiguity about the rate.

2. **Justification**: The sentence is phrased as a definitive statement, indicating a specific and known value.

Therefore, the output should be:
```json

  "justification": "The sentence states a fact
2025-04-14 23:10:49,895 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "these rises should not have a permanent and generalized impact on the overall prices of the consumer basket as long as expectations continue to be anchored to the inflation target."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence contains the word "should," which indicates a degree of uncertainty or conditionality rather than a statement of fact. It implies a prediction or expectation based on certain conditions being met.

2. **Justification**: The use of "should" and the conditional clause "as long as" introduce uncertainty, making the outcome dependent on future conditions.

Therefore, the classification
2025-04-14 23:10:49,895 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze it step by step.

The sentence is: "in inflation would be transitorily above the upper limit of the target range due to supply shocks in foods and fuels during the first semester."

1. **Understanding the task**: We need to determine if the sentence is certain or uncertain regarding the Central Reserve Bank of Peru's monetary policy meeting.

2. **Analyzing the sentence**: The sentence discusses a projection or expectation about inflation being above a certain target range due to specific factors (supply shocks in foods and fuels). The use of "would be" indicates a conditional or predictive statement rather than a statement

The sentence discusses the forecasted inflation path and its relation to the inflation target range, mentioning conditions under which convergence toward the goal would be achieved. It contains conditional language ("would be maintained," "what would be achieved") and refers to a specific condition ("during the main macroeconomic forecasts of the May inflation report are maintained").

Given this analysis, the sentence implies a level of conditionality and future projection based on certain assumptions, rather than stating a fact or a definitive outcome.

The sentence discusses specific actions and rates set by the Central Reserve Bank of Peru regarding direct security currency repo and rediscount operations, mentioning a fixed interest rate of 7.75 percent per year for a certain number of operations and a different rate set by a committee for additional operations.

Given its detailed and factual nature about a policy decision, the sentence appears to be reporting a decision or policy rather than speculating or expressing doubt about future actions or outcomes.

Therefore, the classification should be based on whether the sentence conveys a sense of certainty or uncertainty about the information it presents.

Here's

The sentence states, "for overnight deposits held by banks at the central bank, the rate is equivalent to the average obtained by the central bank for similar deposits abroad." This sentence describes a factual condition or policy regarding the interest rate for overnight deposits held by banks at the central bank. It does not contain any speculative, conditional, or ambiguous language that would suggest uncertainty about the information being conveyed.

Given the factual nature of the statement, it is reasonable to conclude that the sentence is certain because it describes a specific policy or condition without expressing doubt or uncertainty.

Therefore, the classification is
2025-04-14 23:11:33,685 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, we need to analyze its content and tone to determine if it conveys certainty or uncertainty regarding the Central Reserve Bank of Peru's monetary policy meeting.

2. **Justification**: We must provide a concise explanation for our choice.

Analyzing the sentence:
- The sentence states a fact or a specific observation ("lower prices of public utilities and some food products").
- It does not
2025-04-14 23:11:33,685 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and implications.

The sentence is: "this decision does not necessarily imply a sequence of rises in the reference interest rate, which will depend on the evaluation of inflation determinants current and advanced indicators of production show a highly favorable evolution of the economy in the second quarter."

First, we observe that the sentence contains phrases that indicate a lack of commitment to a specific future action or outcome, such as "does not necessarily imply" and "will depend on." These phrases suggest that the outcome or future actions are conditional and not predetermined.

The phrase "does not necessarily imply a sequence of rises in the reference

The sentence is discussing a future condition ("would continue being favorable"), which inherently involves some level of prediction or expectation rather than a statement of fact. The use of "would" indicates a conditional or future projection, suggesting that the statement is not a certainty but rather a forecast or an expectation based on certain assumptions or conditions.

Therefore, the classification should reflect that the sentence is expressing uncertainty because it deals with a future state that is not guaranteed.

The term "eventual impact" suggests a future possibility rather than a certainty. Additionally, the phrase "very high expansion" is not quantified, leaving room for interpretation.
