A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence reports on past data and trends, without expressing a prediction or projection about future events or policy actions."
}
```

This sentence is not forward looking because it only discusses past inflation data and trends, without mentioning any future expectations, predictions, or policy plans.

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence is forward looking because it discusses the future impact of current events on prices as long as certain conditions, specifically expectations, continue to be met."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "forward looking" because it talks about the future implications of current events (the rises) on prices, conditional on expectations being anchored to the inflation target. This indicates a focus on what is expected to happen in the future, rather than describing a current state or past event.

  "justification": "The sentence describes a specific, current policy setting with detailed conditions, rather than making a prediction or statement about future monetary policy actions."
}
```

This sentence appears to be describing a current policy setting, specifically the interest rates for certain operations, rather than making a statement about future policy actions or economic conditions. Therefore, it is classified as "not forward looking".

{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses future evaluations of inflation determinants and the potential evolution of the economy, indicating a forward-looking perspective."
}
```

I chose "forward looking" because the sentence mentions "will depend on the evaluation of inflation determinants" and "advanced indicators of production show a highly favorable evolution of the economy in the second quarter", which implies a focus on future events and projections.
