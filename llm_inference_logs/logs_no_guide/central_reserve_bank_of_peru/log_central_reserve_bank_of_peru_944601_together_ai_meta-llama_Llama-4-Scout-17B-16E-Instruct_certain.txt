A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it reports specific, verifiable data about past events (inflation rates in November and September) and provides a factual explanation for the observed trend, without expressing any doubt, uncertainty, or subjective opinion.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a specific and intentional action of the BCRP board, indicating a clear and determined policy approach."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it states a clear and deliberate action of the BCRP board, without expressing any doubt or ambiguity. The use of "pays close attention" and "when appropriate" suggests a conditionality, but the overall tone is one of intentionality and predictability, which is typical of certain statements.

  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains phrases that indicate uncertainty, such as 'mixed signals', 'high volatility', and 'similar rates', which suggest a lack of clear outcomes or predictions."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it describes economic indicators and expectations in a way that implies a degree of unpredictability or ambiguity, using words and phrases that convey uncertainty.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a factual observation about the impact of COVID-19 on economic activity and international financial markets, without expressing doubt or ambiguity."

```

However, I can also argue that it is uncertain because it uses words like "risks" and "volatility" which imply a level of uncertainty. Here is an alternative classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses risks and volatility, implying a level of uncertainty and unpredictability in the economic activity and financial markets."

```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it describes a specific decision made by the bank, stating that "the board of directors... decided" to maintain the reference rate, which implies a level of certainty about the event. The use of the past tense also suggests that the decision has been made and is no longer uncertain.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses concerns about potential future effects of international price rises on inflationary expectations, indicating uncertainty about future outcomes."
}
```

Although the sentence states a certain action taken by the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (maintaining the reference interest rate at 4.75%), the mention of concerns about potential future effects of international price rises on inflationary expectations introduces uncertainty, leading to an overall classification of "uncertain".

```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents a concrete piece of information about a specific event (the yield on a 20-year sovereign bond in soles at the close of the month) with a precise value (6.77 percent) and a quantifiable change (increasing 19 bps), without any hedging or uncertain language.

However, I can also argue that:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence is stated as a fact, with no words indicating doubt or uncertainty, suggesting that the speaker assumes the statement to be true."
}
```

But given the context that this sentence relates to economic predictions or analysis, I would stick with:

```

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence states a specific future action that will be taken by the board, indicating a high degree of certainty."
}
```

The sentence mentions a specific date for the session (December 6) and a specific action that will be taken (approving a monetary program), which suggests that the outcome is already determined, hence the classification as "certain".

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence presents a forecast and its underlying factors as a statement of fact, without expressing doubt or ambiguity."

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports specific numerical data, indicating a factual statement with no ambiguity or uncertainty."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence provides precise numbers (0.2 percent and 2.02 percent) without any hedging language or expressions of doubt, suggesting that the information is presented as a fact rather than an uncertain prediction or opinion.
2025-04-14 23:14:04,291 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific and factual outcome of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru's monetary policy meeting and a decrease in the consumer price index, indicating a certain event."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it reports a specific and factual outcome, citing a particular decrease in the consumer price index (0.17 percent) and a specific drop in foodstuffs prices (1.0 percent), which suggests a certain and verifiable event rather than a speculative or uncertain one.
2025-04-14 23:14:04,291 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",

  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains the conditional phrase 'would continue being', indicating a degree of uncertainty or prediction about future events."

{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports historical facts and data about inflation and economic activity, without expressing any doubt or ambiguity."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents factual information about the past (inflation in January, economic activity level) and explains the reasons for the decision, without using uncertain language (e.g., "may", "could", "likely"). The tone is informative and descriptive, indicating a report of actual events rather than speculative or uncertain information.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a specific and detailed monetary policy rule with fixed interest rates and conditions, indicating a certain and predetermined action."

```

Although the sentence discusses several factors that seem to be assessed with a degree of certainty (e.g., economic growth being close to potential, inflation expectations remaining anchored), the presence of phrases that explicitly mention uncertainty (e.g., "international financial conditions are still uncertain") leads to the classification of the overall sentence as uncertain.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific and definitive action taken by the Central Reserve Bank of Peru, indicating a certain outcome."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence states a clear and specific action that has been taken (raising the monetary policy reference rate from 3.25 percent to 3.50 percent), with no indication of doubt, possibility, or future intention. The language used is definitive and assertive, indicating a certain outcome.
