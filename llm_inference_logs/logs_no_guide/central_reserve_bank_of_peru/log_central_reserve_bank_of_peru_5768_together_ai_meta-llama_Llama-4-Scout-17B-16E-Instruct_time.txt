A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses future inflation forecasts and expectations, specifically mentioning the target range during 2017."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "forward looking" because it discusses future inflation forecasts and expectations, specifically mentioning the target range during 2017, which indicates a focus on future events rather than past or current ones.
2025-04-14 23:03:44,212 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses past inflation rates, providing historical data, which indicates it is not forward looking."
}
```

This sentence is not forward looking because it reports on past inflation rates (in August and September) rather than making projections or statements about future economic conditions or policy intentions.
2025-04-14 23:03:44,213 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence reports on past actions taken by the BCRP in March, without expressing future intentions or projections."
}
```

I chose "not forward looking" because the sentence describes a past event (the repo auctions in March) and does not express any future-oriented statements or projections.
2025-04-14 23:03:44,213 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence refers to past actions and their immediate effects, without discussing future plans or projections."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "not forward looking" because it talks about measures that have already been taken and their immediate impact (releasing funds amounting to 2 billion), without mentioning any future actions, plans, or projections.
2025-04-14 23:03:44,213 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses future actions the central bank will take to maintain inflation within a target range, indicating a forward-looking perspective."
}
```

This classification is based on the presence of future-oriented language, such as "will continue to assess" and "to guarantee that the necessary measures are in place", which indicate that the sentence is discussing future events or actions.

  "justification": "The sentence discusses future economic evolution and the potential future decision on the reference interest rate, indicating a forward-looking perspective."
}
```

I chose "forward looking" because the sentence mentions "advanced indicators of production show a highly favorable evolution of the economy in the second quarter" and "which will depend on the evaluation of inflation determinants", indicating that the statement is looking ahead to future developments and potential future decisions.

The sentence discusses specific actions taken by the Central Reserve Bank of Peru regarding monetary policy, including reducing reserve requirements by one percentage point and maintaining the reference interest rate at 6.50 percent. 

Since these actions are described as already approved and specific, rather than discussing future intentions or projections, the sentence can be considered as reporting on past decisions rather than looking forward to future actions or projections.

Therefore, the classification is:

```
