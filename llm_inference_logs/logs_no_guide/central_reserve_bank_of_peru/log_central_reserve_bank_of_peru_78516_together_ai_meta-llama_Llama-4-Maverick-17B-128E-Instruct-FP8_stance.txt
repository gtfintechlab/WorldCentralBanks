A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

2025-04-14 23:09:53,016 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence according to the Central Reserve Bank of Peru's monetary policy stance, let's analyze the information provided.

The sentence mentions that "inflation in May showed a rate of -0.04 percent, as a result of which accumulated inflation in the last 12 months declined for the sixth consecutive month." This indicates a decrease in inflation, specifically a negative rate for the month, suggesting that inflation is not a significant concern at the moment and is actually below the target or expected level.

Given this context, a dovish stance is more likely because a decrease in inflation, especially to a negative rate, often leads to a more accommod

Given sentence: "the latter cost was 8,5 percent"

To analyze this, let's break down the steps:

1. **Understanding the context**: The sentence is related to the Central Reserve Bank of Peru's monetary policy meeting. Discussions around monetary policy often involve inflation, interest rates, and economic growth.

2. **Analyzing the sentence**: The sentence mentions "the latter cost" being "8,5 percent." Without specific context, it could refer to various economic indicators. However, in the context
2025-04-14 23:09:53,016 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, "the latter rate was 5,5 percent," we need to understand the context and implications of the interest rate mentioned.

Given that the sentence refers to an interest rate, likely the policy rate set by the Central Reserve Bank of Peru, we can infer the following:

1. **Interest Rate Mentioned**: The sentence directly mentions a specific interest rate ("5,5 percent"). Interest rates are a key tool used by central banks to implement monetary policy.

2. **Implication of the Rate**: The mere mention of the rate doesn't directly indicate a change or the direction of the monetary policy stance. However,
2025-04-14 23:09:53,016 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence according to the Central Reserve Bank of Peru's monetary policy stance, let's analyze it step by step.

The sentence is: "these rises should not have a permanent and generalized impact on the overall prices of the consumer basket as long as expectations continue to be anchored to the inflation target."

1. **Understanding the sentence**: The sentence implies that the bank is monitoring inflation and is concerned about price rises, but it is optimistic that these rises won't be permanent if inflation expectations remain under control and aligned with the inflation target.

2. **Analyzing the stance**:
   - **Hawkish**: A hawkish stance is
2025-04-14 23:09:53,016 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence related to the Central Reserve Bank of Peru's monetary policy meeting, let's analyze it step by step.

The sentence is: "in inflation would be transitorily above the upper limit of the target range due to supply shocks in foods and fuels during the first semester."

1. **Understanding the sentence**: The sentence indicates that inflation is expected to temporarily exceed the upper limit of the target range. The reason given is supply shocks in foods and fuels during the first semester.

2. **Analyzing the content**:
   - The mention of inflation being "transitorily above the upper limit" suggests a temporary deviation, which
