A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "inflation in May showed a rate of -0.04 percent, as a result of which accumulated inflation in the last 12 months declined for the sixth consecutive month."

1. **Understanding the sentence**: The sentence reports on the inflation rate in May and its impact on the accumulated inflation rate over the last 12 months. It provides historical data.

2. **Determining if it's forward looking**: A statement is considered "forward looking" if it contains information or projections about future events or conditions. The given sentence discusses past data and its immediate consequence on
2025-04-14 23:11:51,304 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, "the latter cost was 8,5 percent," we need to analyze its content and determine if it refers to future events or current/past information.

1. **Understanding the Sentence**: The sentence mentions "the latter cost was 8,5 percent." The verb "was" indicates a past tense, suggesting that the information is about something that has already occurred.

2. **Determining the Label**:
   - **Forward Looking**: A sentence is considered forward looking if it contains information or hints about future events, expectations, or decisions.
   - **Not Forward Looking**: A sentence is not forward looking if
2025-04-14 23:11:51,304 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, "the latter rate was 5,5 percent," we need to analyze its content and determine if it refers to future events or current/past information.

The sentence is stating a fact about a rate being 5.5 percent, using the past tense "was," which indicates it is discussing a past or current state rather than making a statement about the future.

Therefore, the classification should be based on whether the sentence implies future actions, decisions, or states.

Given the information and the tense used, the output should be:

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification":
2025-04-14 23:11:51,304 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and implications.

The sentence is: "these rises should not have a permanent and generalized impact on the overall prices of the consumer basket as long as expectations continue to be anchored to the inflation target."

1. **Understanding the sentence**: The sentence discusses the potential impact of certain "rises" (likely referring to interest rate hikes or price increases) on overall consumer prices, conditioned on inflation expectations remaining anchored to the target set by the Central Reserve Bank of Peru.

2. **Determining if it's forward looking**: A statement is considered "forward looking" if it contains information or projections about future events
2025-04-14 23:11:51,304 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze it step by step.

The sentence is: "in inflation would be transitorily above the upper limit of the target range due to supply shocks in foods and fuels during the first semester."

1. **Understanding the Sentence**: The sentence discusses a future condition related to inflation being above a certain target range due to specific economic factors (supply shocks in foods and fuels) during a specified future period (the first semester).

2. **Identifying Forward-Looking Elements**: The key elements to identify are whether the sentence refers to future events or conditions and if it expresses an expectation, prediction, or intention.
