A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

2025-04-14 23:01:46,609 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that the current benchmark rate is consistent with an inflation forecast within the target range, indicating a neutral stance as it neither tightens nor loosens the policy."
}
```

The sentence implies that the Central Reserve Bank of Peru is comfortable with the current benchmark rate, as it is aligned with an inflation forecast that remains within the target range. The mention of transitory effects on inflation does not seem to trigger a change in the policy stance, which supports a neutral classification.
2025-04-14 23:01:46,609 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a concern about rising inflation, which is a hawkish stance as it suggests a potential need for tighter monetary policy to control inflation."
}
```

This classification is based on the context that a hawkish monetary policy stance is characterized by a focus on controlling inflation, which may involve raising interest rates or reducing money supply. The sentence's mention of rising inflation from 3.53% to 3.74% in a 1-month period implies that the Central Reserve Bank of Peru might take a hawkish stance
2025-04-14 23:01:46,609 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates that the Central Reserve Bank of Peru is taking actions to maintain stability around a specific interest rate, suggesting a neutral stance as it aims to keep the current monetary policy unchanged."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the bank is conducting repo auctions to stabilize the interbank interest rate around the reference interest rate of 4.0 percent, which implies a neutral stance, as it is not introducing new stimulus (dovish) or tightening (hawkish) but rather maintaining stability.
2025-04-14 23:01:46,609 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies an expansionary monetary policy stance by releasing funds amounting to 2 billion, indicating a loosening of monetary policy."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that releasing funds into the economy is a sign of an accommodative or expansionary monetary policy, which is typically associated with a dovish stance.
2025-04-14 23:01:46,609 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a wait-and-see approach, indicating no immediate change in the monetary policy stance, which is characteristic of a neutral tone."
}
```

The sentence does not indicate a clear inclination towards tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) monetary policy, but rather a willingness to assess and adjust as needed to maintain the inflation target, which is a neutral stance.

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a concern about inflation being above the target range, which is a hawkish stance as it suggests potential tightening of monetary policy to combat inflation."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence highlights inflation being above the target range, which is often a concern for central banks and may lead to a tightening of monetary policy, a characteristic of a hawkish stance.
2025-04-14 23:01:48,269 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides factual information about inflation rates without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance, thus it is neutral."
}
```

The sentence simply reports on the current state of inflation without suggesting any future actions or changes in the monetary policy, which is why it is classified as "neutral".
2025-04-14 23:01:48,269 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The Central Reserve Bank of Peru's decision to raise the reference interest rate by 50 bps to 1.0 percent indicates a tightening of monetary policy, which is a hawkish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that a rate hike is typically considered a hawkish move, as it indicates a desire to slow down economic growth and combat inflation.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence simply reports a factual data point about the balance being within a predetermined range, without indicating any change or deviation in monetary policy."
}
```

This sentence appears to be a factual report and does not convey any specific tone or inclination towards tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) monetary policy, hence the classification as "neutral".
2025-04-14 23:01:49,787 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual report on core inflation without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance or expressing a clear concern about inflation, suggesting a neutral tone."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply states a fact about core inflation without expressing any concern or indicating a need for policy action, which would be characteristic of a hawkish or dovish stance, respectively.
2025-04-14 23:01:49,787 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence reports on the decision to maintain the reference rate, indicating a neutral stance as there is no mention of a rate hike or cut."
}
```

The reasoning behind this classification is that the sentence mentions the decision to maintain the reference rate, which implies that the Central Reserve Bank of Peru is not tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) its monetary policy, but rather keeping it steady, hence a neutral stance.
2025-04-14 23:01:49,787 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance of the given sentence and provide a justification, let's analyze it step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Sentence
The sentence provided is: "this cost is lower than that effective since june 6 10,5 percent". The sentence seems to compare a current or proposed cost or interest rate to a previous one, stating that it is lower.

  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a rationale for accommodative monetary policy, suggesting that the current economic activity is below potential and supply shocks have reversed, which typically calls for a dovish or easing stance."

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a modest recovery in economic activity and a rise in public investment, which could imply a need for accommodative monetary policy, aligning with a dovish stance."
}
```

My reasoning is that a dovish stance is associated with a more accommodative monetary policy, which is often indicated by signs of economic weakness or modest growth, suggesting that the central bank may be inclined to keep interest rates low or even cut them to support the economy. In this case, the sentence mentions a modest recovery and a rise in public investment,
2025-04-14 23:01:53,065 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence reports on credit growth statistics without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance or tone, suggesting a neutral classification."
}
```

The sentence appears to simply report on data regarding credit growth to the private sector, without expressing a view on future policy or indicating a shift in the Central Reserve Bank of Peru's stance. Therefore, it is classified as neutral.
2025-04-14 23:01:53,065 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence only announces the date of the next monetary policy session without providing any information about the monetary policy stance."
}
```

This sentence does not provide any information about the Central Reserve Bank of Peru's monetary policy stance, so it is classified as "irrelevant".

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates a reduction in monetary stimulus, which implies an accommodative stance, but the tone suggests a cautious approach, leaning towards easing, characteristic of a dovish stance."
}
```

However, I can improve that. A more accurate classification would be:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions reducing monetary stimulus but frames it as a response to a lack of inflationary pressures and strong production growth indicators, suggesting a balanced approach."
}
```

In this case, I changed my classification

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that supply shocks affecting inflation are reversing, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance."

2025-04-14 23:02:05,756 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The increase in reserve requirements in both domestic and foreign currencies indicates a tightening of monetary policy, which is a hawkish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that raising reserve requirements reduces the amount of funds available for banks to lend, which can help combat inflation and curb economic growth, indicating a hawkish monetary policy stance.
2025-04-14 23:02:05,756 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence is merely an announcement of a scheduled meeting and a procedural step, without any indication of a specific monetary policy stance."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence does not convey any information that would suggest a tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) of monetary policy, and instead appears to be a routine announcement.
2025-04-14 23:02:05,756 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a conditional and technical adjustment to the interest rate mechanism, without indicating a clear tightening or loosening of monetary policy."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence seems to describe a technical rule for setting interest rates under certain conditions, rather than expressing a clear intention to tighten (hawkish) or loosen (dovish) monetary policy. The mention of a specific threshold (4.25 percent) and a mechanical adjustment to interest rates does not convey a strong policy bias.
2025-04-14 23:02:05,756 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence simply reports on the current inflation rate, stating it is within the target range, without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence provides a factual update on the inflation rate without suggesting any tightening or loosening of monetary policy, nor does it indicate a concern that would typically prompt a change in policy stance. Therefore, it is considered neutral.

I classified the sentence as "hawkish" because it suggests that the Central Reserve Bank of Peru is focused on anticipating and addressing potential inflationary pressures, which is a key aspect of a hawkish monetary policy approach. This approach typically involves raising interest rates or taking other measures to reduce inflation and stabilize prices.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual report on inflation rates without expressing a clear stance on future monetary policy actions."

The sentence simply reports on the inflation rate without food and energy, providing a factual update without indicating a tightening or loosening of monetary policy, hence a neutral classification.

This sentence does not indicate a hawkish stance (which would involve concerns about high inflation and potential rate hikes) or a dovish stance (which would involve concerns about low inflation or economic growth and potential rate cuts). Instead, it presents a neutral view, as the expectations are stable and around the target of 2.0 percent. Therefore, the label "neutral" is assigned.

This classification is based on the fact that a rate cut is a dovish move, as it aims to stimulate economic growth by making borrowing cheaper.

2025-04-14 23:02:09,041 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance of the given sentence and provide a justification, let's analyze it step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the context of monetary policy stances
Monetary policy stances are generally classified as hawkish, dovish, neutral, or irrelevant based on their implications for interest rates and economic growth. A hawkish stance suggests a tendency to increase interest rates to combat inflation, a dovish stance suggests a tendency to decrease interest rates to stimulate economic growth, a neutral stance suggests no change or a balanced view, and an irrelevant classification would imply the information does not relate to monetary policy.

2025-04-14 23:02:09,041 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a factual change in the exchange rate without implying any future policy action or tone, indicating a neutral stance."
}
```

The sentence simply reports on the appreciation of the nuevo sol against the dollar, without expressing any views on future monetary policy or implying a tightening or loosening of policy, which is why I classified it as "neutral".
2025-04-14 23:02:09,041 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a potential easing of monetary policy as inflation is lower than expected and economic activity is weaker than anticipated."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence mentions inflation falling below the expected range and lower-than-expected economic activity, which could suggest that the Central Reserve Bank of Peru might adopt a more accommodative monetary policy stance, characteristic of a dovish stance.
2025-04-14 23:02:09,041 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual update on inflation rates without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance, suggesting a neutral tone."
}
```

The sentence simply reports on recent inflation indicators, stating that the inflation rates are within the target range, without expressing any concern or intention to adjust the monetary policy, which is consistent with a neutral stance.
2025-04-14 23:02:09,041 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a accommodative monetary policy stance as it highlights low inflation and subdued economic activity, which could support a case for easing policy."
}
```

The sentence mentions that inflation is declining and is in the lower band of the target range, and that economic activity is lower than the potential growth level. This suggests that the Central Reserve Bank of Peru may be inclined to maintain or adopt an accommodative monetary policy stance, which is characteristic of a dovish stance.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific interest rate decision without indicating a change in the monetary policy stance, suggesting a neutral tone."

```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply reports a specific interest rate decision (5.75 percent) without suggesting a shift in the monetary policy stance, which would be required to classify it as hawkish (more restrictive) or dovish (more accommodative). The sentence's tone is informative and factual, without any indication of a change in policy direction.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific data point within a predetermined range, without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance, hence it is neutral."

```

The sentence simply reports a factual piece of information about the balance being within a specified range and does not convey any indication of a shift towards a more hawkish (tightening) or dovish (loosening) monetary policy stance. Therefore, it is classified as neutral.

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The increase in marginal reserve requirements for obligations in foreign currency suggests a tightening of monetary policy, indicating a hawkish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that raising reserve requirements reduces the amount of funds available for lending, which is a restrictive monetary policy measure. This type of action is typically taken to combat inflation or to stabilize the currency, which are goals associated with a hawkish monetary policy stance.

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence reports on the Lima stock exchange index and does not provide any information about the Central Reserve Bank of Peru's monetary policy stance."
}
```

I chose "irrelevant" because the sentence does not mention the Central Reserve Bank of Peru or its monetary policy, and therefore does not provide any information that could be used to classify its monetary policy stance as hawkish, dovish, or neutral.
2025-04-14 23:02:20,973 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific interest rate for security currency repo and rediscount operations without indicating a change or a significant shift in the monetary policy stance."
}
```

Note that a "neutral" label is chosen because the sentence simply states a specific interest rate without any indication of a change in the monetary policy stance. If the rate were decreased, it would be "dovish", if it were increased, it would be "hawkish". Since there's no information on a change, "neutral" seems the most appropriate classification.
2025-04-14 23:02:20,973 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance based on the given sentence, let's analyze it step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the context
The sentence discusses inflation rates, specifically core inflation and inflation excluding food and energy, over a 12-month period. This context is crucial because inflation rates are a key factor in determining a central bank's monetary policy stance.

## 2: Identify key information
- Core inflation rate: 0.29 percent (current rate) and 3.40 percent (in the last 12 months).
- Inflation excluding food and energy: 0.15 percent (current rate) and 2.
2025-04-14 23:02:20,973 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides factual information about inflation rates without indicating a change in the monetary policy stance, hence a neutral tone."
}
```

The sentence simply reports on recent inflation indicators without expressing a clear direction for future policy actions, which is characteristic of a neutral stance. There is no indication of a hawkish (more aggressive on inflation) or dovish (more accommodative) tone.
2025-04-14 23:02:20,973 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates a commitment to supplying the economy with required liquidity and adopting a more flexible monetary stance, suggesting an accommodative policy approach."
}
```

This classification is based on the language used in the sentence, which implies a willingness to ease monetary policy and provide liquidity to the economy, characteristic of a dovish stance.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that inflation is expected to decline, allowing for a convergence to the target range, implying a potentially accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that a dovish monetary policy stance is characterized by a focus on economic growth and low inflation, which is consistent with the sentence's expectation of declining inflation and convergence to the target range. The tone of the sentence implies that the Central Reserve Bank of Peru may be willing to maintain or adopt a relatively accommodative policy stance to support this outlook.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a positive trend in inflation, which has declined for the fifth consecutive month, indicating a potential easing of monetary policy."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that a decline in inflation, especially for consecutive months, might lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance, which is characteristic of a dovish stance.
2025-04-14 23:02:22,492 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence is neutral as it only mentions the approval of a monetary program without indicating any change in the policy stance or tone."
}
```

This sentence does not convey any specific monetary policy action or tone that would suggest a hawkish (tightening) or dovish (loosening) stance. The mention of approving a monetary program for May is a routine action and does not provide any indication of a change in policy, hence classified as neutral.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific interest rate decision without indicating a change in the monetary policy stance, suggesting a neutral tone."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply reports a decision on interest rates without suggesting a shift in the Central Reserve Bank of Peru's monetary policy stance, which would be required to classify it as hawkish (more aggressive tightening) or dovish (more accommodative easing). The reported rate of 5.75 percent could be seen as a continuation of current policy rather than a change, hence the classification as
2025-04-14 23:02:24,308 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance of the sentence provided, let's analyze it step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the context of monetary policy stances
Monetary policy stances are generally classified as hawkish, dovish, or neutral. A hawkish stance indicates a tendency to increase interest rates to combat inflation. A dovish stance suggests a tendency to decrease interest rates to stimulate economic growth. A neutral stance implies no immediate change in interest rates.

## 2: Analyze the given sentence
The sentence mentions "swap a commission equal to a minimum annual effective cost of 5.25 percent." This sentence seems to
2025-04-14 23:02:24,308 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual statement about expected inflation without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance."
}
```

This sentence simply reports a data point (one-year ahead expected inflation rate) without suggesting any action or change in the monetary policy stance, which is why I classified it as "neutral".
2025-04-14 23:02:24,308 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The increase in interest rates for direct repos and monetary regulation credits from 3.50 percent to 3.75 percent indicates a tightening of monetary policy, which is a hawkish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that an increase in interest rates is a typical indicator of a hawkish monetary policy stance, which aims to curb inflation or slow down an overheating economy.
2025-04-14 23:02:24,308 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence only announces the date of the next monetary policy session without providing any information about the monetary policy stance."
}
```

This sentence does not provide any information about the Central Reserve Bank of Peru's monetary policy stance, so it is classified as "irrelevant".

```

This classification is based on the idea that a hawkish monetary policy stance is one that prioritizes controlling inflation, often by taking proactive measures to prevent inflationary pressures from building. The sentence's mention of anticipating shocks and considering lags of monetary policy influence suggests a vigilant approach to inflation control, which is consistent with a hawkish stance.

I classified the sentence as "neutral" because it appears to be a technical description of the current monetary policy settings, without any indication of a shift towards a more hawkish (tightening) or dovish (loosening) stance. The language used is specific and descriptive, suggesting a neutral or informative tone rather than a directive or guidance-oriented one.
