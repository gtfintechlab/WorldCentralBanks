A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "in this month, the bcrp continued carrying out significative repo auctions in order to stabilize the interbank interest rate around the reference interest rate 4.0 percent in march"

First, we need to understand what "forward looking" means in the context of monetary policy statements. Forward-looking statements are those that provide information or hints about future actions, expectations, or conditions.

Let's break down the sentence:
- It mentions "in this month," which is somewhat ambiguous but suggests a recent past action.
- The action is "continued carrying out significative repo

2025-04-14 23:06:27,696 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and implications regarding the Central Reserve Bank of Peru's monetary policy meeting.

The sentence is: "the central bank will continue to assess all relevant macroeconomic information to guarantee that the necessary measures are in place to maintain inflation within the target range."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence implies future actions and considerations by the central bank, indicating a forward-looking perspective. It mentions that the bank "will continue to assess" information and ensure "necessary measures are in place," which directly points to future intentions or plans.

2. **Justification**: The sentence is classified as "forward looking" because it

The sentence is: "rate bcrp lowered the reference interest rate to 4.0 the board of the central reserve bank of peru approved to lower the monetary policy reference rate to 4.0 percent."

First, we need to understand what "forward looking" means in the context of monetary policy statements. Forward-looking statements are those that provide information or guidance about future actions, expectations, or conditions.

The given sentence discusses an action taken by the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP), specifically lowering the monetary policy reference rate to 4.0 percent.
2025-04-14 23:06:59,379 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, "the latter cost was 6,0 percent," we need to analyze its content and determine if it refers to future events or current/past information.

The sentence is stating a specific value ("6,0 percent") associated with "the latter cost," which implies a reference to something previously mentioned. The use of the past tense ("was") indicates that the sentence is discussing a condition or fact that has already occurred, rather than speculating or stating something about the future.

Therefore, the classification should be based on whether the information is about the future or not.
