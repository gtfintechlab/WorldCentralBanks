A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific decision made by the Monetary Policy Committee, indicating a definitive action."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence states a clear and specific decision made by the Monetary Policy Committee, using phrases such as "decided to reduce", which implies a level of certainty.
2025-04-14 03:33:38,558 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific decision made by Bank Negara Malaysia, using definitive language and providing exact details, indicating a certain event."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence reports a specific and concrete decision made by Bank Negara Malaysia, without any ambiguity or indication of doubt. The use of phrases such as "decided to" and the provision of specific details (e.g. "75 basis points", "2.50 percent") contribute to the certainty of the statement.
2025-04-14 03:33:38,558 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence uses the word 'projected' and provides a specific explanation for the projection, indicating a level of confidence and certainty in the statement."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it uses a projective statement ("is projected to be") and provides a clear explanation for the projection, indicating that the speaker is confident in their assertion. The language used does not convey uncertainty or doubt.
2025-04-14 03:33:38,558 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

However, I can revisit and revise my response upon re-examining the sentence.

{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words and phrases that indicate uncertainty, such as 'somewhat', 'could lead to', and 'further weighing on', which suggest a lack of confidence in the outcome."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it expresses a possibility rather than a certainty, and contains words and phrases that convey a degree of uncertainty or ambiguity.
2025-04-14 03:33:41,389 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence uses the phrase 'on balance' and 'expected to', indicating a degree of uncertainty and prediction rather than a statement of fact."
}
```

The sentence is classified as uncertain because it expresses a prediction or expectation rather than a statement of fact, and the use of phrases like "on balance" suggests that there are various factors to consider, which may affect the outcome.
2025-04-14 03:33:41,389 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my response:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains the word 'albeit at an uneven pace', which implies a degree of uncertainty or variability in the improvement of global economic activity."
}
```

This sentence is classified as uncertain because the phrase "albeit at an uneven pace" suggests that the improvement in global economic activity is not consistent or guaranteed, introducing a level of uncertainty.
2025-04-14 03:33:41,389 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'may' and 'expected', which indicate a degree of uncertainty or prediction rather than a definitive statement."

The sentence is classified as "uncertain" because it expresses a possibility ("may increase") and a expectation ("expected to remain modest"), rather than a statement of fact or a certainty.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence uses assertive language and lacks conditional or speculative phrases, indicating a tone of confidence and certainty about future events."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it uses direct and assertive language, stating that the expansion "would be sustained" by specific factors, without expressing any doubt or uncertainty.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a potential impact on economic performance using phrases like 'will have some impact', indicating a degree of uncertainty."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it uses phrases that suggest a potential or possible effect, rather than stating a definitive outcome. The use of "will have some impact" implies that the effect is likely but not guaranteed, introducing uncertainty into the statement.

```

This sentence is classified as uncertain because it expresses a prediction or expectation about future economic trends, rather than stating a known fact. The use of words like "expected" and "moderate" implies a degree of uncertainty or ambiguity, which is characteristic of uncertain statements.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains the word 'will be', indicating a prediction about the future, which inherently involves uncertainty."

```

Alternatively, I can also justify it as:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The use of the word 'low' without a specific range or target value implies a degree of uncertainty about the future inflation rate."
}
```

Both justifications lead to the same conclusion that the sentence is uncertain.

  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains conditional phrases and hedging words, such as 'once global conditions stabilise' and 'the prospects remain intact', indicating uncertainty about the future economic recovery."
}
```

This sentence is classified as uncertain because it expresses a conditional or potential future outcome, rather than a definitive or guaranteed one. The use of phrases like "once global conditions stabilise" and "the prospects remain intact" suggests that the economic recovery is not a certainty, but rather a possibility that depends on various factors.

  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'expected' and 'moderating' that indicate a degree of uncertainty or prediction rather than a statement of fact."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it expresses a prediction or expectation about future events (global growth, labour market conditions, inflation, and monetary policy) rather than stating a current fact. The use of words like "expected" and "moderating" implies a degree of uncertainty or unpredictability, which is characteristic of uncertain statements.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'likely' and 'within the earlier projected ranges', indicating a degree of uncertainty and conditionality in the statement."
}
```

The sentence is classified as uncertain because it uses words and phrases that convey a degree of doubt or conditionality, such as "likely" and "within the earlier projected ranges". This suggests that the outcome is not guaranteed, but rather subject to certain conditions or expectations.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains the word 'expected', which indicates a degree of uncertainty about future events."

```
{
  "label": "certain",
