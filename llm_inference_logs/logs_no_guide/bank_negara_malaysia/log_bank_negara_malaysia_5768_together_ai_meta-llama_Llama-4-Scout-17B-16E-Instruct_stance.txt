A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

2025-04-14 03:27:39,763 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates a cautious and monitoring stance, acknowledging risks but not explicitly signaling a change in policy, which is characteristic of a neutral monetary policy stance."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence does not contain language that suggests a tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) of monetary policy, but rather a careful observation of risks and their implications, which is consistent with a neutral stance.
2025-04-14 03:27:39,763 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence has a positive tone but does not explicitly suggest a change in monetary policy, indicating a neutral stance."
}
```

The sentence mentions favourable economic prospects and domestic structural reforms that will provide support to the ringgit, but it does not imply any specific action or change in the monetary policy, hence it is classified as neutral.
2025-04-14 03:27:39,763 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates a decision to adjust the OPR to prevent financial imbalances, suggesting a tightening of monetary policy to normalize conditions."
}
```

This classification is based on the language used in the sentence, which implies a desire to normalize monetary conditions and prevent financial imbalances, indicating a hawkish stance focused on controlling potential inflationary pressures or financial stability risks.
2025-04-14 03:27:39,763 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates a cautious and monitoring approach without signaling a change in policy, suggesting a neutral stance."
}
```

The sentence implies that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is taking a wait-and-see approach, monitoring the situation without giving any indication of tightening or loosening policy, which is characteristic of a neutral monetary policy stance.
2025-04-14 03:27:39,763 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my response:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that monetary policy decisions will be data-dependent and flexible, indicating a neutral stance as it neither signals a clear tightening nor easing bias."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "neutral" because it implies that the monetary policy committee (MPC) will maintain a flexible and data-driven approach, without giving any clear indication of a shift towards a more hawkish (tightening) or dovish (easing) stance.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a neutral observation about the economic improvement in major advanced economies without indicating any specific policy action or bias."

I classified the sentence as "neutral" because it simply states a fact about the economic situation in major advanced economies without expressing any hawkish (concern about inflation and potential rate hikes) or dovish (concern about economic growth and potential rate cuts) sentiment.
2025-04-14 03:27:41,687 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a decrease in inflation rate due to a decline in domestic fuel prices, which could imply a less aggressive monetary policy stance."
}
```

The reasoning behind this classification is that a decrease in inflation rate, especially due to a decline in domestic fuel prices, might lead to a dovish monetary policy stance, as the central bank may see less need to tighten policy to control inflation.
2025-04-14 03:27:41,687 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that inflation is driven by supply factors rather than demand, implying a less aggressive monetary policy stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence downplays the role of excess demand in driving inflation, which is a key concern for central banks when considering tightening monetary policy (a hawkish stance). By emphasizing supply factors, the sentence implies that the Bank Negara Malaysia may be less likely to raise interest rates or take other hawkish actions, which is consistent with a dovish stance.
2025-04-14 03:27:41,687 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence focuses on the positive outlook of investment activity and its contributing factors, without mentioning any changes to monetary policy or expressing concerns about inflation or economic growth that would suggest a hawkish or dovish stance."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "neutral" because it provides an optimistic view of investment activity and its drivers, but does not imply any specific direction for monetary policy or express concerns that would typically be associated with a hawkish (concerned about inflation) or dovish (concerned about economic growth) stance.
2025-04-14 03:27:41,687 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my response:

  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual update on the financial sector's stability and growth of financing to the private sector, without indicating any inclination towards tightening or loosening monetary policy."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "neutral" because it simply presents a neutral or positive assessment of the current state of financial institutions and the growth of financing to the private sector, without suggesting any change in the monetary policy stance. There is no indication of a hawkish (tightening) or dovish (loosening) tone, hence the label "neutral".

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a positive outlook on investment activity without indicating any changes to monetary policy, suggesting a neutral stance."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "neutral" because it provides a positive but general outlook on investment activity without suggesting any specific actions or changes to monetary policy that would indicate a hawkish (more aggressive) or dovish (more accommodative) stance.
2025-04-14 03:27:43,015 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions upside risks to inflation, indicating a concern about potential inflationary pressures, which is a characteristic of a hawkish monetary policy stance."
}
```

This sentence suggests that the speaker is vigilant about inflation risks, which is consistent with a hawkish stance, which tends to prioritize controlling inflation over stimulating economic growth.
2025-04-14 03:27:43,015 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that the decline in prices is due to external factors, implying a relaxed monetary policy stance."
}
```

The sentence implies that the decline in prices is largely driven by external factors (fuel prices and food prices), which suggests that the monetary policy stance is dovish, as it may not require tightening to control inflation.
2025-04-14 03:27:43,015 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence is merely an announcement of the meeting schedule and does not convey any specific monetary policy stance."
}
```

The sentence is simply stating the logistical details of the meeting and does not provide any indication of the monetary policy stance, hence it is classified as "neutral".
2025-04-14 03:27:43,015 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my response:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions headwinds to global growth outlook, implying a concern for economic slowdown, which is a dovish stance."

I classified the sentence as "dovish" because it expresses concern about the global growth outlook, which is typically associated with a dovish monetary policy stance that prioritizes economic growth over inflation concerns.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",

The sentence implies that the current economic conditions are under control, with no strong demand pressures, and economic activity is expanding, but it does not suggest any inclination towards raising or lowering interest rates. This balanced view, focusing on stability and the current state of the economy without indicating a need for policy change, aligns with a neutral monetary policy stance.

This classification is based on the understanding that:

I classified the sentence as "neutral" because it does not convey a clear hawkish (concerned about inflation and potentially raising interest rates) or dovish (concerned about economic growth and potentially lowering interest rates) tone. The sentence appears to be a factual observation, which is consistent with a neutral stance.

The sentence does not explicitly mention the Bank Negara Malaysia's monetary policy, but the described global economic conditions could lead to a dovish monetary policy stance to mitigate potential risks. 

Alternatively, one could argue that it is "neutral" if the sentence is seen as simply describing global conditions without any clear implication for monetary policy. However, given that increased volatility and uncertainties

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual update on global inflation trends without expressing a clear stance on monetary policy, hence it is neutral."
}
```

The sentence simply reports on the current state of global inflation without indicating a need to tighten (hawkish) or loosen (dovish) monetary policy, making it neutral.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual description of market trends without indicating a specific direction for monetary policy, suggesting a neutral stance."
}
```

The sentence simply reports on the current state of domestic financial markets and their alignment with regional economies, without expressing a clear inclination towards tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) monetary policy. Therefore, it is classified as neutral.

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that the degree of monetary accommodation may be reviewed due to sustained growth and inflation risks, implying a potential tightening of policy."
}
```

This classification is based on the indication that the monetary policy stance may become less accommodative, which is a hawkish signal. The mention of "risks to inflation" and "sustained growth" suggests that the central bank may consider reducing the degree of monetary accommodation, which is consistent with a hawkish stance.

{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates a concern about potential financial imbalances from low interest rates, suggesting a cautious or tightening bias in monetary policy."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "hawkish" because it implies that the MPC is mindful of the risks associated with prolonged low interest rates and is likely to consider tightening monetary policy to prevent financial imbalances, which is a hawkish stance.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a balanced outlook on inflation and economic growth, without indicating a need for immediate policy tightening or loosening."
}
```

The sentence does not suggest a strong inclination towards raising interest rates (hawkish) or lowering them (dovish). Instead, it presents a balanced view of the economy, expecting gradual price increases in line with improved domestic economic conditions and possible adjustments in administered prices. This balanced tone aligns with a neutral monetary policy stance.

{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests potential risks to economic recovery, implying a need for continued accommodative monetary policy, which is a dovish stance."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "dovish" because it highlights potential downside risks to the economic recovery due to COVID-19 resurgences, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance. This implies that the central bank may maintain or ease its policy to support the economy, which is a characteristic of a dovish stance.

{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that inflation will remain contained despite robust domestic demand, indicating a balanced view that neither strongly suggests tightening nor easing monetary policy."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "neutral" because it implies that the current monetary policy stance is likely to be maintained, with the expectation that inflation will be kept under control. The tone is neither overly optimistic nor pessimistic, suggesting a neutral stance.

{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions potential effects on inflation and demand conditions, but does not explicitly indicate a tightening or loosening of monetary policy, hence a neutral stance."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence provides information about potential future factors that may influence the economy, but does not express a clear direction or bias towards a more restrictive (hawkish) or more accommodative (dovish) monetary policy stance.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a reduced concern about inflation and an increased concern about growth, indicating a more accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the following reasoning:

* The sentence mentions that "concerns about inflation have subsided", which implies a reduced need for tightening monetary policy.
* The sentence also mentions "downside risks to global growth have increased significantly" and "slower growth sets in", which implies a greater concern about economic growth.
* The overall tone of the sentence suggests that the central bank may be

  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual assessment of export growth without indicating a change in monetary policy or a clear bias towards tightening or easing, hence it is neutral."

I classified the sentence as "neutral" because it simply presents an economic outlook without suggesting any specific action or inclination towards a more hawkish (tightening) or dovish (easing) monetary policy stance.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a positive outlook for economic growth with continued policy support, indicating a accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "dovish" because it implies that the central bank will maintain a supportive monetary policy stance, which is consistent with a dovish tone. The mention of "continued policy support" suggests that the bank is likely to keep interest rates low or maintain other accommodative measures to support economic growth.

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates an increase in the overnight policy rate, which suggests a tightening of monetary policy, characteristic of a hawkish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that an increase in interest rates (in this case, the overnight policy rate) is typically associated with a hawkish monetary policy stance, aimed at curbing inflation or slowing down economic growth.

My reasoning is that a deterioration in the economic environment is often associated with a need for accommodative monetary policy, which is a dovish stance. This type of language can signal that the central bank may be inclined to cut interest rates or implement other expansionary policies to mitigate the negative effects of the economic downturn.

I classified the sentence as "dovish" because it implies that the central bank is willing to provide more stimulus to support growth, which is a dovish stance. The mention of "additional policy support" suggests that the bank is inclined to take action to boost the economy, which is consistent with a dovish monetary policy stance.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that weaker economic conditions will reduce inflationary pressures, implying a more accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "dovish" because it implies that the economic conditions are weak enough to mitigate inflationary pressures, which is a concern that is typically associated with an accommodative monetary policy stance. This suggests that the central bank may be more likely to ease monetary policy or keep it loose, which is a dovish stance.

{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a neutral assessment of the global economy, describing a moderate pace of expansion and a synchronized slowdown, without suggesting any specific policy action or bias."

This sentence does not suggest that the central bank is leaning towards a more aggressive monetary policy stance (hawkish) or a more accommodative one (dovish). Instead, it highlights a neutral aspect of monetary policy implementation, which is maintaining stability in the foreign exchange market. Therefore, I classify the sentence as "neutral".

The sentence simply reports on the current state of inflation (averaging 2.8 year-to-date) without suggesting that the central bank will tighten (hawkish) or loosen (dovish) its monetary policy, nor does it provide any indication that the information is unrelated to monetary policy (irrelevant).

{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual statement about the economy without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance, hence it is neutral."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply states a fact about the economy, mentioning that private consumption will be supported by growth in income and employment, and government measures, without expressing any concern about inflation, growth, or suggesting a change in interest rates. This type of statement is typically considered neutral in terms of monetary policy stance.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence focuses on the overall stability and resilience of the Malaysian economy, without indicating any inclination towards tightening or loosening monetary policy."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence highlights the positive aspects of the Malaysian economy, such as diversified sources of growth, low unemployment, and a well-capitalised banking system, without expressing any concern or urgency that would suggest a hawkish or dovish stance. The tone is informative and descriptive, rather than advocating for a specific policy action.

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a tightening of monetary policy to reduce inflationary pressures, which is a hawkish stance."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "hawkish" because it suggests that central banks will adjust their monetary policy settings at a faster pace to reduce inflationary pressures, which is a characteristic of a hawkish monetary policy stance.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a balanced approach to monetary policy, aiming for both steady growth and price stability, indicating a neutral stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the sentence's indication of a balanced approach, which is consistent with a neutral monetary policy stance. The mention of supporting a steady growth path and maintaining price stability does not suggest a bias towards tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) monetary policy.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions a fact about international financial markets without expressing a clear stance on monetary policy, indicating a neutral tone."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply states a fact about volatility in international financial markets without expressing a clear opinion or direction on monetary policy, which would be characteristic of a hawkish (favoring tighter monetary policy) or dovish (favoring looser monetary policy) stance.
