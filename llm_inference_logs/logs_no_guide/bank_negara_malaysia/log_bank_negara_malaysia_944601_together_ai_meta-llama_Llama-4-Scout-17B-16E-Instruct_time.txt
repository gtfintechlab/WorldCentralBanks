A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence contains projections and predictions about future events, specifically the peak and moderation of headline inflation, indicating a forward-looking statement."
}
```

This classification is based on the presence of future-oriented language, such as "projected to peak", "before moderating thereafter", and "in line with the expected easing", which indicate that the sentence is discussing anticipated future events rather than past or current facts.
2025-04-14 07:30:12,433 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses future actions and implications on the overall outlook for inflation and domestic growth, indicating a forward-looking perspective."
}
```

This classification is based on the presence of future-oriented phrases such as "will continue to assess" and "implications on the overall outlook", which suggest that the sentence is discussing future events or prospects rather than past or current ones.
2025-04-14 07:30:12,433 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my response:

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses current or past economic indicators, rather than making predictions or statements about future economic conditions or policy actions."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "not forward looking" because it refers to "the latest indicators" and describes the current state of economic activity, without expressing a projection or outlook for future economic developments.

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses future expectations about domestic demand, growth drivers, and investment trends, indicating a forward-looking statement."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "forward looking" because it uses verbs and phrases that imply future predictions or expectations, such as "will remain", "underpinned by", and "sustained", which indicate a projection or outlook rather than a statement about current or past facts.
