A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that inflation will decrease due to lower cost pressures and slowdown in demand, implying a more accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "dovish" because it implies that the monetary policy will likely be more relaxed or accommodative, as the expected decrease in inflation may reduce the need for tight monetary policy.
2025-04-14 03:38:06,615 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a strong economy, which could lead to concerns about inflation and thus a hawkish stance on monetary policy."
}
```

In this case, I classified the sentence as "hawkish" because a robust expansion in the economy may lead to inflationary pressures, which a hawkish monetary policy stance would aim to mitigate by potentially increasing interest rates or tightening policy.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual observation about the expected improvement in exports without indicating any change in monetary policy or a bias towards tightening or easing."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "neutral" because it simply states a positive factor that may support growth, without expressing a clear inclination towards a more hawkish (tightening) or dovish (easing) monetary policy stance.
2025-04-14 03:38:06,615 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates a reduction in monetary accommodation, suggesting a shift towards a less accommodative monetary policy stance, which is characteristic of a hawkish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the understanding that:

* Dovish: expansionary or accommodative monetary policy stance
* Hawkish: contractionary or less accommodative monetary policy stance
* Neutral: no change in monetary policy stance
* Irrelevant: sentence does not relate to monetary policy stance

In this case, the sentence mentions reducing the degree of monetary accommodation, which

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence focuses on the containment of subsidy adjustments' impact on consumption spending through targeted financial assistance, without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "neutral" because it does not suggest any tightening or loosening of monetary policy, but rather highlights a mitigating factor for the economy. The sentence's tone is informative and objective, without expressing a clear hawkish or dovish view.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual observation about inflation without indicating a change in monetary policy or a clear bias towards tightening or easing."

I classified the sentence as "neutral" because it simply states a fact about inflation without expressing a clear stance or inclination towards a more hawkish (tightening) or dovish (easing) monetary policy.
2025-04-14 03:38:08,662 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my response:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a concern for economic growth, suggesting that the central bank may maintain or adopt an accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

The sentence indicates that there are downside risks to growth, which suggests that the central bank may prioritize growth over inflation concerns, a dovish stance.
2025-04-14 03:38:08,662 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual projection of inflation without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance, hence a neutral tone."
}
```

The sentence simply provides an inflation forecast without suggesting any specific action or change in the monetary policy stance, which is characteristic of a neutral tone. There is no indication of a hawkish (tightening) or dovish (loosening) stance.
2025-04-14 03:38:08,662 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates a cautious and data-dependent approach, suggesting no immediate change in monetary policy, which is characteristic of a neutral stance."
}
```

This sentence does not suggest a tightening or easing of monetary policy, nor does it express a strong concern about inflation or growth, which would be indicative of a hawkish or dovish stance, respectively. Instead, it implies a wait-and-see approach, which is consistent with a neutral monetary policy stance.
2025-04-14 03:38:08,662 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a strong economy, which could lead to inflationary pressures and a need for tighter monetary policy, indicating a hawkish stance."
}
```

My reasoning is that a hawkish monetary policy stance is associated with concerns about inflation and a strong economy, which may require interest rate hikes or other measures to slow down growth and control inflation. The sentence's description of "sustained strength in economic activity" and "higher export activity" implies a robust economy, which is consistent with a hawkish view.

I classified the sentence as "neutral" because it presents a balanced view of growth prospects in Asia without suggesting any inclination towards tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) monetary policy. The sentence focuses on the economic outlook rather than policy actions, which is consistent with a neutral stance.
2025-04-14 03:38:10,290 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my response:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence focuses on the drivers of growth without mentioning inflation or any need for policy adjustments, indicating a neutral stance."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "neutral" because it provides an objective assessment of the factors driving growth without expressing any concerns about inflation or suggesting a need for monetary policy tightening (hawkish) or easing (dovish). The tone is informative and descriptive, rather than advocating for a specific policy action.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides an objective projection about investment activity without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance, hence it is neutral."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply states a projection about investment activity without suggesting any tightening or loosening of monetary policy, which is a key aspect of hawkish or dovish stances.
2025-04-14 03:38:10,290 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my response:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",

{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a stable currency, which implies no immediate need for a change in monetary policy, hence a neutral stance."

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The decision to maintain the overnight policy rate at 1.75 percent indicates a neutral stance, as there is no change to the monetary policy setting."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence reports a decision to keep the interest rate unchanged, which typically corresponds to a neutral monetary policy stance. A hawkish stance would involve an increase in interest rates, while a dovish stance would involve a decrease. Since the rate is maintained at the current level, the stance is neutral.

I classified the sentence as "dovish" because it emphasizes the potential risks and uncertainties facing the economy, which is a tone often used by central banks to signal a willingness to ease monetary policy or keep it accommodative. This suggests that the Bank Negara Malaysia may be inclined to maintain or adopt a loose monetary policy stance to mitigate these risks.

  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a cautious tone, implying that the central bank may adopt a more accommodative monetary policy stance due to increased global economic uncertainties."
}
```

The sentence mentions "increased concerns" and "policy uncertainties" which typically lead to a more cautious or dovish tone, suggesting that the central bank may prioritize economic stability over inflation concerns. This leads to a dovish classification.

I classified the sentence as "dovish" because it implies that the lower global commodity and energy prices will help mitigate any potential negative effects, which is a dovish signal. This suggests that the monetary policy stance is more inclined towards easing or maintaining a loose policy.

{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual forecast of inflation without indicating a tightening or loosening of monetary policy, hence it is neutral."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply states an expectation about future inflation without expressing a concern that would typically lead to a hawkish (concerned about inflation and potentially raising interest rates) or dovish (concerned about growth and potentially lowering interest rates) stance.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence does not express a clear stance on monetary policy, instead discussing a precondition for economic stability in advanced economies."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "neutral" because it does not convey a clear direction or bias towards tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) monetary policy, nor does it directly relate to the Bank Negara Malaysia's monetary policy meeting. The sentence appears to be informative and focuses on a broader economic condition, which is why I did not assign a label that implies a specific policy stance.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions deterioration in global economic and financial conditions, suggesting a need for accommodative monetary policy, which is a dovish stance."
}
```

My reasoning is that the sentence highlights negative factors affecting the global economy, which would likely lead to a dovish monetary policy stance, i.e., one that is more accommodative and potentially easing. This is because a dovish stance is often associated with concerns about economic growth and financial stability, and the sentence's focus on deteriorating conditions suggests that the speaker is more concerned about downside risks

{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a concern about high inflation, which is a hawkish stance, as it suggests that the central bank may need to take action to mitigate inflationary pressures."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "hawkish" because it highlights the expectation of high inflation, which is a concern typically associated with a hawkish monetary policy stance. This stance is often characterized by a focus on controlling inflation, which may involve increasing interest rates or taking other measures to reduce demand and curb price increases.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that inflation is driven by supply factors rather than demand, implying a less aggressive monetary policy stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence downplays the role of excess demand in driving inflation, which is a key concern for central banks when considering tightening monetary policy (a hawkish stance). By emphasizing supply factors, the statement implies a more accommodative or dovish stance, suggesting that the central bank may be less likely to raise interest rates or take other measures to tighten policy.

The sentence implies that the MPC is concerned about potential negative impacts on the economy and is prepared to take action, which is consistent with a dovish monetary policy stance.

This sentence implies that the central bank may maintain or ease its monetary policy, which is a dovish stance. The mention of "weaker domestic growth prospects" and "labour market conditions" suggests that the economy may need support, which is consistent with a dovish monetary policy stance.

The reasoning behind this classification is that a dovish stance is typically associated with a more accommodative monetary policy, which is often implied when inflation is expected to be lower. This could suggest that the central bank may be more likely to cut interest rates or maintain an easy monetary policy to support the economy. 

In contrast, a hawkish stance is associated with a tighter monetary policy, which

```

I classified the sentence as "neutral" because it simply provides an outlook on exports without suggesting any specific action or bias regarding monetary policy, which would be required to classify it as hawkish (implying tighter monetary policy) or dovish (implying looser monetary policy). The sentence's tone is informative and does not convey a clear direction that would influence expectations about future monetary policy decisions

  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence focuses on a positive economic growth performance without mentioning any changes to monetary policy, indicating a neutral stance."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "neutral" because it simply reports on the strong growth performance in Malaysia without suggesting any tightening or loosening of monetary policy, which is a key aspect of hawkish or dovish stances. The sentence provides a factual update on the economy without expressing a clear policy bias, hence neutral.

I classified the sentence as "neutral" because it presents a balanced view of the inflation outlook, acknowledging both the upward pressure from domestic demand and the expectation that inflation will remain contained. This tone is neither alarmist nor complacent, suggesting that the monetary policy stance is likely to remain steady, rather than shifting towards a more hawkish or dovish direction.

{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides an optimistic outlook on economic growth drivers, but does not suggest any changes to the monetary policy stance, hence a neutral classification."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence focuses on the positive factors supporting economic growth, such as stable employment, wage growth, and ongoing investment projects, without indicating any inclination towards tightening or loosening monetary policy. This suggests a neutral stance, where the current policy is seen as appropriate to support the economy.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates that the bank has decided to maintain the current stance of monetary policy, suggesting no change in policy, which is a neutral stance."

```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence mentions maintaining the current stance of monetary policy, which implies no tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) of policy. The consideration of both downside risks to growth and upside risks to inflation suggests a balanced approach, which is consistent with a neutral stance.

* The sentence highlights the risk of higher inflation due to supply disruptions and global price increases, which suggests that the speaker is vigilant about inflation, consistent with a hawkish stance.
