A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'expected' and 'going forward', which indicate a degree of uncertainty and prediction rather than a statement of fact."
}
```

This sentence is classified as uncertain because it expresses a prediction or expectation about future events (the impact of cost pressures and demand slowdown on inflation) rather than stating a known fact.
2025-04-14 07:29:23,921 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my response:

```
{
  "label": "certain",

```
2025-04-14 07:29:23,921 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my response:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains the word 'expected', which indicates a degree of uncertainty about the future improvement in exports."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because the use of the word "expected" implies a prediction or forecast, rather than a statement of fact. This suggests that the outcome is not guaranteed, and therefore, the sentence expresses some level of uncertainty.
2025-04-14 07:29:23,921 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my response:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a specific decision made by the MPC, indicating a definitive action."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it states a clear and specific decision made by the MPC, without any ambiguity or indication of doubt. The use of the phrase "the MPC decided" suggests a firm and conclusive action, which supports the classification as certain.
2025-04-14 07:29:23,921 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my response:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains the word 'expected', which indicates a degree of uncertainty or prediction rather than a statement of fact."
}
```

This sentence is classified as uncertain because it expresses a prediction or expectation about the impact of subsidy adjustments, rather than stating a known or certain fact. The use of the word "expected" implies that there is some degree of uncertainty or unpredictability involved.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words and phrases with uncertain connotations, such as 'projected', 'expected', and 'before moderating thereafter', which indicate a degree of uncertainty."

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it expresses a projection or forecast about future events (headline inflation peaking and moderating) using words and phrases that imply a degree of uncertainty, rather than stating a fact with complete confidence.
2025-04-14 07:29:25,586 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'will continue to assess' and 'evolving conditions', indicating that the outcome or future actions are not fixed or guaranteed, hence uncertain."

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words with uncertain tone such as 'will be supported', indicating a prediction rather than a statement of fact."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it expresses a prediction about future growth, using phrases like "will be supported", which implies a degree of uncertainty.
2025-04-14 07:29:27,103 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",

}
```
2025-04-14 07:29:27,103 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence uses the word 'projected' and 'led by', indicating a confident prediction or statement about future events."
}
```

However, I can also argue that it is uncertain because it talks about a projection. Here is an alternative:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence uses the word 'projected', indicating a forecast or prediction about future events, which may not be certain."
}
```

In this case, I think the first classification as "certain" might be more suitable,
2025-04-14 07:29:27,103 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'expected' and 'mainly reflecting', which indicate a degree of uncertainty or prediction rather than a statement of fact."
}
```

This classification is based on the presence of words that suggest a forecast or prediction, rather than a definitive statement, which indicates uncertainty.
2025-04-14 07:29:27,103 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific and factual decision made by the meeting, indicating a certain outcome."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "certain" because it states a fact about a specific decision made by the meeting, without any ambiguity or uncertainty.

{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains a vague phrase 'will also provide additional impetus' which implies a prediction or expectation rather than a definitive statement."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it expresses a prediction or expectation about the future impact of measures under budget 2024, rather than stating a fact or a certainty. The use of the phrase "will also provide additional impetus" implies a degree of uncertainty or unpredictability about the outcome.

  "justification": "The sentence reports a factual observation about the global economy using a definitive tone, indicating a certain state of affairs."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents a statement about the global economy using a strong and definitive tone, without any hedging or uncertainty. The use of phrases like "has strengthened further" and "more entrenched and synchronised" suggests a high degree of confidence in the assessment, which is typical of statements about established facts rather than uncertain predictions.

  "justification": "The sentence contains words and phrases with uncertain connotations, such as 'expected', 'will be cushioned', and 'moderating', which indicate a degree of unpredictability and ambiguity."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because, despite the generally positive tone, the language used suggests that the outcome is not guaranteed and is subject to various factors. The use of words like "expected" and "will be cushioned" implies a level of uncertainty and unpredictability, which is characteristic of uncertain statements.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'will affect' and 'will be less severe', which indicate a degree of uncertainty about the future impact of the containment measures."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it expresses a prediction about the future impact of the containment measures, which is inherently uncertain. The use of words like "will affect" and "will be less severe" indicates a degree of uncertainty about the outcome.

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it mentions "downside risks" and the need to "closely monitor and assess" their implications, which implies a level of uncertainty and unpredictability.
