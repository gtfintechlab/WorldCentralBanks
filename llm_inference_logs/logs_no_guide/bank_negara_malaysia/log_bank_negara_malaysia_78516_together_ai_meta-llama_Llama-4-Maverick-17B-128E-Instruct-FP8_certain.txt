A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "in the mpcs assessment, there continue to be uncertainties in the balance of risks surrounding the outlook for domestic growth and inflation."

First, I notice that the sentence explicitly mentions "uncertainties," which directly indicates a lack of certainty.

Therefore, my classification is as follows:

{
"label": "uncertain",
"justification": "The sentence explicitly mentions 'uncertainties' in the balance of risks surrounding domestic growth and inflation outlook."

The sentence is: "going forward, the economy is expected to expand further in 2010, with growth being supported by strengthening domestic demand, particularly private consumption, and further improvements in external demand."

1. The sentence uses the phrase "is expected to," which indicates a prediction or forecast rather than a statement of fact. This kind of language often introduces some level of uncertainty because it refers to future events or outcomes that have not yet occurred.

2. Despite the use of "is expected to," the overall tone of the sentence is positive and suggests a degree of confidence in

The sentence is: "headline inflation is expected to remain moderate for the remainder of 2012".

1. **Label Assignment**: The key phrase here is "is expected to remain," which indicates a prediction or forecast rather than a statement of fact.

2. **Justification**: The use of "expected" suggests a degree of uncertainty because it reflects a forecast or anticipation rather than a certainty.

The sentence is: "leading indicators, however, point to a softening of the near-term global economic outlook, with considerable downside risks remaining primarily from prolonged trade tensions."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence contains phrases like "point to a softening" which indicates a direction or trend based on current data, and "considerable downside risks remaining" which introduces an element of uncertainty due to the risks involved, particularly from "prolonged trade tensions." The presence of "however" also suggests a contrast or a caveat, adding to the uncertainty.

The sentence is: "headline inflation is likely to average negative in 2020 given the substantially lower global oil prices, and average higher in 2021, within the earlier projected ranges."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence contains the phrase "is likely to," which indicates a degree of probability rather than a certainty. This suggests that the statement is not made with absolute confidence.

2. **Justification**: The use of "likely to" in the sentence introduces uncertainty regarding the future outcome of headline inflation.

Therefore, the classification output is:

2025-04-14 03:36:56,674 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and implications.

The sentence is: "the future thrust of monetary policy would depend on new information and our assessment of the change in the balance of risks to the medium term outlook for inflation and growth."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence indicates that the future direction of monetary policy is not fixed but is contingent upon future events and assessments. This implies a lack of certainty about the future actions or outcomes.

2. **Justification**: The sentence is uncertain because it explicitly states that the future of monetary policy depends on forthcoming information and assessments, indicating that the outcome is not predetermined.

Therefore,
2025-04-14 03:36:56,674 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "this will be done in a measured and gradual manner, ensuring that monetary policy remains accommodative to support a sustainable economic growth in an environment of price stability."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence is discussing a future action with a clear intention and conditions, but it involves future uncertainties and the use of terms like "measured and gradual manner" which imply a level of caution and adaptability to future conditions.

2. **Analysis**: The presence of words and phrases like "measured and gradual manner" and "ensuring" suggests a commitment to a certain course

2025-04-14 03:36:58,579 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, we need to analyze its content and tone to determine if it expresses certainty or uncertainty regarding the statement about the external sector benefiting from sustained global growth momentum.

The sentence is: "the external sector will continue to benefit from the sustained global growth momentum."

Let's break it down:

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence is making a statement about a future event ("will continue to benefit") based on an existing condition ("sustained global growth momentum"). The use of "will continue" indicates a prediction or expectation based on current trends.

2. **Certainty vs. Uncertainty**: The key to determining the label
2025-04-14 03:36:58,579 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "in particular, regional economies expanded strongly in the fourth quarter of 2009 and the growth momentum is expected to be sustained."

First, we observe that the sentence contains two main parts: a statement about the past ("expanded strongly in the fourth quarter of 2009") and an expectation about the future ("the growth momentum is expected to be sustained").

1. The first part of the sentence is a factual statement about the past, which is certain as it reports on something that has already happened.
   
2. The second part of the sentence expresses

The sentence is: "investment activity would be supported by continued progress of multi-year infrastructure projects."

1. **Understanding the Sentence**: The sentence talks about the potential support for investment activity due to the ongoing progress of multi-year infrastructure projects. It implies a conditional or expected outcome rather than a statement of fact.

2. **Identifying Certainty or Uncertainty**: 
   - The use of "would be supported" indicates a conditional or hypothetical scenario, suggesting that the outcome is not certain but dependent on certain conditions being met (in this case, the continued progress of infrastructure projects).
2025-04-14 03:36:58,579 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and implications.

The sentence is: "the deterioration in the world economy during the first quarter was worse than expected as the global financial turmoil became more prolonged."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence discusses a past event (deterioration in the world economy) in relation to expectations and another condition (global financial turmoil becoming more prolonged). The key phrases to focus on are "worse than expected" and "became more prolonged." The phrase "worse than expected" indicates a deviation from a forecast or anticipation, suggesting an element of uncertainty or surprise. However, the statement is
2025-04-14 03:36:58,579 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, we need to analyze its content and determine whether it expresses a certain or uncertain outcome regarding the upside risks to inflation.

The sentence is: "upside risks to inflation could however emerge in the event of supply disruptions that results in higher global prices for commodities."

Let's break it down:

1. The phrase "could however emerge" indicates a possibility rather than a certainty.
2. The condition "in the event of supply disruptions" further suggests that the outcome is dependent on a specific circumstance that may or may not occur.

Given these observations, the sentence is expressing a potential outcome that is contingent on certain conditions, rather
