A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "for 2016, headline inflation is expected to be higher, to peak in the first quarter and moderating thereafter."

Here's the step-by-step thought process:
1. The sentence mentions a specific year, "2016", which indicates a future time frame relative to the point of the statement (assuming the statement was made before 2016).
2. It discusses an expectation regarding "headline inflation" for that year, indicating a prediction or forecast.

2025-04-14 03:37:23,321 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, we need to analyze its content and determine whether it refers to future events or not.

The sentence is: "average headline inflation in 2019 will be low".

1. The sentence is making a statement about a future event relative to the time it is presumably being made (since the exact date isn't specified, we infer based on the context that it's likely being made before 2019).
2. The key phrase "will be" indicates a prediction or expectation about the future.

Given these observations, the sentence is clearly referring to a future condition or event.

Therefore, the classification should be as follows:
