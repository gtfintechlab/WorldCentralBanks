A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses uncertainty about the future implications of downside risks in the global economic and financial environment on domestic price stability and growth."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it uses phrases such as "recognises that there are downside risks" and "is closely monitoring and assessing their implications", which indicate that the outcome is not known with certainty.
2025-04-14 03:28:29,454 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence uses definitive language, such as 'will continue to provide', indicating a high degree of confidence and certainty about the future outcome."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "certain" because it uses assertive and predictive language, implying that the outcome is expected to happen with a high degree of confidence.
2025-04-14 03:28:29,454 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a specific decision made by the MPC, indicating a definitive action taken based on an improved economic outlook."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "certain" because it states a clear and specific action that was taken by the MPC, without any ambiguity or indication of doubt.
2025-04-14 03:28:29,454 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a definitive action that the MPC will take, indicated by the phrase 'will continue to monitor and assess'."
}
```

However, upon re-reading, I realize that the sentence is actually talking about future actions and there is a degree of uncertainty associated with future events. Therefore, I revise my answer:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a future intention or plan, and the outcome or actual actions may be influenced by various factors, making the statement uncertain."
}
2025-04-14 03:28:29,454 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my response:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates that monetary policy decisions will depend on evolving conditions, implying a lack of predetermined outcomes and therefore uncertainty."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it suggests that the monetary policy decisions will be made based on future developments and changing circumstances, rather than a fixed plan. This implies a degree of uncertainty about the future course of monetary policy.

  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words and phrases with uncertain connotations, such as 'have increased significantly', 'have subsided', and 'as slower growth sets in', which indicate a degree of unpredictability and ambiguity."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it contains words and phrases that imply a level of uncertainty, such as "have increased significantly", "have subsided", and "as slower growth sets in". These phrases suggest that the situation is dynamic and subject to change, and that the outcomes are not entirely predictable.

```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it expresses a prediction or expectation about future events (e.g., "the growth momentum is expected to improve") rather than stating a fact. The use of words like "expected" and "supported" implies a degree of uncertainty or conditionality, which is characteristic of uncertain statements.

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it expresses a prediction or expectation about future events, rather than stating a fact. The use of words like "will provide" and "further impetus" implies a degree of uncertainty and conditionality, suggesting that the outcome is not guaranteed.

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it expresses a prediction or forecast about future events, which are inherently uncertain. The use of phrases like "looking ahead" and "will continue to constrain" suggests that the outcome is not guaranteed, making the statement uncertain rather than certain.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'expected' and 'more stable', which indicate a degree of uncertainty and prediction rather than a statement of fact."
}
```

This sentence is classified as uncertain because it expresses a prediction or expectation about future events (the contribution of lower international oil prices and moderating inflation to an environment of more stable domestic consumer prices) rather than stating a known fact.
2025-04-14 03:28:58,132 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence uses the phrase 'latest indicators point towards' which implies a level of confidence and factual basis, indicating a certain tone."
}
```

However, I can also argue that it is uncertain because it talks about "indicators point towards" which implies a level of prediction or likelihood rather than a definitive fact.

2025-04-14 03:28:58,132 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses uncertainty due to the presence of conditional phrases and uncertain factors such as 'dependent on', 'as well as', and 'continues to be highly dependent'."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "uncertain" because it mentions several factors that may affect the outlook, implying that the outcome is not guaranteed. The use of phrases like "highly dependent on", "as well as", and "continues to be" suggests that there are uncertainties and variables that may influence the outcome, making the sentence uncertain.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a cautious tone and mentions potential future effects, indicating uncertainty about the inflation outlook."
}

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it implies that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is monitoring various factors that could potentially affect the inflation outlook, but it does not provide a definitive statement about the future. The use of phrases such as "remains vigilant" and "that could affect" suggests a sense of caution and uncertainty.
