A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence primarily discusses current or past trends and conditions, without expressing expectations or projections about future events or outcomes."
}
```

I chose "not forward looking" because the sentence focuses on describing the current state of various sectors and factors, such as the recovery in the electrical and electronics sector, the softness of global trade, and the shift in spending from goods to services, without mentioning what is expected to happen in the future.

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses potential future implications of current economic conditions on the domestic economy, indicating a forward-looking perspective."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "forward looking" because it mentions potential future risks and implications of current economic conditions on the domestic economy, using phrases such as "heightened the risk of slower global growth and its potential implications on the domestic economy". This indicates that the sentence is discussing possible future outcomes rather than simply describing current events.
