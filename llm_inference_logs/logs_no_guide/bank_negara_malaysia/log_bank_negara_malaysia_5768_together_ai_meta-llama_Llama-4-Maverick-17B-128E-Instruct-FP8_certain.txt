A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "however, upside risks to inflation could emerge should supply disruptions result in higher global prices for commodities."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence implies a potential future condition ("could emerge") that is dependent on another condition ("should supply disruptions result in higher global prices for commodities"). This indicates a level of uncertainty because it discusses a possibility rather than a certainty.

2. **Justification**: The use of "could emerge" and "should" indicates conditionality and uncertainty about the occurrence of the event, suggesting that the statement is uncertain.

Therefore, the classification

The sentence is: "the decline in prices largely reflects the cumulative fall in fuel prices since june 2008 and the easing pressure on food prices."

1. **Understanding the task**: We need to determine if the sentence is certain or uncertain regarding its tone and content about the Bank Negara Malaysia's monetary policy meeting.

2. **Analyzing the sentence**: The sentence discusses a specific economic observation (decline in prices) and attributes it to two main factors: the fall in fuel prices since June 2008 and the easing pressure on food prices. The language used is

Let's break it down:

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence contains the word "expected," which indicates a prediction or forecast rather than a statement of fact. This suggests that there is some level of uncertainty involved.

2. **Justification**: The use of "expected" and the context of discussing future inflation indicate that the statement is about a forecast or

The sentence is: "however, the absence of external price pressures and more moderate demand conditions are expected to mitigate the impact of these cost factors on the underlying inflation."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence contains the word "expected," which indicates a level of prediction or anticipation rather than a statement of fact. This suggests that the outcome is not certain but rather dependent on certain conditions being met.

2. **Justification**: The use of "are expected to" in the sentence introduces an element of uncertainty because it refers to a future projection rather than a current or past fact
