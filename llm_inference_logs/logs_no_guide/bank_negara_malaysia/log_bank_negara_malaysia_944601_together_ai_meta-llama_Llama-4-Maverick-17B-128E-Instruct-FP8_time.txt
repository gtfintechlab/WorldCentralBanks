A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "on the external front, the expected improvement in exports will provide some support to growth."

Let's break it down:

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence mentions "the expected improvement in exports," which indicates a future event or condition. The use of "expected" suggests anticipation or prediction of something that has not yet occurred but is likely to occur. Furthermore, it talks about the impact of this expected improvement on "growth," implying a future effect.
