A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual update on the Malaysian economy's performance without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance."
}
```

The sentence simply reports on the economy's sustained performance without suggesting any concerns about inflation (which would be hawkish) or growth (which would be dovish), so it is neutral.
2025-04-14 03:32:48,634 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The reduction of the overnight policy rate by 25 basis points indicates a loosening of monetary policy, which is a dovish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that a rate cut is a sign of a dovish monetary policy stance, as it aims to stimulate economic growth by making borrowing cheaper.
2025-04-14 03:32:48,634 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The reduction of the overnight policy rate by 75 basis points indicates an accommodative monetary policy stance, which is characteristic of a dovish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that a rate cut, especially a significant one like 75 basis points, signals that the central bank is trying to stimulate economic growth and ease monetary policy, which is a dovish stance.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses concerns about policy uncertainties and potential sharp financial market adjustments, indicating a cautious tone that is typically associated with a dovish monetary policy stance."

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a positive but non-committal outlook on the economy, suggesting no immediate need for a change in monetary policy."

I classified the sentence as "neutral" because it presents a balanced and optimistic view of the economy's growth prospects without hinting at any specific policy action or bias. This type of statement is typically associated with a neutral monetary policy stance.

  "justification": "The sentence describes a neutral state of financial markets, without indicating any inclination towards tightening or loosening monetary policy."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "neutral" because it simply states that financial markets have been calm, without suggesting any specific direction for monetary policy. There is no indication of a hawkish (tightening) or dovish (loosening) stance, making "neutral" the most suitable label.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a neutral observation about the global economic activity without indicating any specific direction for monetary policy."
}
```

The sentence simply states that global economic activity is showing signs of improvement, but at an uneven pace, without suggesting any specific action or bias towards tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) monetary policy. Therefore, it is classified as neutral.
2025-04-14 03:32:51,924 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that inflation is expected to remain modest, implying a balanced view on the economy, which is consistent with a neutral monetary policy stance."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence does not indicate a strong concern about inflation (which would be hawkish) or a need to stimulate the economy (which would be dovish). Instead, it presents a balanced view, suggesting that the current monetary policy stance is likely to remain unchanged, which is characteristic of a neutral stance.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that weaker economic conditions will reduce inflationary pressures, implying a more accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "dovish" because it implies that the economic conditions are weak enough to mitigate inflationary pressures, which is a concern that is typically associated with a more dovish or accommodative monetary policy stance.
2025-04-14 03:32:54,827 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a negative economic outlook, which could justify a loosening of monetary policy, indicating a dovish stance."
}
```

The sentence implies that the economy is facing challenges, such as a decline in external demand, contraction in exports, and moderation in private investment activity. This kind of language often precedes or supports a dovish monetary policy decision, which typically involves lowering interest rates or implementing other expansionary measures to stimulate the economy. Therefore, I classified the sentence as dovish.

{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides an economic outlook without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance, thus it is neutral."
}
```

The sentence discusses the expected growth in exports due to the global tech upcycle and Malaysia's position in the semiconductor supply chain, but it does not provide any information that would suggest a tightening or loosening of monetary policy, hence it is classified as neutral.

{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual update on inflation trends without indicating a shift in monetary policy bias, hence a neutral stance."

{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a strong economy, which could lead to inflationary pressures and a need for tighter monetary policy, indicating a hawkish stance."

  "justification": "The sentence mentions that some central banks have started monetary policy easing, indicating a loosening of monetary policy, which is a dovish stance."

This type of language is often used by central banks to signal that they are prepared to take action to mitigate potential economic risks, which is consistent with a

{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides an objective statement about the expected performance of exports without implying any change in monetary policy, thus maintaining a neutral tone."

```

I classified the sentence as "neutral" because it simply provides an outlook on exports without suggesting any specific action or bias regarding monetary policy, which would be required to classify it as hawkish (implying tighter monetary policy) or dovish (implying looser monetary policy). The sentence's tone is informative and does not convey a clear direction that would influence expectations about future monetary policy decisions

I classified the sentence as "dovish" because it implies that the current economic conditions, such as lower international oil prices and moderating inflation in trade partner economies, will contribute to stable domestic consumer prices, which could support a more accommodative monetary policy. This tone is consistent with a dovish stance, which tends to prioritize economic growth and stability over inflation concerns.

* Neutral: implies no change in monetary policy.
* Irrelevant: implies the sentence does not relate to monetary policy.

{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a cautious tone regarding global growth, implying a potential easing of monetary policy, which is characteristic of a dovish stance."

The sentence implies a concern for downside risks to global growth, which is often associated with a dovish monetary policy stance, as it may lead to a more accommodative policy to mitigate these risks.

In this classification, I considered the following:

* "Upside risks to inflation" implies that the speaker is concerned about potential inflationary pressures.
* The mention of potential supply disruptions and higher global commodity prices suggests that the speaker is vigilant about inflation risks.
* The tone is cautious and forward-looking, which is consistent with a hawkish monetary policy stance.

{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a positive outlook for economic activity, implying that the central bank may maintain or ease its monetary policy stance, which is a dovish signal."

```

I classified the sentence as "dovish" because it implies a positive economic outlook, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance. This is a dovish signal, as it suggests that the central bank may be inclined to keep interest rates low or even cut them to support economic growth.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",

I classified the sentence as "neutral" because it simply states the current situation of investment activity without suggesting any tightening or loosening of monetary policy, which is a key aspect of hawkish or dovish stances. The sentence does not convey any clear implication for future monetary policy actions, hence it is considered neutral.
