A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "going forward, the lower cost pressures and the slowdown in demand are expected to exert a greater dampening influence on inflation."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence is discussing a future expectation regarding the influence of certain economic factors on inflation. The key phrase here is "are expected to," which indicates a prediction or forecast rather than a statement of fact.

2. **Justification**: The use of "are expected to" suggests that the outcome is anticipated based on current trends or analysis, rather than being a certainty. This indicates that the statement is

The sentence is: "in the domestic economy, a broad set of indicators suggests robust expansion in the fourth quarter of 2012."

Let's break it down:

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence uses the phrase "a broad set of indicators suggests," which indicates a level of confidence or evidence-based assertion rather than absolute certainty or doubt.

2. **Justification**: The word "suggests" is a key indicator here. It

The sentence is: "on the external front, the expected improvement in exports will provide some support to growth."

Let's break it down:

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence uses the word "expected," which indicates a future prediction rather than a fact. It also states that the improvement "will provide some support," which suggests a degree of certainty about the outcome but is tempered by the word "some," indicating a limited or conditional support.

2. **Justification
2025-04-14 09:49:41,363 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze it step by step.

The sentence is: "with the domestic growth on a firmer footing, the mpc decided to begin reducing the degree of monetary accommodation."

1. **Understanding the sentence**: The sentence discusses a decision made by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of Bank Negara Malaysia regarding monetary accommodation. It implies that the MPC has taken a specific action based on the state of domestic growth.

2. **Identifying certainty or uncertainty**: The key elements to look for are the tone, language, and context that suggest either a definitive action or a speculative/conditional one. The phrase "the MPC

The sentence is: "the impact of subsidy adjustments on consumption spending is expected to be contained by targeted financial assistance."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence is discussing an expectation regarding the impact of a specific economic policy (subsidy adjustments and targeted financial assistance) on consumption spending. The use of "is expected to be contained" indicates a degree of prediction or anticipation rather than a statement of fact.

2. **Justification**: The phrase "is expected to be" suggests a level of uncertainty because it refers to a future outcome that has not yet occurred, implying that

The sentence is: "the inflation rate is expected to edge upwards in the next few months, before moderating in the later part of 2005".

1. The sentence uses the phrase "is expected to," which indicates a prediction or forecast rather than a statement of fact. This kind of language typically introduces uncertainty because it refers to future events or outcomes that are not yet known.

2. The subject matter involves forecasting the inflation rate, which is inherently uncertain due to the complexities and unpredictabilities of economic factors.
