A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words and phrases with uncertain meanings, such as 'might be close to zero' and 'unfavourable', indicating a lack of certainty about future economic activity."
}
```

The sentence is classified as "uncertain" because it uses phrases that convey a degree of uncertainty, such as "might be close to zero" and "unfavourable", which suggest that the outcome is not guaranteed or predictable.
2025-04-15 00:07:54,180 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific fact about the concerns of surveyed households, indicating a clear and definite observation."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents a factual statement about the concerns of surveyed households, without any ambiguity or uncertainty. The use of "it was pointed out" and "had risen recently" suggests a clear and specific observation, which supports the classification as certain.
2025-04-15 00:07:54,181 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence presents information as supported by specific data (march NBP projection) and does not contain words or phrases that indicate doubt or uncertainty."

2025-04-15 00:07:54,181 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains phrases such as 'most likely' and 'would see a fall', which indicate uncertainty rather than certainty."
}
```

This classification is based on the presence of words and phrases that express doubt or probability, rather than definitive statements. The use of "most likely" and "would see a fall" suggests that the outcome is not guaranteed, but rather predicted with some degree of uncertainty.
2025-04-15 00:07:54,181 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific statement about GDP growth in the German economy, indicating a factual claim rather than a speculative or uncertain one."
}
```

I chose "certain" because the sentence presents information as a fact, without any hedging or ambiguity, and it quotes a specific statement made about economic data.

{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains conditional language ('in the case of') and a modal verb ('might'), indicating uncertainty about the future event."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "uncertain" because it expresses a potential outcome that may or may not happen, depending on a specific condition (adjustment of electricity prices). The use of "might" also indicates a possibility rather than a certainty.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'probably' and 'subdued', indicating a degree of uncertainty about the future GDP growth rate."
}
```

The presence of the word "probably" explicitly suggests uncertainty, and "subdued" implies a range of possible outcomes rather than a definitive prediction, leading to the classification as uncertain.

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it contains phrases that indicate a degree of uncertainty or possibility, rather than a statement of fact. The use of "some council members emphasised" suggests that not all members shared the same view, and "should gradually decrease" implies a prediction or expectation rather than a certainty.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a conditional or potential future scenario using phrases like 'in the opinion of some council members', indicating a lack of certainty."
}
```

The sentence is classified as "uncertain" because it uses phrases like "in the opinion of some council members" and "will run below", which indicate a degree of uncertainty or conditionality. This suggests that the outcome is not guaranteed, but rather a prediction or expectation based on certain views or assumptions.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports past events and relationships using definite language, indicating a factual and certain tone."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it describes specific past events and relationships using definite language, without any expressions of doubt or uncertainty. The use of phrases such as "it was pointed out", "was related", and "took place" suggests a factual report, which supports the classification as certain.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports specific facts about the discussion at the National Bank of Poland's monetary policy meeting without expressing any doubt or ambiguity."
}
```
2025-04-15 00:08:03,843 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a risk or possibility of slow economic growth persisting, rather than a definite fact, indicating uncertainty."
}
```

This classification is based on the presence of the word "risk" and the phrase "pointed to the risk", which implies that the outcome is not guaranteed, but rather possible or likely. This language suggests uncertainty, rather than certainty.

{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'might have' and 'in their opinion', which indicate uncertainty and subjective interpretation."

The sentence is classified as "uncertain" because it expresses a potential effect ("might have") and cites the opinion of council members, rather than stating a fact or a definitive outcome.
2025-04-15 00:08:04,975 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains conditional language and speculative phrases, such as 'should' and 'risk of', indicating uncertainty about future events."
}
```

This sentence is classified as uncertain because it expresses a potential risk or possibility rather than a fact or a certainty. The use of words like "should" and "risk of" implies that the outcome is not guaranteed, and the sentence is discussing a hypothetical scenario.

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it uses a definitive statement about the future ("inflation would be low") and lacks words or phrases that indicate uncertainty, such as "may", "could", or "it is likely that". The sentence presents a clear and confident prediction, suggesting that the speaker is certain about the future inflation trend.

```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it uses phrases such as "did not rule out", "should the incoming data confirm", and "should the risk... remain limited", which indicate that the future decision is contingent on uncertain factors and is therefore uncertain.
