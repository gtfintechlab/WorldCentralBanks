A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence mentions that "the wage growth in the enterprise sector had been low and the real wage fund had declined." This information can be seen as having implications for inflation and economic growth, which are key considerations in monetary policy decisions.

- **Hawkish** refers to a monetary policy stance that is focused on controlling inflation, often implying higher interest rates or a tightening of policy.
- **Dovish** refers to a stance that prioritizes economic growth and employment, often implying lower interest rates or an easing of policy.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The mention of a decline in CPI inflation to 2.4% in December 2012 suggests a concern for low inflation, which is a dovish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the idea that a dovish monetary policy stance is associated with a focus on stimulating the economy and keeping inflation low, whereas a hawkish stance is associated with a focus on controlling inflation and potentially raising interest rates. A neutral stance implies no clear bias towards tightening or easing monetary policy. In this case, the sentence implies that the

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that inflation is likely to remain below the projected level, which could imply a less aggressive monetary policy stance, consistent with a dovish tone."
}
```

In this classification, I labeled the sentence as "dovish" because it implies that the council members are expecting inflation to be under control, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy. This is a characteristic of a dovish stance, which tends to prioritize economic growth and employment over inflation concerns.
2025-04-15 00:12:23,272 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a concern about a potential economic impact, but does not explicitly mention monetary policy or interest rates, indicating a neutral stance."
}
```

The sentence discusses a potential risk related to labor supply but does not directly advocate for or against changes in interest rates or monetary policy, hence it's classified as neutral.
2025-04-15 00:12:23,272 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a neutral description of economic conditions in Poland without implying any specific monetary policy action or bias."
}
```

The sentence simply states that the economic conditions in Poland were relatively good, without suggesting any implications for monetary policy, which is why I classified it as "neutral".
2025-04-15 00:12:23,272 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a cautious view on the impact of easing lending standards on household lending, implying a balanced approach to monetary policy."
}
```

The sentence does not indicate a clear intention to tighten (hawkish) or loosen (dovish) monetary policy, but rather provides a nuanced assessment of the effects of a potential policy change, which aligns with a neutral stance.
2025-04-15 00:12:23,272 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence mentions the possibility of interest rate cuts, which is a characteristic of a dovish monetary policy stance. A dovish stance is associated with a more accommodative or expansionary monetary policy, which is often signaled by talk of potential rate cuts to support the economy.

2025-04-15 00:12:24,862 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance of the given sentence and provide a concise justification, let's analyze the content:

The sentence discusses the potential for short-lived and small-scale economic phenomena in the United States, mentioning factors like the weakening of the dollar exchange rate, high profitability of enterprises, and the significant contribution of the service sector to GDP. It reflects a consideration of economic conditions that could influence policy decisions but does not directly indicate a tightening, loosening, or a neutral stance on monetary policy.

However, the discussion seems to lean towards not perceiving a significant downside risk or a need for immediate action, as it suggests that the lower activity could be
2025-04-15 00:12:24,862 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance of the given sentence and provide a concise justification, let's analyze it step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the context
The sentence mentions a discussion related to the output gap closing earlier than expected due to an acceleration in consumption growth. This context is about the potential state of the economy and how it might influence monetary policy decisions.

## 2: Identify key elements
The key elements in the sentence are "a rise in probability that the output gap might close earlier than previously expected" and "a likely acceleration in consumption growth." These elements suggest that the economy is performing better than previously anticipated.

2025-04-15 00:12:24,862 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The mention of outflow of portfolio capital and lower relative attractiveness of investing in Polish treasury bonds suggests a concern about economic conditions, which is a dovish stance."
}
```

This sentence implies that the National Bank of Poland might be concerned about the economic situation and potential capital outflows, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy, hence the dovish classification.
2025-04-15 00:12:24,862 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions uncertainty in global financial markets, but does not express a clear inclination towards tightening or loosening monetary policy."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence highlights the uncertainty and unpredictability of exchange rate fluctuations, but does not convey a clear stance on monetary policy, nor does it suggest a specific direction for future policy actions.
2025-04-15 00:12:24,862 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The mention of a persistently low unemployment rate suggests concerns about potential inflationary pressures, which is a hawkish stance."
}
```

In this case, the sentence implies that the low unemployment rate might lead to inflation, which is a concern typically associated with a hawkish monetary policy stance, which tends to prioritize controlling inflation over stimulating economic growth.

2025-04-15 00:12:26,457 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance of the given sentence and provide a justification, let's analyze it step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the context of the sentence
The sentence mentions "a strong increase in commodity prices in the world markets associated with rising demand from the emerging economies." This context suggests an external factor (rising commodity prices) that could influence inflation.

## 2: Determine the implications of the sentence for monetary policy
A strong increase in commodity prices, often associated with higher production costs and potentially higher inflation, can be a concern for central banks. Typically, central banks might consider tightening monetary policy (hawkish stance) to

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates that the majority of the council members supported continuing to lower interest rates, which is a sign of an accommodative monetary policy stance, characteristic of a dovish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence mentions the majority of the council members supporting a continuation of lowering interest rates, which is a typical characteristic of a dovish monetary policy stance. A dovish stance is associated with a preference for low interest rates to stimulate economic growth, even if it means tolerating higher inflation.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The council's decision to set the interest rates with minimal changes suggests a neutral stance, as it neither significantly tightens nor loosens monetary policy."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the changes in interest rates are relatively small and don't indicate a significant shift towards tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) monetary policy. The rates seem to be adjusted slightly, but overall, the change is minimal, suggesting no strong inclination towards either hawkish or dovish stance.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence is discussing a neutral factor (adverse weather conditions) that could have a temporary negative impact on economic activity, without expressing a clear stance on monetary policy."
}
```

This sentence does not express a clear stance on monetary policy, nor it suggests a change in the policy. The focus is on an external factor (weather conditions) that might have affected economic activity, which is a neutral observation. Therefore, I classified it as "neutral".
2025-04-15 00:12:28,086 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions a decline in monetary policy restrictiveness driven by interest rate cuts and a weakening of the zloty exchange rate, indicating a loosening of monetary policy."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that a decline in monetary policy restrictiveness, driven by interest rate cuts and a weakening of the exchange rate, suggests that the monetary policy stance is becoming more accommodative, which is a characteristic of a dovish stance.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides factual information about labor market trends without expressing a clear stance on monetary policy."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "neutral" because it simply reports on labor market data without indicating a specific direction for monetary policy, nor does it suggest concerns about inflation (hawkish) or economic growth (dovish).
2025-04-15 00:12:28,086 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a decrease in inflation, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance, indicating a dovish tone."
}
```

The reasoning behind this classification is that the sentence mentions a decline in annual CPI inflation, which is a key indicator of price stability. A decrease in inflation can be seen as a positive development, and the mention of this data point may suggest that the National Bank of Poland may be more likely to ease monetary policy or maintain a accommodative stance, which is consistent with a dovish tone.
2025-04-15 00:12:28,086 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my response:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses the economic consequences of deflation in a neutral and analytical tone, without indicating a clear inclination towards tightening or loosening monetary policy."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "neutral" because it presents a factual and objective analysis of deflation's consequences without expressing a clear policy bias. The sentence does not suggest a hawkish (inflation-fighting) or dovish (growth-supporting) stance, and it is relevant to the topic of monetary policy.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a subdued GDP growth rate, implying that the economy may need accommodative monetary policy, which is a dovish stance."
}
```

This sentence implies that the economy is expected to continue growing at a slow pace, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy, hence the dovish classification.

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that the National Bank of Poland is concerned about inflation running above target, implying a potentially tighter monetary policy stance."

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests concerns about potential inflationary pressures from rising unit labour costs, indicating a cautious or tightening monetary policy stance."
}
```

The sentence implies that the speaker is concerned about the potential for wage growth to lead to higher unit labour costs, which could be seen as a threat to price stability. This concern is typically associated with a hawkish monetary policy stance, which prioritizes controlling inflation over stimulating economic growth.
2025-04-15 00:12:40,117 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses potential economic risks without expressing a clear stance on monetary policy, indicating a neutral tone."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence presents a balanced view of potential economic risks without advocating for a specific policy action, such as raising or lowering interest rates, which is characteristic of a hawkish or dovish stance, respectively.
2025-04-15 00:12:40,117 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions inflation returning close to the target, but does not indicate a change in policy or a strong emphasis on inflation, suggesting a neutral stance."
}
```

The sentence seems to be simply stating a fact about inflation projections and does not contain language that would suggest a hawkish (concerned about inflation and potentially raising interest rates) or dovish (concerned about growth and potentially lowering interest rates) stance. Therefore, I classified it as neutral.
2025-04-15 00:12:40,117 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence focuses on the nature of inflation expectations in Poland and their interpretation, without explicitly indicating a tightening or loosening of monetary policy."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence seems to be discussing the characteristics of inflation expectations and their implications for monetary policy interpretation, rather than advocating for a specific policy action. There is no clear indication of a hawkish (favoring higher interest rates) or dovish (favoring lower interest rates) stance.
2025-04-15 00:12:40,117 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance of the given sentence and provide a brief justification, let's analyze it step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Sentence
The sentence discusses the growth in consumption in the coming quarters being driven by the emerging effects of an acceleration in disbursement of child benefits.

## 2: Identify Key Elements
The key elements here are "growth in consumption" and "disbursement of child benefits." This suggests an expectation of increased economic activity, potentially due to fiscal policy measures (in this case, child benefits) rather than monetary policy directly.

## 3: Relate to Monetary Policy Stance

2025-04-15 00:12:41,686 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance of the given sentence and provide a justification, let's analyze it step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the sentence
The sentence provided is: "at the same time, as the effects of those shocks waned, price growth would gradually increase." This sentence implies that as temporary factors (shocks) that may have been suppressing or affecting price growth diminish, there will be a gradual increase in price growth, which can be interpreted as inflation.

## 2: Interpret the implications for monetary policy
- A "hawkish" stance refers to a preference for controlling inflation, often through higher interest rates

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a consideration of potential factors influencing inflation, but does not indicate a clear inclination towards tightening or loosening monetary policy."
}
```

The sentence seems to be discussing potential factors that could influence inflation in Poland, but it doesn't express a clear stance on monetary policy. The mention of certain council members' opinions does not imply a strong hawkish (favoring higher interest rates) or dovish (favoring lower interest rates) stance, hence the classification as "neutral".

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that pausing monetary policy tightening could lead to moral hazard, implying a cautious approach to easing policy and a potential concern about inflation or financial stability."
}
```

In this classification, I labeled the sentence as "hawkish" because it implies a concern about the potential risks of easing monetary policy, such as moral hazard, and suggests that the National Bank of Poland might be cautious about loosening policy in the future. This tone is consistent with a hawkish stance, which prioritizes inflation control and financial stability over economic growth
2025-04-15 00:12:43,195 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance of the given sentence and provide a concise justification, let's analyze it step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the context of the sentence
The sentence mentions the National Bank of Poland's monetary policy meeting, specifically focusing on the council members' opinions regarding growing demand and the growth in oil prices.

## 2: Identify key elements of the sentence
The key elements are: (1) "growing demand," (2) "growth in oil prices," and (3) the council members' opinion that growth in oil prices "should slow down."

## 3: Interpret the council members' opinion
2025-04-15 00:12:43,195 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual assessment of the economy without indicating a clear inclination towards tightening or loosening monetary policy."
}
```

The sentence presents a balanced view of the economy, mentioning positive signs such as growing capacity utilization and expected GDP growth acceleration, but does not suggest any specific action or bias towards a more restrictive or accommodative monetary policy stance. Therefore, I classify it as "neutral".
2025-04-15 00:12:43,195 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The statement suggests that the council members are not concerned about inflation, which implies a more accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the idea that a "dovish" stance is associated with a more relaxed attitude towards inflation and a greater emphasis on economic growth, which is consistent with the council members' view that inflationary pressure is limited.
2025-04-15 00:12:43,195 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions a neutral discussion about the zloty appreciation and its potential causes, without indicating a clear inclination towards tightening or loosening monetary policy."
}
```

The sentence seems to be discussing a neutral topic, analyzing the potential reasons behind the zloty appreciation, without expressing a clear stance on monetary policy. There is no indication of a hawkish (favoring tighter monetary policy) or dovish (favoring looser monetary policy) tone. Therefore, I classified it as "neutral".

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that some members of the council are in favor of easing monetary policy, which indicates a dovish stance."
}
```

The reasoning behind this classification is that the sentence mentions "easing of the monetary policy" which implies a dovish stance, as it suggests reducing interest rates to stimulate the economy. The fact that the easing should be implemented gradually does not change the overall dovish tone of the statement.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence reports on economic indicators without expressing a clear stance on monetary policy, hence it is neutral."
}
```

The sentence simply states a fact about economic indicators (industrial output growth and retail sales growth) without implying any specific action or direction for monetary policy, which suggests a neutral stance. There is no indication of a hawkish (concerned about inflation and potentially raising interest rates) or dovish (focused on economic growth and potentially lowering interest rates) tone. Therefore, the label "neutral" is assigned.

{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions a potential increase in wage growth, but does not explicitly imply a change in monetary policy or a specific stance on inflation or interest rates."
}

I classified the sentence as "neutral" because it simply states a factual observation about potential wage growth without expressing a clear opinion or intention that would lean towards a hawkish (concerned about inflation and potentially raising interest rates) or dovish (focused on growth and potentially lowering interest rates) stance.
2025-04-15 00:12:50,876 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance of the given sentence and provide a justification, let's analyze it step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Sentence
The sentence provided is: "the rise occurred despite the ebc's public sector purchase programme". This sentence mentions a specific event (a rise, likely in interest rates or market indicators) happening in spite of the European Central Bank's (ECB) public sector purchase programme, which is a form of quantitative easing.

## 2: Recall Monetary Policy Stances
- **Hawkish**: A hawkish stance indicates a preference for tighter monetary policy, possibly to curb inflation,

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that a decline in global commodity prices will lead to lower price growth, implying a potential easing of monetary policy, which is a dovish stance."
}
```

This sentence implies that the speaker expects lower inflation due to decreasing commodity prices, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy, characteristic of a dovish stance.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The statement highlights subdued economic growth in the euro-area, suggesting a potentially accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

The sentence is classified as "dovish" because it emphasizes the relatively small improvement in economic climate and forecast economic growth below potential, which may indicate a need for supportive monetary policy, consistent with a dovish stance.
2025-04-15 00:12:52,314 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence highlights downside risks to economic growth, suggesting a accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

The sentence mentions deterioration of the labour market, capital shortfall of some euro area banks, and hampered growth of the euro area economy, which are all factors that would lead to a dovish monetary policy stance, as they suggest a need for accommodative policies to support economic growth.
2025-04-15 00:12:52,314 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a cautious tone, highlighting weakened economic conditions and persistent uncertainty, which is consistent with a dovish monetary policy stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence focuses on negative economic conditions and uncertainty, which is typically associated with a dovish stance, implying that the central bank may be inclined to implement expansionary monetary policies to mitigate these risks.
2025-04-15 00:12:52,314 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that the National Bank of Poland expects inflation to be curbed by moderate economic growth, implying a relatively accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the understanding that:

* "Hawkish" refers to a monetary policy stance that prioritizes inflation control, often implying higher interest rates.
* "Dovish" refers to a monetary policy stance that prioritizes economic growth, often implying lower interest rates or accommodative policies.
* "Neutral" refers to a balanced monetary policy stance that neither priorit
2025-04-15 00:12:52,315 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a moderate economic growth outlook without indicating a need for immediate policy easing or tightening, implying a neutral stance."
}
```

The sentence does not indicate a clear direction for monetary policy, nor does it suggest that the council is considering changing the policy stance. The assessment of moderate economic growth without mentioning inflation or other factors that might prompt a policy change leads to a classification of "neutral".

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply reports on the state of the global economy and the council's observations without expressing a clear bias towards a more hawkish (tightening) or dovish (loosening) monetary policy stance.
2025-04-15 00:12:53,786 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The statement implies that the council members are downplaying the need for tight monetary policy, suggesting a more accommodative stance."
}
```

The reasoning behind this classification is that the sentence highlights factors beyond the direct impact of monetary policy (regulated prices) as the cause of higher inflation in Poland, which could suggest that the council members are not considering aggressive monetary policy actions to address inflation, characteristic of a dovish stance.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides an objective observation about investment growth without indicating a change in monetary policy or a clear inclination towards tightening or easing."
}
```

The sentence seems to be simply stating a fact about the economy and does not convey a clear stance on monetary policy, hence the classification as "neutral".

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The statement suggests that wage growth should not be too low, implying a cautious approach to monetary policy and potentially limiting further stimulus, which is a hawkish stance."
}
```

In this classification, I considered "hawkish" to be the appropriate label because the sentence implies that some council members are concerned about wage growth being too low and want to ensure it doesn't run close to historical lows, which could indicate a desire to keep inflation in check and maintain a tighter monetary policy stance. This is consistent with a hawkish monetary policy stance
2025-04-15 00:12:53,786 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The statement focuses on the outlook for economic growth without indicating any inclination towards tightening or loosening monetary policy, suggesting a neutral stance."
}
```

The sentence provided does not indicate any concern about inflation (which would be hawkish) or suggest a need for stimulus (which would be dovish). Instead, it presents a fairly neutral view of economic growth, suggesting that the current pace will continue. This kind of statement is often seen as neutral in terms of monetary policy stance.

```

This classification is based on the fact that a "hawkish" stance is characterized by a concern for inflation and a willingness to raise interest rates to combat it, which aligns with the sentiment expressed in the sentence.
2025-04-15 00:12:55,479 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```

## Step 1: Understand the context
The sentence mentions the council members discussing government measures aimed at shielding mortgage borrowers. This context suggests a focus on protecting borrowers, which could imply a consideration for the economic well-being of citizens and potentially an influence on monetary policy decisions.

## 2: Identify key elements
The key elements here are "government measures" and "shielding mortgage borrowers." These actions typically involve some form of financial support or protection, which can be seen as a way to stimulate economic growth or mitigate financial stress

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that the members support increasing interest rates to combat accelerating price growth, indicating a hawkish stance focused on inflation control."
