A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

2025-04-15 00:21:55,076 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and context.

The sentence is: "the majority of council members assessed that despite the observed economic recovery, demand and cost pressures in the polish economy remained low, which, amidst weakened economic conditions and falling inflation pressure abroad, supported lower domestic inflation."

This sentence discusses the assessment made by the council members regarding the current state of the Polish economy and its inflation, referencing observed conditions and their impact on domestic inflation. It does not explicitly mention future actions, expectations, or predictions that would directly indicate a forward-looking perspective. Instead, it focuses on the current or past assessment and conditions.

The sentence is: "some council members observed that besides changes in the trade policy of key economies, it was probably the tendency of slowdown in economic growth after years of expansion that negatively affected activity in many countries."

First, we need to understand what "forward looking" means in the context of monetary policy discussions. Forward-looking statements typically refer to future expectations, predictions, or guidance related to economic conditions, policy decisions, or their outcomes.

The sentence is: "during the discussion, the council pointed out that weakening of external economic activity, in particular in germany, translated into a pronounced deceleration in polish exports growth."

First, we need to understand what "forward looking" means in the context of monetary policy discussions. Forward-looking statements typically refer to future expectations, predictions, or decisions that will affect future outcomes.

Let's break down the sentence:
- It mentions "during the discussion," indicating it is about a past event or meeting.

2025-04-15 00:22:30,424 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and context.

The sentence discusses certain economic factors (limited scale of lending, bad situation in the real estate market, and high budget deficit) that are considered risks to a "permanent recovery of economic growth in the United States." The key elements here are the identification of current or existing risk factors and their potential impact on future economic growth.

Given this, the sentence implies a consideration of how current conditions might affect future economic outcomes, which aligns with a forward-looking perspective.
