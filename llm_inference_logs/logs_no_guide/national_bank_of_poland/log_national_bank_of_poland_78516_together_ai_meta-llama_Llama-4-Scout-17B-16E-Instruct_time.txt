A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

2025-04-15 00:13:57,041 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses past data and trends, without expressing a prediction or outlook for future events."
}
```

I chose "not forward looking" because the sentence analyzes historical data and trends, without containing any forward-looking statements or predictions about future economic activity.
2025-04-15 00:13:57,041 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a potential future risk of rising cost pressure, indicating a forward-looking perspective."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "forward looking" because it mentions a potential future risk, indicated by the phrase "contains a risk of rising cost pressure", which suggests that the sentence is discussing a possible future development rather than a current fact.
