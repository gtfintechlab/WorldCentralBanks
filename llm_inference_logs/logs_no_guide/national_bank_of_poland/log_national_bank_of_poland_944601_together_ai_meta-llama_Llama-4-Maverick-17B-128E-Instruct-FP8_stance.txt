A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

2025-04-15 00:20:12,851 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence regarding the National Bank of Poland's monetary policy meeting, let's analyze its content and implications.

The sentence mentions a motion to symmetrically narrow the corridor between the NBP deposit rate and the NBP lombard rate by a total of 50 basis points. The NBP deposit rate is typically the lower bound of the interest rate corridor, and the lombard rate is the upper bound. Narrowing this corridor symmetrically implies that both rates are being adjusted towards the reference rate (usually the main policy rate), but it doesn't directly imply a change in the main policy rate itself.

1. **Understanding the Impact**:
2025-04-15 00:20:12,851 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence according to the National Bank of Poland's monetary policy stance, let's analyze its content and implications.

The sentence discusses a council member's argument that reducing the NBP interest rates could lead to banks increasing margins on newly granted loans due to decreased income from servicing previously granted loans and relatively high interest rates on deposits. This implies a concern about the potential negative effects of lowering interest rates on the banking system's behavior, specifically regarding lending practices.

Given this context, the concern about banks potentially increasing margins on loans due to rate cuts suggests a cautious or negative view towards easing monetary policy (cutting interest rates), which aligns with a h
2025-04-15 00:20:12,851 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence according to the National Bank of Poland's monetary policy stance, let's analyze its content and implications.

The sentence mentions that certain council members believe price growth will be boosted by base effects related to the fading impact of the fall in oil prices in 2020. This implies an expectation of increasing prices (inflation) due to specific economic factors rather than a direct action or stance on monetary policy. However, the acknowledgment of potential inflationary pressures can be associated with a more hawkish stance, as it suggests a concern for inflation that might necessitate a tightening of monetary policy.

Given this analysis, the classification would
