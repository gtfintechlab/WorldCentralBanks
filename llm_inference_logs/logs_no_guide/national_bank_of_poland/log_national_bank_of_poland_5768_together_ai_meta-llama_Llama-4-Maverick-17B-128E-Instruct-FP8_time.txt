A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence provided is: "the council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged at the following levels reference rate at 4.50, lombard rate at 6.00, deposit rate at 3.00 and rediscount rate at 4.75."

1. **Understanding the task**: We need to determine if the sentence is "forward looking" or "not forward looking" based on its content related to the National Bank of Poland's monetary policy meeting.

2. **Analyzing the sentence**: The sentence reports on a decision
2025-04-15 00:11:16,439 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and context.

The sentence discusses the impact of COVID-19 infections and epidemic restrictions on the Polish economy in 2020 Q4, focusing on the services sector. It talks about past events and their effects on economic activity during that period.

Given this, the sentence is describing historical data or past events rather than making any statements about future expectations, predictions, or intentions regarding the National Bank of Poland's monetary policy.

Therefore, the classification should be based on whether the sentence looks forward or discusses past events.

Here's the output following the required structure:

The sentence is: "they drew attention to the fact that price growth was currently significantly elevated and that demand factors were also boosting prices."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence discusses the current state of price growth and the factors influencing it but does not directly imply future actions or expectations regarding monetary policy. However, discussing current price growth and demand factors can be related to understanding the current economic situation, which might be used to infer future policy directions indirectly. Still, the sentence itself is more about the current situation than future expectations or guidance.

2. **Justification**: The sentence
2025-04-15 00:11:55,051 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and implications.

The sentence is: "they drew attention to increase in risk of longer than previously expected period of inflation remaining below the target, as suggested by the revisions of inflation forecasts."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence discusses the risk of inflation remaining below the target for a longer period than previously expected and references revisions of inflation forecasts. This indicates a discussion about future economic conditions and expectations.

2. **Justification**: The sentence is considered "forward looking" because it refers to future expectations regarding inflation in relation to the target and discusses revisions in inflation forecasts, which inherently implies looking ahead
