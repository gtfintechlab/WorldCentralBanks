A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "in line with the central path of the november projection  under the assumption of unchanged interest rates  inflation would return to the nbp inflation target in 2025"

First, we observe that the sentence refers to a future event or condition ("inflation would return to the nbp inflation target in 2025"), which indicates a projection or expectation about the future.

Given this observation, we can classify the sentence as "forward looking" because it discusses a future outcome based on certain assumptions.

Here's the structured output:

The sentence is: "at the same time, it was pointed out that the pace and scale of the recovery were subject to considerable uncertainty."

1. **Understanding the sentence**: The sentence refers to a discussion or meeting where the recovery's pace and scale were discussed, highlighting uncertainty around these aspects.
