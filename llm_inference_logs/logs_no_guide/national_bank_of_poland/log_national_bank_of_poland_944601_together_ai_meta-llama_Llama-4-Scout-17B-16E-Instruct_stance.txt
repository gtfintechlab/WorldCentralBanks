A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses a potential economic scenario without expressing a clear inclination towards tightening or loosening monetary policy."
}
```

The sentence seems to be analyzing a possible relationship between productivity growth, wages, and innovation in Poland, but it does not convey a clear stance on monetary policy, which is why I classified it as "neutral".
2025-04-15 00:17:39,195 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a consideration of potential factors influencing inflation, but does not indicate a clear inclination towards tightening or loosening monetary policy."
}
```

This sentence seems to be discussing potential factors that could influence inflation in Poland, but it doesn't express a clear direction for monetary policy, which is why I classified it as "neutral". The mention of a potential limited impact on inflation doesn't necessarily imply a need for policy action or a change in stance, maintaining a neutral tone.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that the council members expect lower domestic inflation and support lower interest rates, indicating a dovish monetary policy stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence mentions "supported lower domestic inflation", which implies that the council members are inclined towards easing monetary policy, a characteristic of a dovish stance.
2025-04-15 00:17:39,195 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance of the given sentence and provide a concise justification, let's analyze the content:

The sentence mentions that council members observed a slowdown in economic growth and its negative impact on activity in many countries. This observation does not directly advocate for tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) monetary policy but rather notes factors that could influence economic conditions. 

- **Hawkish** refers to a monetary policy stance that is focused on controlling inflation, often through raising interest rates, which is not indicated here.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that the council is concerned about the economic slowdown, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

The sentence implies that the council is concerned about the weakening of external economic activity and its impact on Polish exports, which could lead to a more dovish monetary policy stance, potentially involving looser monetary policy to mitigate the effects of the slowdown.

## Step 1: Understand the context of the sentence
The sentence discusses employment trends in enterprises, noting a slight fall in employment in April but an increase in job offers compared to March.

## 2: Determine the implications for monetary policy
The information about employment and job offers can influence the central bank's (in this case, the National Bank of Poland) decisions regarding monetary policy. Generally, a decline in employment could suggest economic weakness, potentially leading to a dovish stance (supporting economic growth through looser monetary

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that the council members expect a mitigating effect on household consumption growth, implying a potential easing of monetary policy, which is a dovish stance."
}
```

The reasoning behind this classification is that the mention of a mitigating effect on household consumption growth implies that the council members might be inclined to adopt a more accommodative monetary policy stance, which is characteristic of a dovish tone.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that inflation will return to the target, implying no immediate need for policy changes, and frames the outlook as dependent on factors like energy prices, indicating a balanced view."
}
```

This sentence does not indicate a clear intention to tighten (hawkish) or loosen (dovish) monetary policy. Instead, it presents a balanced view, noting that inflation will likely return to the target as the effects of energy price increases fade, without signaling a need for immediate policy action. This makes the stance appear neutral.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that the current inflation rate is lower than expected, which could imply a more accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

The sentence is classified as "dovish" because it highlights a decrease in inflationary pressures, which is a factor that could lead to a more expansionary monetary policy. A dovish stance is typically associated with a focus on economic growth and employment, and a tolerance for higher inflation. 

In this case, the fact that the annual consumer price growth fell and was running below forecasts could suggest that

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides factual information about labor market trends without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply reports data on employment trends without suggesting any implications for interest rates or the overall direction of monetary policy. The information provided does not lean towards a hawkish (tightening) or dovish (loosening) stance, nor does it seem directly relevant to monetary policy decisions, but it also doesn't clearly indicate an irrelevant statement in the context of potential future policy moves based on economic indicators. However
2025-04-15 00:17:42,404 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that factors such as falling commodity prices and easing supply chain disruptions are likely to contribute to lower inflation, which is a dovish signal."
}

This classification is based on the idea that a dovish monetary policy stance is associated with a focus on reducing inflationary pressures and promoting economic growth, often through lower interest rates or other expansionary measures. The sentence's mention of factors that could lead to lower inflation suggests that the National Bank of Poland may be inclined to maintain or adopt a more accommodative monetary policy stance,
2025-04-15 00:17:42,404 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The statement to keep interest rates unchanged and continue to pursue remaining measures indicates a neutral stance, as it implies no change in the current policy and a willingness to continue with existing measures."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence does not indicate a tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) of monetary policy, but rather a decision to maintain the status quo. The mention of continuing to pursue remaining measures suggests a continuation of current policy rather than a shift towards a more aggressive stance.

In this classification, I labeled the sentence as "hawkish" because it implies a concern about the potential risks of easing monetary policy, such as moral hazard, which is a characteristic of a hawkish stance. This suggests that the National Bank of Poland may prioritize inflation control or financial stability over growth, which is in line with a hawkish monetary policy stance

- **Hawkish** refers to a monetary policy stance that is more inclined towards fighting inflation, often through increasing interest rates or reducing money supply, which can have a tightening effect on the economy.
- **Dovish** refers to a stance focused on economic growth and employment, often through lowering interest rates or increasing money supply, which can have a loosening effect on the economy.
- **Neutral** refers to a balanced or middle

The sentence implies that there are no inflationary pressures, which is a dovish signal, as it may lead to a more relaxed monetary policy stance.

  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The mention of a decline in CPI inflation to 2.4% in December 2012 suggests a benign inflation outlook, which is typically associated with a dovish monetary policy stance."
}
```

The reasoning behind this classification is that a decline in inflation often leads to a more accommodative monetary policy stance, as there is less pressure to raise interest rates. A dovish stance is characterized by a preference for lower interest rates or an expansionary monetary policy, which is consistent with the observed decline in inflation.

}
```

In this classification, I labeled the sentence as "hawkish" because it suggests that some council members are concerned about the potential risks of easing monetary policy when inflation is high, which is a hawkish perspective. This perspective typically emphasizes the need to control inflation and maintain a tight monetary policy stance.
2025-04-15 00:17:51,881 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance of the given sentence and provide a concise justification, let's analyze the content:

The sentence discusses weaker wage growth, a decrease in employment, and a lower number of job offers. These indicators suggest economic slowdown or potential recessionary trends. 

- A "hawkish" stance is associated with concerns about inflation and a tendency to raise interest rates to combat it.
- A "dovish" stance is related to concerns about economic growth and employment, suggesting a tendency to lower interest rates or keep them low to stimulate the economy.
- A "neutral" stance implies no clear inclination towards tightening or easing monetary policy

2025-04-15 00:17:56,604 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance of the given sentence and provide a justification, let's analyze it step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the context of monetary policy stances
- "Hawkish" refers to a monetary policy stance that is focused on controlling inflation, often implying higher interest rates.
- "Dovish" refers to a stance that prioritizes economic growth and employment, often implying lower interest rates or an accommodative policy.
- "Neutral" suggests a balanced approach, not clearly favoring tightening or easing.

2025-04-15 00:17:56,604 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies that some council members expect a decline in real interest rates due to expected price growth, which suggests a more accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "dovish" because it suggests that some members of the council are concerned about the potential decrease in real interest rates, which could be interpreted as a signal that they might be willing to maintain or loosen monetary policy to support economic growth, rather than tightening it.
2025-04-15 00:17:56,604 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a pessimistic outlook on economic activity in the euro area, implying a potential need for accommodative monetary policy, which is a dovish stance."
}
```

The sentence mentions a "further strong decline in economic activity" and a risk of GDP fall, indicating a negative economic outlook. This type of language is often associated with a dovish monetary policy stance, which tends to prioritize economic growth and stability over inflation concerns.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that the council members expect a slowdown in GDP growth and curbing effect on price growth, implying a potentially accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the expectation that a slowdown in GDP growth and curbing effect on price growth would lead to a more accommodative monetary policy, which is typically associated with a dovish stance.
2025-04-15 00:17:58,234 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a factual economic data point without expressing a clear stance on future monetary policy actions."
}
```

The sentence simply reports a decline in retail sales without implying any specific direction for interest rates or monetary policy, hence it's classified as "neutral".
2025-04-15 00:17:58,234 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The statement suggests a potentially more optimistic growth outlook, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "dovish" because the mention of a potentially higher GDP growth than previously expected in March could imply that the council members might be inclined to maintain or adopt a more accommodative monetary policy stance, which is characteristic of a dovish stance.
2025-04-15 00:17:58,234 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The statement about the labour market situation being favourable does not explicitly indicate a change in monetary policy stance, nor does it lean towards tightening or loosening policy."
}
```

This sentence is neutral because it simply states a fact about the labour market without implying any specific action or direction for monetary policy. There is no indication of inflation concerns (hawkish) or stimulus (dovish), so it falls under neutral.
2025-04-15 00:17:58,235 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence focuses on the importance of core inflation developments for assessing domestic inflation processes, without expressing a clear inclination towards tightening or loosening monetary policy."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence seems to be a factual observation about the factors that are important for assessing inflation, without expressing a clear bias towards more aggressive monetary policy (hawkish) or more accommodative monetary policy (dovish). The sentence does not provide any clear indication of the council members' stance on interest rates or monetary policy, which is why I did not classify

I chose "neutral" because the sentence is more of a factual observation about the potential impact of a specific event (adjustment of electricity prices) on consumer price growth, rather than a clear expression of a hawkish (concerned about inflation and potentially raising interest rates) or dovish (concerned about growth and potentially lowering interest rates) stance.

{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence signals the possibility of further monetary policy easing, indicating a more accommodative stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence mentions the possibility of further monetary policy easing, which is a characteristic of a dovish monetary policy stance. A dovish stance is associated with a more accommodative monetary policy, where the central bank is more likely to cut interest rates or implement other expansionary measures to stimulate the economy.

This classification is based on the understanding that:

* Dovish: implies a supportive monetary policy stance, often associated with lower interest rates or expansionary policies to stimulate the economy.
* Hawkish: implies a restrictive monetary policy stance, often associated with higher interest rates or contractionary policies to combat inflation.
* Neutral: implies no clear inclination towards tightening or loos

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply reports on economic data (GDP growth) without expressing any views on inflation, interest rates, or other monetary policy issues that would suggest a hawkish, dovish, or clearly policy-relevant tone. The information provided is more about economic performance than about guiding or signaling future monetary policy actions.

I classified the sentence as "neutral" because it simply reports on the state of construction and assembly production without suggesting any implications for interest rates or the overall monetary policy stance. The sentence does not contain any language that would suggest a hawkish (concerned about inflation and potentially raising interest rates) or dovish (concerned about growth and potentially lowering interest rates) tone.

In this case, I classified the sentence as "hawkish" because it implies that the economy might be growing too strongly, which could lead to inflationary pressures and thus might require a tightening of monetary policy, a stance typically associated with "hawkish" central bankers.

```

This classification is based on the description of the major central banks' actions, which include keeping interest rates low, continuing asset purchases, and signalling the maintenance of loose monetary policy in the future. These actions are characteristic of a dovish monetary policy stance, which prioritizes economic growth and accommodative policy over inflation concerns.

In this classification, I considered the following:

* A hawkish stance is associated with concerns about inflation and a tendency to raise interest rates to mitigate it.
* The sentence mentions a decline in unemployment and steady wage growth, which can be seen as indicators of a strong economy that may lead to inflationary pressures.
* There is no mention of concerns about economic growth or easing monetary policy

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that the council members considered the prospect of maintaining negative interest rates in the euro area, which implies a preference for keeping interest rates low, indicating a dovish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the mention of "maintaining negative interest rates in the euro area next year" and the implication that this would support keeping the current level of interest rates, which suggests a dovish (or accommodative) monetary policy stance.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence focuses on the positive aspects of the Polish economy, but does not explicitly mention any monetary policy actions or changes, indicating a neutral stance."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence provides an objective assessment of the Polish economy's fundamentals and does not suggest any inclination towards tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) monetary policy.
2025-04-15 00:18:21,416 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence is neutral as it simply reports on a factual observation about commodity price growth without expressing a clear stance on monetary policy or indicating a need for policy action."
}
```

The sentence does not suggest a tightening or loosening of monetary policy, nor does it indicate a strong concern about inflation or economic growth, which are typical characteristics of hawkish or dovish stances. Instead, it presents a factual observation, which aligns with a neutral monetary policy stance.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that future inflation might be lower than projected, which could imply a more accommodative monetary policy stance, characteristic of a dovish tone."
}
```

This classification is based on the implication that if inflation is expected to be lower than previously projected, the National Bank of Poland might be more inclined to maintain or adopt a looser monetary policy stance to stimulate the economy, which is in line with a dovish monetary policy stance.
2025-04-15 00:18:23,022 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates that the National Bank of Poland plans to raise interest rates to bring inflation down to the target, showing a tightening monetary policy stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that a "hawkish" monetary policy stance is characterized by a focus on controlling inflation, often through interest rate hikes. The sentence explicitly mentions raising interest rates to achieve this goal, which aligns with a hawkish stance.
2025-04-15 00:18:23,022 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The interest rates set by the council suggest a neutral stance as they are not significantly changed from previous rates, with a small adjustment, indicating no major shift in policy direction."
}
```

However, given that we have no information on previous rates and considering typical interpretations:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The low interest rates, especially the deposit rate at 0.00, suggest an accommodative monetary policy stance, which is characteristic of a dovish approach."
}
```

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The statement suggests that the council members expect the inflation effect of rising private sector demand to be mitigated, implying a less accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

This sentence implies a hawkish stance because it suggests that the council members are concerned about inflation and expect that a lower government deficit will help mitigate the inflationary pressures, which is a more cautious approach to monetary policy.

2025-04-15 00:18:24,906 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance of the given sentence and provide a concise justification, let's analyze it step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the context of the sentence
The sentence discusses factors that might influence import growth, including exchange rate appreciation and a strong growth of domestic demand, in the context of the National Bank of Poland's monetary policy meeting.

## 2: Identify key elements that indicate monetary policy stance
- The mention of "exchange rate appreciation" and "strong growth of domestic demand" as factors connected to import growth does not directly imply a tightening or loosening of monetary policy.
- However, the focus on domestic demand

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that interest rate cuts may have negative effects on the economy, such as weakening the exchange rate and negatively affecting inflation, indicating a cautious or restrictive monetary policy stance."
}
```

This sentence indicates a hawkish stance because it highlights potential negative consequences of easing monetary policy (cutting interest rates), which is a characteristic of a hawkish or restrictive monetary policy approach.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The statement implies that the council members are downplaying the need for tight monetary policy, suggesting a more accommodative stance."
}
```

The reasoning behind this classification is that the sentence highlights factors beyond the direct impact of monetary policy (regulated prices) as the cause of higher inflation in Poland, which could suggest that the council members are not considering aggressive monetary policy actions to address inflation, characteristic of a dovish stance.
