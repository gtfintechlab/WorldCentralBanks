A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence provided is: "in this context, it was pointed out that the wage growth in the enterprise sector had been low and the real wage fund had declined."

Let's break down the task:

The sentence is: "while analysing inflation developments, the council members pointed to further decline in cpi inflation which went down to 2.4 in december 2012, i.e"

First, we observe that the sentence is discussing a specific event or data point related to inflation developments during a meeting of the National Bank of Poland's monetary policy council. The key elements here are the "further decline in CPI inflation" and the specific value it reached ("2.4 in December 2012").

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence reports on a past event or
2025-04-15 00:15:36,571 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, "leading to persistently relatively high inflation," we need to analyze its content and the context it implies regarding the National Bank of Poland's monetary policy meeting.

The sentence suggests a projection or expectation about future inflation rates rather than stating a fact. The use of "persistently relatively high inflation" indicates a forecast or a scenario being considered, which is inherently uncertain as it pertains to future economic conditions.

Given this, the classification should reflect the uncertainty associated with predicting future economic outcomes.

Here's the output following the required structure:

2025-04-15 00:15:36,571 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence states: "weakening economic activity is also confirmed by the data on industrial production and leading industrial indicators, which in the recent months were significantly lower than a few months ago."

This sentence is making a statement based on observed data, indicating a clear observation of a trend.

Here's the classification:

{
"label": "certain",
"justification": "The sentence is classified as 'certain' because it states a fact based on observed data without expressing doubt or ambiguity."
}
2025-04-15 00:15:36,571 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and implications.

The sentence is: "along with slow growth in unit labour costs, this contains a risk of rising cost pressure."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence contains the phrase "contains a risk," which indicates a potential future event rather than a statement of fact. This suggests uncertainty.

2. **Justification**: The presence of the word "risk" implies that the outcome (rising cost pressure) is not certain but possible, hence the sentence is classified as uncertain.

3. **Output**:

The sentence discusses the arguments made by some members of the council regarding the lower activity in the United States.

The sentence is: "in line with the central path of the november projection under the assumption of unchanged interest rates inflation would return to the nbp inflation target in 2025"

First, we observe that the sentence is conditional, as indicated by the phrase "under the assumption of unchanged interest rates." This suggests that the outcome (inflation returning to the NBP inflation target in 2025) is dependent on a specific condition being met.

The use of a conditional statement typically introduces uncertainty because it implies that the outcome is not fixed or guaranteed but is instead contingent on certain
2025-04-15 00:15:51,494 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, we need to analyze its content and determine whether it expresses certainty or uncertainty regarding the National Bank of Poland's monetary policy meeting or related economic conditions.

The sentence provided is: "at the same time, it was pointed out that the pace and scale of the recovery were subject to considerable uncertainty."

Let's break down the task:

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence directly mentions that the "pace and scale of the recovery were subject to considerable uncertainty." This indicates a clear expression of uncertainty.

2. **Justification**: The phrase "subject to considerable uncertainty" directly implies that there is uncertainty regarding the pace and scale
2025-04-15 00:15:51,494 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "in this context, rising core inflation indices were highlighted, along with the increasing share of products and services, whose prices were rising at an accelerated pace."

1. The sentence reports on certain economic observations (rising core inflation indices, increasing share of products and services with accelerating price rises) without expressing a clear doubt or ambiguity about these observations.
   
2. However, the context and the implications of these observations are not directly stated, which could imply some level of interpretation.

Despite this, the core information (rising inflation indices and prices) is presented as factual
2025-04-15 00:15:51,494 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and implications.

The sentence is: "while discussing the level of the NBP interest rates, the council judged that they should remain unchanged."

1. **Label Assignment**: The key phrase here is "the council judged that they should remain unchanged." The use of "judged" indicates a decision made based on their assessment or judgment, and "should remain unchanged" clearly states the outcome of that judgment. This decisiveness suggests a level of certainty.

2. **Justification**: The sentence is classified as "certain" because it directly states the council's decision regarding the interest rates without expressing
2025-04-15 00:15:51,494 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and context.

The sentence is: "they emphasized that it was necessary to accept the new reality, namely that in the years to come growth in the western european countries would reach approx"

First, we observe the language used. The phrase "they emphasized" suggests a statement or assertion made by a group or individuals, likely referring to a discussion or decision at the National Bank of Poland's monetary policy meeting.

The key part of the sentence is "that in the years to come growth in the western european countries would reach approx." This part indicates a prediction or forecast about future economic growth.

The sentence is: "while assessing the global economic situation, some members of the council emphasised that the improvement in economic climate in the euro-area economy was relatively small and the forecast economic growth in the region remained considerably below potential."

First, we observe that the sentence reports on the views of "some members of the council," which indicates a subset of the council rather than the council as a whole. This already introduces a level of uncertainty because it doesn't represent a unanimous or possibly even a majority view.

Second, the sentence discusses an assessment and emphasis made by these council members

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Content Analysis**: The sentence discusses the impact of certain factors on the euro area economy. It mentions "further deterioration of the labour market situation" and "unresolved capital shortfall of some euro area banks" as factors that "hampered growth."
