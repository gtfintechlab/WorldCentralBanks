A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

1. **Understanding the Sentence**: The sentence mentions "slow growth in unit labour costs" and its implication on "rising cost pressure." Unit labour costs are a measure of the cost of labour required to produce one unit of output. Slow growth in these costs is generally seen as positive for economic stability, but the sentence indicates that this contains a "risk of rising cost pressure," which could imply inflationary pressures.

Therefore, a positive assessment of the labour market
