A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence mentions a "slight recovery" and a still "weakened" activity in a specific economy (presumably referring to a significant economy related to Poland, likely the euro area given the context), and notes a better economic situation in euro area countries with whom Poland has "less economic ties." This information is somewhat nuanced but leans towards a cautious or less optimistic view regarding the economies closely tied to Poland.

The sentence is: "they assessed that rising unemployment would be conducive to lowering the inflationary pressure through weaker consumer demand and limited wage pressure."

1. **Understanding the Sentence**: The sentence implies that the assessment is focused on the effects of rising unemployment on inflation. It suggests that as unemployment rises, it leads to weaker consumer demand and less pressure on wages, which in turn reduces inflationary pressure.

2. **Monetary Policy Stance Classification**:
   - **Hawkish**: A hawkish stance is typically associated
2025-04-15 00:09:16,017 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence according to the National Bank of Poland's monetary policy stance, let's analyze its content and implications.

The sentence discusses the potential for investment recovery in enterprises due to strengthening private consumption and high export growth. However, it also mentions that corporate investment growth could remain low due to uncertainty surrounding the future economic situation, including the public finance sector.

Given this context, the sentence seems to be cautiously optimistic about economic growth prospects but also highlights significant uncertainties and potential risks. The overall tone does not strongly suggest an immediate need for either tightening or loosening monetary policy; instead, it presents a balanced view of the economic situation.

2025-04-15 00:09:16,017 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence according to the National Bank of Poland's monetary policy stance, let's analyze its content and implications.

The sentence mentions that "in April growth in industrial output had slowed down somewhat, and that in May the PMI index for industry had fallen below the level of 50 points." The PMI index falling below 50 indicates a contraction in the manufacturing sector, as it signifies that more survey respondents are reporting a decrease rather than an increase in activity. This information suggests a weakening economy.

Given this context, the focus on a slowdown in industrial output growth and a decline in the PMI index below 50 points is more likely to
2025-04-15 00:09:16,017 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence according to the National Bank of Poland's monetary policy stance, let's analyze its content.

The sentence discusses the outlook for global economic growth, mentioning strong GDP growth in Asian and Latin American economies, improvement in the United States, and relatively lower GDP growth in European economies. It does not directly mention Poland or the monetary policy decisions of the National Bank of Poland. However, the information provided is related to the global economic outlook, which can influence monetary policy decisions.

Given that the sentence is discussing global economic growth without directly referencing or implying a specific monetary policy action or stance by the National Bank of Poland, we need to assess

The sentence mentions that "prospects for economic activity in the euro area, including Germany, also for 2023 were unfavourable and GDP growth might be close to zero." This statement indicates a concern about the economic outlook, specifically highlighting potential weakness in the euro area, including Germany, which is a significant trading partner for Poland. Such concerns typically suggest a more cautious or accommodative monetary policy stance because weak external demand can negatively impact Poland's economy.

The sentence discusses the potential consequences of abandoning the reduction of fiscal imbalances, highlighting negative outcomes such as increased cost of public debt servicing and the risk of macroeconomic destabilization. It implies a cautious stance towards fiscal policy but does not directly address monetary policy decisions such as interest rates.

However, the context suggests that maintaining fiscal discipline is seen as crucial for macroeconomic stability, which can indirectly support a more cautious or tight monetary policy stance if one interprets the overall economic management as leaning towards caution to avoid destabilization

The sentence is: "it was also observed that such measures were justified by the temporary character of the factors currently boosting inflation, and the persistence of uncertainty about the future economic outlook."

1. **Understanding the sentence**: The sentence implies that certain actions (likely related to monetary policy) are justified due to the temporary nature of the factors driving inflation up and the ongoing uncertainty regarding the future economic outlook.

The sentence mentions that "some council members assessed that the pace of zloty appreciation might have been excessive, arguing that since February 2009 the zloty had strengthened more than other currencies of the region." This indicates a concern about the zloty's appreciation, which could impact export competitiveness and, by extension, economic growth. A strong currency can be detrimental to exports, and thus, the concern here leans towards potentially easing monetary policy or at least not tightening it further to mitigate the zloty's excessive strengthening.

This discussion indicates a focus on understanding the current economic conditions and potential risks rather than making a clear statement about future monetary policy direction.

Since the sentence does not directly imply a tightening ("hawkish"), easing ("dovish"), or a clear neutral stance on monetary policy, we need to infer the stance from the context.
