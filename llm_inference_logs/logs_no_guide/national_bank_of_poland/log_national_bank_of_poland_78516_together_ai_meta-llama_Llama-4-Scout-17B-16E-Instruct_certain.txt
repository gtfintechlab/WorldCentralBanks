A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

2025-04-15 00:13:11,491 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a historical fact about wage growth and real wage fund decline, without expressing any doubt or uncertainty."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it states a fact that has been pointed out in a specific context, without using words or phrases that indicate uncertainty, such as "it is likely that", "it seems that", or "there is a possibility that". The language used is assertive and descriptive of a past situation, which suggests a factual report rather than an uncertain or speculative statement.
2025-04-15 00:13:11,491 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific historical fact about CPI inflation in December 2012, which is a verifiable piece of information."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it states a factual piece of information about a specific economic indicator (CPI inflation) at a specific point in time (December 2012), which can be verified or confirmed. There is no ambiguity or uncertainty expressed in the sentence.
2025-04-15 00:13:11,492 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my response:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains the word 'relatively high inflation', which implies a degree of uncertainty or vagueness about the future inflation rate."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because the phrase "relatively high inflation" suggests a range of possible inflation rates rather than a specific, certain outcome.
2025-04-15 00:13:11,492 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence presents factual information about economic data, using phrases that indicate a clear and objective observation, such as 'confirmed by the data' and 'significantly lower than'."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it reports on specific data and indicators, presenting them as factual and objective evidence of weakening economic activity, without expressing any doubt or uncertainty.

{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a conditional assessment of the NBP interest rates, using phrases like 'should continue to be lowered' and 'should support economic activity', indicating uncertainty about future actions and outcomes."

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it contains words and phrases that convey a sense of possibility or potentiality, rather than certainty. The use of "should" and "assessed" suggests that the outcome is not guaranteed, and that there are different opinions or possibilities being considered.

```
{
  "label": "certain",

}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence provides precise values for various interest rates, implying that the information is factual and certain, rather than speculative or uncertain.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses the economic consequences of deflation as dependent on various factors, implying a level of uncertainty."
}
```

I chose "uncertain" because the sentence implies that the effects of deflation are not fixed or predictable, but rather depend on various factors such as level, sources, and duration, which introduces uncertainty.

{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific statement made by an entity, indicating a clear viewpoint or assessment regarding the effects of exchange rate appreciation."
}
```

Note that I classified the sentence as "certain" because it reports a specific and definitive statement about the potential effects of exchange rate appreciation, without expressing any doubt or ambiguity. The use of phrases like "they pointed out" and "poses a risk" suggests a clear and considered assessment, rather than an uncertain or speculative one.

This classification is based on the presence of phrases such as "high uncertainty" and "about the impact", which suggest that the outcome or future events are not clear or predictable, hence the label "uncertain".

  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports specific facts and data about Poland's consumer price index, indicating a certain state of affairs."

I chose "certain" because the sentence presents information as factual, without expressing doubt or ambiguity, and cites specific data (e.g. "annual consumer price index remained negative"). The presence of "it was stressed" also implies a factual summary of a discussion. 

However, I can also see an argument for "uncertain" if one interprets "signs of a reversal in deflationary trends had appeared" as

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains the word 'would be', indicating a prediction or forecast, which implies uncertainty about future events."
}
```

The sentence expresses a prediction about the future (inflation being curbed by moderate economic growth), which cannot be known with certainty. The use of "would be" suggests a degree of uncertainty, making the sentence uncertain rather than certain.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a potential risk and its consequences, using phrases such as 'highlighted the risk' and 'as a result', which indicate uncertainty."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it discusses a potential risk (elevated capital outflows) and its possible consequences (limited credit supply), rather than stating a fact or a definite outcome. The use of phrases like "highlighted the risk" and "as a result" suggests that the outcome is not guaranteed, but rather a possible scenario.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains conditional language and predictions about future economic trends, indicating uncertainty."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it uses phrases such as "might lead to" and "in the coming quarters", which suggest that the outcome is not guaranteed and is subject to various factors. This language indicates a degree of uncertainty and unpredictability, rather than a statement of fact or certainty.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'however' and 'aimed at mitigating', which indicate a degree of uncertainty or conditionality."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it expresses a conditional or nuanced idea, rather than a straightforward or definitive statement. The use of "however" and "aimed at mitigating" suggests that the outcome is not guaranteed, which introduces uncertainty.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'probably' and 'somewhat' that indicate a degree of uncertainty or vagueness about the state of global economic activity."
}
```

The presence of words like "probably" and "somewhat" suggests that the statement is not entirely definitive, leading to the classification as uncertain.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'might have' and 'in their opinion', which indicate uncertainty and subjectivity."
}
```

The sentence is classified as "uncertain" because it expresses a potential or possible effect ("might have") rather than a definite or known outcome, and also cites the opinion of council members, which introduces subjectivity.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific view expressed by discussants without any ambiguity or expression of doubt."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents a clear statement of fact about the discussants' view, without any hedging or uncertainty. The use of "emphasised" also suggests a strong conviction, which further supports the classification as certain.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports specific, factual data about the labour market, indicating a clear and objective observation."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents concrete, verifiable information about the labour market, such as a fall in unemployment rate, a rise in employment, and an increase in average wages, without any ambiguous or speculative language.
2025-04-15 00:13:50,203 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains phrases such as 'it was assessed that', 'probably only slightly positive', which indicate uncertainty and doubt."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it contains phrases that suggest a degree of doubt or ambiguity, such as "it was assessed that" (which indicates a subjective evaluation) and "probably only slightly positive" (which implies a range of possible outcomes rather than a definitive statement).
