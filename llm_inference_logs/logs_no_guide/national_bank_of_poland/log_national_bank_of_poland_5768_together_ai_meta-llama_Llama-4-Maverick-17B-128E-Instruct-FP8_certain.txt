A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "however, it was underlined that despite a slight recovery, activity in this economy was still weakened, with a better economic situation in those euro area countries with whom poland has less economic ties."

First, we observe the language used. The sentence contains phrases like "it was underlined," which suggests a report or summary of a discussion or meeting, likely the National Bank of Poland's monetary policy meeting. The phrase "despite a slight recovery" indicates a nuanced view of the economic situation, acknowledging both a positive trend (recovery) and its limitations (

The sentence is: "they assessed that rising unemployment would be conducive to lowering the inflationary pressure through weaker consumer demand and limited wage pressure."

First, we observe that the sentence reports on an assessment made by a group, likely referring to the Monetary Policy Council of the National Bank of Poland, given the context.

The key verb here is "assessed," which indicates a judgment or evaluation based on certain conditions or data. The sentence then outlines a causal relationship between rising unemployment and its expected effects on inflationary pressure.

The sentence discusses potential economic developments, specifically the possibility of investment recovery in enterprises due to strengthening private consumption and high export growth. However, it also mentions that corporate investment growth could remain low due to uncertainty surrounding the future economic situation and the public finance sector.

Given this context, the sentence's tone is not definitive or assertive about the future outcome. Instead, it presents a possibility ("could translate into") and a contrasting uncertainty ("could remain low due to the uncertainty"). The presence of phrases like "could translate into" and "could remain low" indicates a level of uncertainty

The sentence is: "attention was drawn, in particular, to the fact that in april growth in industrial output had slowed down somewhat, and that in may the pmi index for industry had fallen below the level of 50 points."

First, we observe that the sentence reports on specific economic data points, such as the growth in industrial output in April and the PMI index for industry in May. These are factual pieces of information.

1. The phrase "growth in industrial output had slowed down somewhat" is a factual report with a slight hedge ("somewhat"), but it still

The sentence discusses the expectations regarding GDP growth in various economies. It mentions that "strong GDP growth could be expected" in certain regions and "relatively lower GDP growth" in others. The use of the phrase "could be expected" indicates a degree of uncertainty or prediction rather than a statement of fact.

Given this analysis, the classification of the sentence is as follows:

The sentence is: "the difference between the collected deposits and granted loans."

Let's break down the task:

1. **Understanding the Sentence**: The sentence refers to a specific financial metric related to banking operations, which is the difference between the deposits collected by a bank (in this case, potentially the National Bank of Poland or banks in general) and the loans granted by it.

The sentence is: "moreover, regarding the structure of gdp growth, it was underlined that in 2017 growth was also driven by strong external demand reflected in a positive contribution of net exports to gdp growth in the second half of 2017."

This sentence reports on a past event or statement made regarding the structure of GDP growth in 2017, specifically highlighting the factors that drove this growth. The language used is factual and descriptive, indicating a statement of fact rather than an expression of uncertainty or speculation about future events or outcomes.

2025-04-15 00:10:52,818 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "most council members pointed out that given the persistence of inflation and the risks related to price growth within the horizon of the strongest monetary policy impact, the reduction in the NBP interest rates should not be significant."

First, we observe that the sentence discusses the views of "most council members," which implies a majority opinion but leaves room for dissent. The key phrase "should not be significant" indicates a recommendation or expectation rather than a definitive statement or decision.

Given these observations, the classification can be determined as follows:

- The language used is not definitive
2025-04-15 00:10:52,818 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, we need to analyze its content and determine whether it expresses certainty or uncertainty regarding the assessment made by the council members.

The sentence is: "other council members assessed that the recent decline in service price growth had probably been temporary."

1. The key to determining the level of certainty lies in understanding the language used. The word "assessed" indicates an evaluation or judgment made by the council members.
2. The crucial term here is "probably," which is an adverb used to express that something is likely but not certain.

Given the presence of "probably," the statement introduces a degree of uncertainty regarding the nature of
