A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses a potential future scenario where faster productivity growth leads to higher wages in Poland, conditional on increased innovation in the Polish economy."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "forward looking" because it describes a hypothetical future situation and a possible causal relationship between productivity growth, innovation, and wages, indicating a prospective outlook.
2025-04-15 00:19:14,814 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses a potential future impact of a downturn abroad on inflation in Poland, indicating a forward-looking perspective."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "forward looking" because it speculates about the potential future effects of a current situation (downturn abroad) on a future outcome (inflation in Poland), which requires a forward-looking perspective.
2025-04-15 00:19:14,814 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence describes the current state of the economy and past assessments, without making predictions or projections about future economic conditions or policy actions."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "not forward looking" because it focuses on describing the current economic situation and the past assessments of the council members, without expressing any views or projections about future economic conditions or policy actions.
2025-04-15 00:19:14,814 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses past economic trends and their impact, rather than making predictions or statements about future economic conditions or policy actions."
}
```

I chose "not forward looking" because the sentence analyzes past events and their effects, using phrases like "after years of expansion" and "negatively affected activity", which indicate a focus on past or current situations rather than future prospects.
