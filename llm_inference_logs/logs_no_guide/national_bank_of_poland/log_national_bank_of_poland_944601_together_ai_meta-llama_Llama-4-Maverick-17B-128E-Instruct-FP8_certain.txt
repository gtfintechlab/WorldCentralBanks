A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "according to these members, faster productivity growth could lead to higher wages in poland provided that it was brought about by more innovation in the polish economy."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence contains the word "could," which is a conditional verb indicating possibility rather than certainty. Additionally, it includes a condition ("provided that") which further suggests that the outcome is not definite. These elements suggest uncertainty.

2. **Justification**: The use of "could" and the conditional clause "provided that" introduces uncertainty, making the outcome dependent on specific conditions

The sentence is: "however, certain council members were of the opinion that the negative impact of the downturn abroad on inflation in poland might be limited when accompanied by increased domestic sales."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence contains phrases that indicate a level of doubt or conditionality regarding the impact of certain economic factors on inflation in Poland. The use of "might be limited" suggests uncertainty about the outcome.

The sentence states: "the majority of council members assessed that despite the observed economic recovery, demand and cost pressures in the polish economy remained low, which, amidst weakened economic conditions and falling inflation pressure abroad, supported lower domestic inflation."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence is reporting on an assessment made by the majority of council members regarding the state of the Polish economy and its implications for domestic inflation. The language used is factual and descriptive, indicating a statement of fact or an assessment based on observed conditions.

The sentence is: "during the discussion, the council pointed out that weakening of external economic activity, in particular in germany, translated into a pronounced deceleration in polish exports growth."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence reports on a statement made by the council during a discussion. It does not express a future prediction or speculation but rather states a fact or an observation made during the meeting.

The sentence is: "they assessed that investment growth could be faster than the central projection path due to more efficient absorption of EU funds than assumed in the projection."

The key elements here are the verb "assessed" and the phrase "could be faster." The verb "assessed" indicates an evaluation or judgment made by the subject. However, "could be faster" introduces a degree of uncertainty or possibility rather than stating a fact or a certainty.

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence is expressing an opinion held by "few council members," which indicates that not all members share this view. This suggests a level of uncertainty or subjectivity in the statement.

2. **Justification**: The phrase "in the opinion of few council members" introduces subjectivity, indicating that the statement reflects a particular viewpoint rather than an objective fact or a universally accepted truth.

The sentence discusses a specific event (the drop in tax revenue in 2009) in relation to a draft amendment of the budget act passed by the lower chamber of the parliament. It mentions that the drop would be "significantly deeper" than the assumed increase in the central budget deficit, based on the information available at the time.

Given this, the classification can be determined as follows:

The sentence discusses some members of the council arguing about certain economic factors constituting risk factors to a permanent recovery of economic growth in the United States. The key elements here are the discussion of "risk factors" and the context of an argument made by "some members of the council," which implies a deliberation or debate.

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence is discussing potential risks to economic growth, which indicates a level of speculation or concern about future outcomes rather than stating a fact or a definitive outcome. The use of the term "risk factors" and the fact that it's

The sentence is: "some discussants emphasised that domestic inflation is to an increasing extent determined by global factors."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence does not assert a fact or a definitive stance but rather reports on the views of "some discussants." This indicates a level of detachment and suggests that the statement is not universally accepted or confirmed.

2. **Justification**: The use of "some discussants emphasised" introduces uncertainty because it implies that not all discussants share the same view, and the statement reflects a particular perspective rather than an established fact.

The sentence discusses a conditional scenario related to the National Bank of Poland's (NBP) monetary policy adjustment based on certain conditions being met, such as the subsidence of uncertainty about the pandemic and its economic impact, continuation of favourable economic conditions, and the risk of inflation running above the NBP's target. The use of conditional language ("should...subside", "if forecasts suggest", "it would be warranted") indicates that the statement is not definitive but rather dependent on future uncertain events or conditions.

Given this analysis, the classification should reflect the conditional nature of the statement
