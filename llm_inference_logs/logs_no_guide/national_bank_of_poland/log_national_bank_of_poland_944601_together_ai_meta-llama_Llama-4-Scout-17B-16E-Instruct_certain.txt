A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence describes motions or proposals to lower interest rates by different amounts (50 and 75 basis points), which implies that the outcome is not yet decided and is therefore uncertain.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains phrases that indicate uncertainty, such as 'although' and 'an uncertainty factor', which suggest that the outcome is not guaranteed."
}
```

The sentence expresses a conditional expectation about inflation returning to the medium-term target, but also mentions an uncertainty factor related to the impact of higher energy prices on inflation expectations, which makes the overall statement uncertain.
2025-04-15 00:18:32,788 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific, factual occurrence (the annual consumer price growth falling in October) and does not express any doubt or ambiguity."
}
```
2025-04-15 00:18:32,788 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports specific data from the LFS, indicating a clear trend or state of affairs without expressing doubt or ambiguity."
}
```

The sentence presents information based on specific data (LFS data) and describes a clear situation regarding the number of working persons in the economy and the private sector, without using words or phrases that suggest uncertainty, such as "likely," "may," "could," or "uncertain." This indicates that the information provided is being presented as factual, hence the classification as "certain."
2025-04-15 00:18:32,789 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes specific, factual events and data that have already occurred, indicating a certain classification."
}
```

I chose "certain" because the sentence reports on past events and data (e.g., "a fall in the prices of some commodities", "the gradual easing of the supply chain disruptions") in a factual manner, without expressing any doubt or uncertainty.
2025-04-15 00:18:32,789 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a clear and definitive opinion of the council members regarding the decision to keep interest rates unchanged."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it uses the phrase "were of the opinion" which indicates a clear and unified view among the council members, and the sentence states a specific action that "should" be taken, implying a degree of confidence and certainty.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence is classified as certain because it uses a definitive tone and lacks words that indicate uncertainty, such as 'may', 'could', or 'likely'."

However, upon re-reading, I realize that the sentence, although written in a predictive manner, assumes a specific outcome ("will be supported", "resulting from") without expressing doubt. But, a case can also be made for it being certain because it does not contain clear uncertainty markers.

A more nuanced view would consider that economic predictions often carry inherent uncertainties.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains phrases such as 'most likely' and 'close to', which indicate a degree of uncertainty rather than a definitive statement."
}
```

This classification is based on the presence of words and phrases that suggest a level of uncertainty or imprecision, rather than a clear and definitive statement. The use of "most likely" and "close to" implies that the outcome is not guaranteed, but rather probable or approximate.
2025-04-15 00:18:34,427 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports specific, factual data about labour market conditions, indicating a certain state of affairs."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents concrete information about labour market conditions, such as "sustained corporate employment growth" and a "declining seasonally adjusted unemployment rate", which are specific, verifiable facts rather than uncertain predictions or opinions.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a possibility rather than a fact, using phrases like 'may be conducive' that indicate uncertainty."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it uses the phrase "may be conducive", which suggests a potential or possible effect rather than a definite or certain one. This implies that the outcome is not guaranteed, and therefore the sentence expresses uncertainty.

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it reports on a specific event or statement made during the meeting without expressing any doubt or ambiguity. The language used suggests a clear and definitive tone, indicating that the sentence is describing a factual occurrence rather than expressing uncertainty or speculation.

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it expresses a prediction or a possibility rather than a certainty, and it also cites the opinions of "some council members" rather than making a definitive statement.

  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words and phrases that indicate uncertainty, such as 'it was assessed', 'would be hampered', and 'might drag on growth', which suggest a degree of doubt or unpredictability."

```

The sentence is classified as "uncertain" because it expresses a assessment or prediction about future economic conditions using words and phrases that indicate a degree of uncertainty, rather than stating a fact or certainty.

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it contains words and phrases that indicate a lack of absolute certainty, such as "expected" and "slightly higher". This suggests that the outcome is not guaranteed and is subject to some degree of uncertainty.

{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific fact about a budget amendment and its implications, without expressing any doubt or ambiguity."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents a factual statement about a specific situation, without using words or phrases that indicate uncertainty, such as "it is likely that", "it seems that", or "there is a possibility that". The language used is assertive and descriptive, suggesting that the information is presented as a fact.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions the possibility of further monetary policy easing, indicating a level of uncertainty about future actions."

The sentence is classified as uncertain because it uses phrases that suggest possibility rather than certainty, such as "could still be seen", which implies that the effects may or may not be present.

Let me know if you'd like me to explain further! 

However, I can also argue that it might be uncertain because it says "had turned out to be higher than expected", implying that there was some expectation or prediction involved, which can be uncertain. 

In that case, I would classify it as:

The sentence expresses a possibility rather than a fact, and the use of words like "likelihood" and "probably" suggests that the outcome is not guaranteed, hence the classification as uncertain.

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it uses a definitive phrase ("should be supported primarily") and does not contain any words or phrases that indicate uncertainty, such as "may", "might", "could", or "it is likely that". The sentence presents a clear and direct statement about the members' opinion, which suggests a high degree of certainty.
