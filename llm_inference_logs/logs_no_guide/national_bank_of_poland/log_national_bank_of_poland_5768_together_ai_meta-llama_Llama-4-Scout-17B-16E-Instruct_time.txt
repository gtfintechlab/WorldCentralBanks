A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses the current state of the economy and does not express a prediction or projection about future economic conditions."
}
```

I chose "not forward looking" because the sentence focuses on the current situation, using phrases like "was still weakened" and "has less economic ties", which indicate a description of the present state rather than a prediction or outlook for the future.
2025-04-15 00:08:34,862 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses a future scenario where rising unemployment would lead to lower inflationary pressure, indicating a projection or prediction about future events."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "forward looking" because it discusses a hypothetical future situation and its expected consequences, using phrases like "would be conducive to" and "through weaker consumer demand and limited wage pressure", which indicate a projection or prediction about future events.
2025-04-15 00:08:34,862 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence contains phrases that explicitly refer to future events or time periods, such as 'in the quarters to come' and 'the future economic situation'."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "forward looking" because it discusses potential future developments and explicitly refers to future time periods, indicating that the statement is looking ahead rather than commenting on current or past events.
2025-04-15 00:08:34,862 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses past events, specifically the slowdown in industrial output growth in April and the decline in the PMI index for industry in May, with no mention of future projections or expectations."
}
```
2025-04-15 00:08:34,862 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses expected future economic growth in various regions, indicating a forward-looking perspective."
}
```

This classification is based on the presence of verbs like "could be expected" and "further improvement", which indicate a focus on future events and expectations, rather than past or current events.
