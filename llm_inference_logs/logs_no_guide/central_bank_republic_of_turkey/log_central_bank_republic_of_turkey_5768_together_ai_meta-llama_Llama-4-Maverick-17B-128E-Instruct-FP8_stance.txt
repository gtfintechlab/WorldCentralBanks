A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

2025-04-14 22:31:20,469 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence according to the Central Bank of Turkey's monetary policy stance, let's analyze the information provided.

The sentence discusses the contributions of various subgroups to annual inflation, highlighting increases across different categories such as services, core goods, energy, food and non-alcoholic beverages, and alcohol, tobacco, and gold. The fact that inflation is rising across these categories, with notable increases, suggests a potential concern for the central bank regarding inflationary pressures.

Given that rising inflation is often a concern for central banks, which may lead to a tightening of monetary policy to curb inflation, the tone of the sentence leans towards indicating a potential

1. **Understanding the sentence**: The sentence mentions that "card spending further increased in the first quarter." This indicates an observation about consumer spending behavior.

2. **Relating to monetary policy**: Monetary policy is concerned with the actions of a central bank to control the money supply and interest rates to promote economic growth, stability, and low inflation. An increase in card spending can be related to economic activity and potentially to inflation if the increase is significant and sustained.
