A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence provided is: "the industrial production of sectors with higher export shares posted a strong growth in this period."

1. **Understanding the Sentence**: The sentence discusses the past performance of industrial production in sectors that have higher export shares. It indicates that there was a strong growth in these sectors during a specified period.

2. **Determining if it's Forward Looking**: A statement is considered "forward looking" if it implies or discusses future events, expectations, or projections. Conversely, a "not forward looking" statement refers to past events, current situations,

The sentence is: "consumption spending fuels the domestic demand, while investments remain relatively sluggish."

1. **Understanding the task**: We need to determine if the sentence is "forward looking" or "not forward looking" in the context of the Central Bank of Turkey's monetary policy meeting.

2. **Analyzing the sentence**: The sentence describes the current state of consumption spending and its effect on domestic demand, as well as the status of investments. It does not explicitly mention any future expectations, predictions, or guidance related to monetary policy.

3. **Classification**:
2025-04-14 22:44:30,627 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and implications.

The sentence is: "in addition, the propensity to save in public expenditures coupled with the rise in unemployment rates hint at a further deceleration in domestic demand."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence implies a prediction or expectation about future economic conditions ("hint at a further deceleration in domestic demand"). This indicates it is discussing something that is anticipated to happen, which aligns with the definition of being "forward looking."

2. **Justification**: The sentence is considered "forward looking" because it suggests a future outcome ("further deceleration in domestic demand") based on current observations ("propensity

The sentence is: "strengthening domestic demand due to the lagged effects of strong credit impulse during the pandemic, affects the current account balance adversely through the imports channel."

1. **Understanding the Sentence**: The sentence discusses the impact of strengthening domestic demand, resulting from past strong credit growth during the pandemic, on the current account balance. It explains a current or past economic situation rather than directly stating future actions or expectations.

2. **Classification**:
    - **Forward Looking**: A sentence is considered forward looking if it implies future actions, expectations, or outcomes that are anticipated or
2025-04-14 22:44:30,627 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and context.

The sentence is: "the relative stability in tourism revenues, the strengthened confidence channel, the favorable effect of the cumulative exchange rate depreciation on net exports, and the normalization of commercial relations with russia will all contribute to growth."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence discusses future contributions to growth based on current or past factors, indicating a projection or expectation about the future.

2. **Justification**: The use of the phrase "will all contribute to growth" indicates a future outlook, suggesting that the sentence is making a prediction or statement about what is expected to happen.
