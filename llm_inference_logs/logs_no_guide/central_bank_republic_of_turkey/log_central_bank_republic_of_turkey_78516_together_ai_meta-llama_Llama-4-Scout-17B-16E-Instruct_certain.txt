A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents a factual statement about the current state of inflation rates, using phrases like "are moderate" that imply a level of confidence and definiteness. There are no words or phrases that suggest uncertainty, such as "may be", "could be", or "it is likely that".

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a specific and verifiable numerical value, indicating a factual statement."

```

This sentence is classified as "certain" because it presents a concrete and measurable piece of information, which can be verified or checked against actual data.
2025-04-14 22:35:32,843 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a predictable and recurring pattern of price hikes due to time-dependent pricing of certain service items."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it describes a regular and expected phenomenon, implying a degree of predictability and regularity, rather than uncertainty or unpredictability.
2025-04-14 22:35:32,843 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific fact about the trend of core goods inflation and its cause, without expressing any doubt or ambiguity."

I chose "certain" because the sentence presents a clear and definitive statement about the trend of core goods inflation and its cause, without using words or phrases that indicate uncertainty, such as "may", "could", "suggests", or "it is likely that".
2025-04-14 22:35:32,843 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'tendencies' and 'recovering', which indicate a sense of possibility or trend rather than a definitive statement, suggesting uncertainty."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it expresses a trend or possibility rather than a definitive fact. The words "tendencies" and "recovering" imply a sense of movement or direction, but do not provide a clear indication of a specific outcome, which is why I consider the sentence uncertain.

  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific observation about the annual inflation and core indicators, stating a clear fact about their trend."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents a factual statement about the inflation and core indicators, without any ambiguity or uncertainty. The use of specific phrases like "recorded a small decrease" and "remained high" suggests a clear and objective observation, which is typical of certain statements.
