A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

2025-04-14 22:40:48,783 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a factual statement about the current state of consumption spending and investments, without expressing any doubt or ambiguity."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents a statement as a fact, using a neutral tone and without any language that suggests uncertainty or doubt.
2025-04-14 22:40:48,783 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'hint at' and 'further deceleration', which indicate a degree of uncertainty and speculation about future events."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it expresses a possibility or a tendency rather than a fact, and the language used suggests that the outcome is not guaranteed.
2025-04-14 22:40:48,783 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a causal relationship using a factual tone, indicating a predictable economic effect."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it describes a cause-and-effect relationship in a matter-of-fact way, without expressing any doubt or uncertainty about the outcome. The language used is objective and assertive, suggesting that the relationship between domestic demand, credit impulse, and the current account balance is a established fact.
2025-04-14 22:40:48,783 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains conditional phrases and factors that may or may not materialize, indicating uncertainty about future outcomes."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it uses phrases such as "will all contribute to growth", implying a prediction about the future, and also mentions factors that are not guaranteed, such as the "normalization of commercial relations with Russia". This suggests that the outcome is not certain.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'suggest' and 'mildly' that indicate a degree of uncertainty or vagueness about the future contribution of the industrial sector to employment."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it expresses a prediction based on indicators and uses words that imply a lack of absolute confidence in the outcome.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a historical fact about price changes in January, using specific data and causal explanations, indicating a certain event."

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence uses the phrase 'on a strong course', which implies a degree of subjectivity and unpredictability, making the statement uncertain."
