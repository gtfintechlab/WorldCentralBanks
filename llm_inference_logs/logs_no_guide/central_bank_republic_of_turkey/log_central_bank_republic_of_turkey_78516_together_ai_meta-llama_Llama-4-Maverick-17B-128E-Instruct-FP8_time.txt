A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "after a decline in february, seasonally adjusted employment remained flat in march."

Let's break it down:

1. The sentence discusses employment figures.
2. It mentions specific months: February and March.

Since the sentence is discussing past events (decline in February and the state of employment in March), it does not directly imply future actions or expectations related to the Central Bank of Turkey's monetary policy.
