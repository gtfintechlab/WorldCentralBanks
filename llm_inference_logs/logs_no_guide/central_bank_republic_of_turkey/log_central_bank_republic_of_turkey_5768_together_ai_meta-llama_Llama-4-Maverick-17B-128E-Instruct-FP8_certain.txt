A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "industrial production recorded a monthly decline of 1.4 percent in january."

First, I observe that the sentence is stating a fact about industrial production. It reports a specific percentage decline in a particular month, which suggests it is conveying information based on data or a report.

The language used is straightforward and does not contain any words or phrases that typically indicate uncertainty, such as "may," "could," "expected to," or "likely." The sentence directly states that industrial production "recorded a monthly decline," which implies a past action that has

The sentence is: "annual inflation in other core goods lost pace but still remained high."

Let's break it down:

1. The sentence is stating a fact about the annual inflation in other core goods.
2. It uses the phrase "lost pace," which indicates a change in the rate of inflation, and "still remained high," which describes the current state of inflation.
3. The language used is factual and descriptive without expressing doubt or uncertainty about the statement.

Given these observations, the sentence is making a statement about a past observation or fact without hedging or expressing uncertainty
2025-04-14 22:32:23,358 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence discusses specific numerical changes in the contributions of various subgroups to annual inflation, providing exact figures for the increases in these contributions across different categories. The information is presented in a factual and objective manner without expressing any doubt or ambiguity about the data or the trends described.

Given the factual nature of the statement and the absence of any language indicating uncertainty or speculation, the sentence should be classified as "certain".

Here's the output following the required structure:

```

The sentence is: "meanwhile, card spending further increased in the first quarter."

Let's break it down:

1. The sentence is stating a fact about card spending.
2. It uses the phrase "further increased," which indicates a clear direction or trend.
3. The statement is made without any conditional language or expressions of doubt.

Given these observations, the sentence is reporting a factual observation without expressing uncertainty.

The sentence is: "the annual inflation and the underlying trend of core indicators recorded a small decrease, yet remained high."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence reports on observed changes in economic indicators (annual inflation and core indicators) without expressing a future prediction or speculation that would typically introduce uncertainty. It states facts about past observations.

2. **Justification**: The sentence is stating a fact about past observations ("recorded a small decrease, yet remained high"), which indicates a certain or factual report rather than speculation or uncertainty.

Given the above analysis, the output should be:

The sentence states: "inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors that affect inflation will be monitored closely and the cautious monetary policy stance will be maintained, by keeping a flat yield curve, until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook."

This sentence implies a commitment to a specific action ("the cautious monetary policy stance will be maintained") based on certain conditions being met in the future ("until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook"). The condition ("until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook") introduces uncertainty because it depends on future events or outcomes that are

The sentence provided is: "in other services, amid reopening, annual inflation increased due to recreational and cultural services as well as maintenance and repair."

Let's break down the task:

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence is stating a fact about the increase in annual inflation in certain service sectors during the reopening. It does not express doubt or uncertainty about the occurrence of the inflation increase.

2. **Justification**: The sentence reports a specific observation

The sentence is: "although investment remains weak, tendencies for investment and employment including that of small and medium-sized firms are recovering."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence contains a mix of a negative statement ("investment remains weak") and a positive statement ("tendencies for investment and employment... are recovering"). The presence of "although" indicates a contrast, and the overall tone suggests a nuanced or mixed assessment rather than an outright positive or negative one. However, the key to determining certainty or uncertainty lies in the language used regarding future or current states.

The sentence provided is: "in sum, domestic demand is likely to provide a modest contribution to growth in the last quarter."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence contains the phrase "is likely to," which is a clear indicator of uncertainty or probability rather than a definitive statement.

2. **Justification**: The use of "is likely to" in the sentence indicates a probability rather than a certainty, suggesting that the outcome is not guaranteed.

Therefore, the classification output should
2025-04-14 22:32:48,729 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence reports specific numerical changes in the contributions of various subgroups to annual inflation, using precise figures and changes (e.g., "rose from 14.62 points to 15.17 points," "dropped from 1.81 points to 1.50 points"). The language used is factual and data-driven, without any expression of doubt, speculation, or ambiguity regarding the information presented.

Given the factual and precise nature of the information, the sentence is conveying information that is presented as fact without any uncertainty.

Therefore, the output should be:
