A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "despite rising commodity and energy prices amid solid growth outlook, consumer and core inflation rates are moderate across the globe."

This sentence makes a statement about the current state of inflation rates globally, despite certain factors that could potentially influence them. The key phrases to focus on are "are moderate across the globe," which indicates a factual or observational statement about the current state of affairs.

The classification task requires determining whether the sentence is "certain" or "uncertain." A sentence is considered "certain" if it states a fact or an assertion with confidence and without
2025-04-14 22:37:59,428 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, we need to analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "therefore, the outlook for 2019 has been revised down for both advanced and emerging economies."

Let's break it down:

1. The word "outlook" refers to a forecast or prediction, which inherently involves some level of uncertainty because it's about future events or conditions.
2. The phrase "has been revised down" indicates a change in the forecast, suggesting that the initial prediction was different, and it has been adjusted.
3. The sentence does not use hedging language or express doubt directly; it states a fact about a revision.

However

The sentence is: "food prices affected services inflation adversely through the catering services channel across the year, leading the restaurants-hotels group to register the highest increase, 13.23 percent, within the sub-groups."

This sentence reports a factual outcome regarding the effect of food prices on services inflation and specifies a particular percentage increase in the restaurants-hotels group. The language used is definitive and does not express doubt or uncertainty about the information being conveyed.

Therefore, the classification should be based on the certainty of the statement.

The sentence is: "the three-month average trend, considered along with the high frequency data for january, implies a rise in exports and a decline in imports."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence is making a statement based on observed data and trends. The use of the word "implies" suggests a conclusion drawn from available information rather than a definitive fact or a speculative statement.

2. **Analysis**: The key word here is "implies," which indicates a deduction or inference based on the data mentioned. The sentence is presenting an interpretation of data rather than stating a fact directly

2025-04-14 22:38:41,090 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "firms’ existing domestic and external orders as well as expectations for future orders reveal that external demand remains strong while domestic demand is expected to increase although it has declined slightly."

First, we observe that the sentence is based on specific data or observations ("firms' existing domestic and external orders") and discusses both current state and future expectations. 

The key phrases to focus on for uncertainty are "expectations for future orders" and "is expected to increase," which indicate a level of forecasting or prediction rather than a statement of fact. However, the sentence
2025-04-14 22:38:41,090 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, I will analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "annual inflation decreased across all groups, being more pronounced in the energy group."

1. The sentence is stating a fact that has already occurred, as indicated by the verb "decreased," which is in the past tense. This suggests a level of certainty because it is reporting on an event that has happened.

2. There are no conditional phrases, speculative language, or expressions of doubt that would introduce uncertainty.

Given these observations, the classification should be "certain" because the sentence reports a factual outcome without any ambiguity or speculation.

Here is the output

The sentence provided is: "the monthly increase in the rents subgroup significantly decelerated compared to january and remained at 2.66%."

Let's break down the task:

1. **Label Assignment**: We need to decide whether the sentence is "certain" or "uncertain".
   
2. **Justification**: We must provide a one-sentence explanation for our choice.

Analyzing the sentence:
- The sentence reports a specific fact about the monthly increase in the rents subgroup
2025-04-14 22:38:49,680 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "recently, weaker global economic activity and heightened downside risks to inflation have strengthened the possibility of advanced economy central banks to take expansionary monetary policy steps."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence discusses a possibility rather than a certainty. It implies that there is a chance or likelihood of advanced economy central banks taking certain actions, rather than stating that they will definitely do so.

2. **Justification**: The use of the phrase "strengthened the possibility" indicates that the action is potential rather than confirmed, introducing uncertainty.

The sentence states: "in august, indicators for global supply chain pressures have remained mild while international transportation costs have increased."

Let's break down the task according to the instructions:

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence reports on specific economic indicators ("indicators for global supply chain pressures have remained mild" and "international transportation costs have increased") without hedging or expressing doubt. This suggests a factual report rather than a speculative or uncertain statement.
