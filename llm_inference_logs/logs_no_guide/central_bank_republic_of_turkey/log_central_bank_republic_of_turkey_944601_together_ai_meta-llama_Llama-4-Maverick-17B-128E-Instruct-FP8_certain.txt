A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "the industrial production of sectors with higher export shares posted a strong growth in this period."

Let's break down the task:

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence is stating a fact or an observation about the industrial production. It does not contain any words or phrases that typically indicate uncertainty, such as "may have," "could be," "possibly," or "it seems."

2. **Justification**: The sentence is phrased as

The sentence is: "consumption spending fuels the domestic demand, while investments remain relatively sluggish."

Let's break it down:

1. The sentence states two facts: 
   - Consumption spending is fueling domestic demand.
   - Investments are relatively sluggish.

2. The language used is assertive and descriptive, indicating a statement of fact or observation rather than speculation or uncertainty.

3. The use of "remain" suggests a continuation of a current state, which is a factual observation.

The sentence is: "in addition, the propensity to save in public expenditures coupled with the rise in unemployment rates hint at a further deceleration in domestic demand."

First, we observe that the sentence discusses economic indicators and their potential impact on domestic demand. The key verb here is "hint," which suggests a degree of inference or indication rather than a definitive statement.

1. **Label Assignment**: The use of "hint" implies that the statement is not making a definitive prediction but rather suggesting a possibility based on observed trends. Therefore, the sentence is not entirely certain about the future deceleration
2025-04-14 22:43:23,289 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "strengthening domestic demand due to the lagged effects of strong credit impulse during the pandemic, affects the current account balance adversely through the imports channel."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence is stating a fact or an economic analysis outcome without expressing doubt or uncertainty about the relationship it describes. It directly links the strengthening domestic demand, due to the lagged effects of a strong credit impulse during the pandemic, to its adverse effect on the current account balance through increased imports. The language used is assertive and does not contain hedging or speculative elements.

2.
2025-04-14 22:43:23,289 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "the relative stability in tourism revenues, the strengthened confidence channel, the favorable effect of the cumulative exchange rate depreciation on net exports, and the normalization of commercial relations with russia will all contribute to growth."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence is making a statement about future events or outcomes ("will all contribute to growth"). The use of "will" indicates a prediction or expectation rather than a fact. However, the tone is assertive and does not express doubt or uncertainty directly.

The sentence is: "similarly, sales of automobiles were down from the fourth-quarter average during the january-february period."

Let's break it down:

1. The sentence reports a factual comparison between the sales of automobiles during the January-February period and the fourth-quarter average.
2. It does not contain any speculative language, modal verbs (like "might," "could," "may"), or conditional statements that typically introduce uncertainty.
3. The tone is informative, stating a historical fact or observation.

Given these observations, the sentence is stating a fact or an observation
2025-04-14 22:43:26,833 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and structure.

The sentence is: "the seasonally adjusted three-month average increases in the b and c indices were measured at 3.4% and 3.6%."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence reports a specific, factual measurement without expressing doubt or ambiguity about the information. It states a clear fact regarding the seasonally adjusted three-month average increases in the b and c indices.

2025-04-14 22:43:26,833 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, we need to analyze its content and tone to determine if it conveys certainty or uncertainty regarding the Central Bank of Turkey's monetary policy meeting. However, upon closer inspection, it becomes apparent that the sentence does not directly relate to the Central Bank of Turkey's monetary policy meeting but rather discusses the industrial production index.

Despite this discrepancy, we can still assess the sentence's certainty based on its language and content. The sentence reports specific percentage changes in the industrial production index, both month-on-month and year-on-year, using precise figures.

Given this, the classification can be determined as follows:

2025-04-14 22:44:04,057 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and the language used.

The sentence is: "in sum, looking forward, net exports are expected to contribute to economic growth and the gradual recovery is likely to continue with the help of the disinflation trend and the partial improvement in financial conditions."

The key phrases to focus on are "are expected to" and "is likely to." These phrases indicate a level of prediction or anticipation rather than a statement of fact. The use of "expected to" and "likely to" suggests that the outcome is not certain but is anticipated based on current trends or conditions.

Therefore, the classification should

The sentence states: "as the limit for the free use of natural gas was exceeded (first 25 cubic metres), the impact of the natural gas item on the monthly consumer inflation rose to 1.01 percentage points, which is consistent with projections."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence reports on a specific event (the limit for free natural gas use being exceeded) and its quantified impact on monthly consumer inflation (1.01 percentage points), indicating a factual or actual outcome. It also mentions that this outcome is "consistent with projections," which implies a comparison between an

The sentence is: "nevertheless, sectoral diffusion of this improvement remained limited and underlying trend of economic activity registered a mild growth."

First, we observe the use of the word "nevertheless," which indicates a contrast or a shift in the discussion, but it does not inherently introduce uncertainty. The phrase "remained limited" provides a clear assessment of the sectoral diffusion of the improvement, indicating a specific condition or state. Similarly, "registered a mild growth" is a factual statement about the underlying trend of economic activity.

The key aspect to consider is whether the language

The sentence is: "in short, economic activity is expected to post a quarterly fall in the third quarter."

Let's break it down:

1. The phrase "is expected to" indicates a prediction or forecast rather than a statement of fact.
