A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

1. **Understanding the Sentence**: The sentence mentions that the industrial production of sectors with higher export shares showed strong growth.

2. **Relating to Monetary Policy**: The growth in industrial production, especially in sectors with higher export shares, can indicate a strong economy. A strong economy might lead to inflationary pressures due to increased demand for labor and resources, potentially prompting a more hawkish stance to curb inflation. However, the sentence itself doesn't directly discuss monetary policy or inflation.

2025-04-14 22:42:21,004 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence according to the Central Bank of Turkey's monetary policy stance, let's analyze it step by step.

1. **Understanding the Sentence**: The sentence states that "consumption spending fuels the domestic demand, while investments remain relatively sluggish." This indicates that the driving force behind domestic demand is consumption rather than investment.

2. **Monetary Policy Stance Classification**:
   - **Hawkish**: A hawkish stance is typically associated with concerns about inflation and a tendency to tighten monetary policy (e.g., raise interest rates) to curb inflationary pressures.
   - **Dovish**: A dovish stance
2025-04-14 22:42:21,004 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence regarding the Central Bank of Turkey's monetary policy stance, let's analyze it step by step.

1. **Understanding the sentence**: The sentence mentions that the propensity to save in public expenditures, along with rising unemployment rates, suggests a further slowdown in domestic demand.

2. **Analyzing the implications**:
   - A decrease in domestic demand can lead to lower inflationary pressures because there's less demand for goods and services.
   - The mention of rising unemployment rates indicates economic slowdown or potential recession, which typically calls for more accommodative monetary policy.
