A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence presents a clear attribution of the production drop to specific factors without expressing any doubt or ambiguity."

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it uses definitive language to explain the reasons for the production drop, without any hedging or uncertainty.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",

```

However, upon re-reading, I think I can make a stronger case:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words and phrases that imply uncertainty, such as 'amid domestic uncertainties' and 'previous MPC meeting period', which suggests that the outcome or future events are not entirely predictable."
}

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a factual observation about the past trend in producer prices, without expressing any doubt or uncertainty."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it describes a specific event (the deceleration of the monthly rate of increase in producer prices) and attributes it to specific causes (declines in refined petroleum product and base metal industry prices, as well as in electricity and natural gas production prices), without using any language that suggests uncertainty or doubt.

2025-04-14 22:29:57,644 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a past event with specific details, indicating a factual statement rather than a speculative or uncertain one."
}
```

I chose "certain" because the sentence describes a specific historical event (price changes in the energy and non-energy commodities groups during the first three weeks of January) without any ambiguous language or expressions of doubt, suggesting that the information is presented as factual rather than speculative.
2025-04-14 22:29:57,644 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports specific, factual changes in non-energy commodity prices over a defined period, without expressing doubt or ambiguity."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it describes specific events (decreases in October and a return to a flat course in November) using factual language, without any hedging or uncertainty.
2025-04-14 22:29:57,644 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports factual changes in economic data without expressing any doubt or ambiguity."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents information about specific changes in economic data (deceleration of monthly change and increase in annual inflation) in a factual and objective tone, without using words or phrases that indicate uncertainty or doubt.
2025-04-14 22:29:57,644 - together_inference - INFO - Response: {
"label": "certain",

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a historical fact about producer prices in May, using a definitive tone and no uncertain language."

```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it states a fact about the past (producer prices recorded a high rate of increase in May) without using uncertain language, such as modal verbs (e.g., "may", "could") or hedging words (e.g., "likely", "suggests").
2025-04-14 22:29:59,258 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words and phrases that indicate uncertainty, such as 'continue to pose downside risks' and 'continue to support', which suggest potential outcomes rather than definite ones."
}
```

The sentence is classified as "uncertain" because it contains words and phrases that indicate potential outcomes or risks, rather than definite or guaranteed ones.

```
{
  "label": "certain",

However, I can also argue that it is uncertain because "broadly in line" is a vague term. Here is an alternative classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence uses a vague phrase 'broadly in line', which implies some degree of uncertainty or flexibility in the assessment."
}
```

In this case, I think the second classification is more accurate

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'weaker', 'heightened downside risks', and 'possibility', which indicate uncertainty and ambiguity."
}
```

The sentence is classified as "uncertain" because it expresses a possibility rather than a definite outcome, and contains words that imply a degree of uncertainty or risk.
2025-04-14 22:30:00,551 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```

  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words and phrases with uncertain or subjective meanings, such as 'lost some momentum', 'picking up again recently', and 'amid reduced geopolitical risks', which indicate a degree of uncertainty."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it contains words and phrases that imply a degree of subjectivity and ambiguity, making the statement less than certain.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'may support' which indicate a possibility rather than a certainty, making the statement uncertain."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it expresses a possibility rather than a definitive outcome, using phrases like "may support". This suggests that the effect of the tax increases on inflation is not guaranteed, but rather a potential influence.
