A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",

}
```

This sentence is classified as "uncertain" because it expresses a prediction or estimation made by the Bank of Russia, rather than a statement of fact. The use of the word "estimates" implies a degree of uncertainty or variability in the expected outcome.
2025-04-14 22:24:40,433 - together_inference - INFO - Response: {

Although the sentence mentions a range for 2023 (5.0-7.0%), which might suggest some uncertainty, the overall tone and the provision of specific numbers for both years imply a level of confidence or certainty about the forecasted inflation rates.

2025-04-14 22:24:43,526 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To accurately classify the given sentence and provide a justification, let's analyze it step by step.

## Step 1: Understanding the Sentence
The sentence provided is: "as a result annual consumer price growth rate will return to 4% in early 2020. are close to neutral." This sentence seems to be incomplete or improperly formatted as it contains two distinct statements: a projection about the annual consumer price growth rate and a statement about something being close to neutral.

## 2: Identifying Key Elements
The key elements for our task are:
1. The projection: "annual consumer price growth rate will return to 4% in early
2025-04-14 22:24:43,526 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific fact about the inflation rate in February-March 2019 relative to the Bank of Russia's expectations, without expressing any doubt or ambiguity."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it states a clear and specific fact about the inflation rate, without using words or phrases that indicate uncertainty, such as "may", "could", "is expected to", or "is likely to". The sentence has a factual tone, suggesting that the information is known and verified.

{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains phrases such as 'in line with the forecast' and 'unstable economic activity', which imply a degree of uncertainty or unpredictability."

I chose "uncertain" because the sentence mentions conditions that may or may not be met (e.g., inflation slowdown being "in line with the forecast"), and also describes economic activity as "unstable", which suggests a lack of confidence in the outcome.

However, I can also make a case that it could be certain as the sentence reports a fact about real wage growth speeding up. In that case, I would revise my response to:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a factual observation about real wage growth speeding up, without any hedging or uncertainty language."

{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence presents a factual description of the effects of the ruble's weakening, without expressing any doubt or ambiguity."

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it states a clear and direct relationship between the weakening of the ruble and its effects on Russian products and economic growth, without using words or phrases that indicate uncertainty, such as "may", "could", "suggests", or "it is likely that".
2025-04-14 22:24:49,768 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific, factual outcome of a decrease in interest rates, indicating a certain event."

```

The sentence describes a specific effect that has occurred, using the past tense and a factual tone, which suggests that the outcome is known and certain.

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it provides concrete and specific projections for inflation rates in different years, using phrases like "will come in at" and "will be close to", which imply a degree of confidence and certainty in the predictions.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a balance between opposing risks, implying a degree of unpredictability and ambiguity."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence mentions a balance between "proinflationary" and "disinflationary" risks, which suggests that the outcome is not predetermined and is subject to various factors, making it uncertain.

  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains phrases like 'within the next months' and 'will assess', indicating a future action that is planned but not guaranteed, hence uncertain."
}
```

This classification is based on the presence of words and phrases that indicate a lack of certainty about future events, such as "within the next months" (which implies a range of possibilities) and "will assess" (which implies a planned action but not a definitive outcome).

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a range of possible values (0.9-1.1%) rather than a single fixed value, indicating uncertainty."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence provides a range of values (0.9-1.1%) for the GDP growth rate, which implies that the outcome is not precisely known and is therefore uncertain.

  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence uses the phrase 'signs have emerged', which indicates a degree of ambiguity and uncertainty about the occurrence of small inflows of funds into fixed-term ruble deposits."

```

Although the sentence is making a prediction about the future, the language used suggests that the speaker is fairly confident in their assertion, which is why I classified it as "certain". However, I can also see why one might argue that it's uncertain, given that it's a prediction about a complex and potentially volatile system. 

An alternative classification could be:

  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific observation about a slowdown in credit activity, using phrases that indicate a clear and evident change, such as 'signs emerged' and 'particularly in the retail segment'."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents a factual observation about a specific economic trend, without expressing doubt or ambiguity. The language used suggests a clear and evident change, rather than a speculative or uncertain one.

2025-04-14 22:25:17,999 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a prediction with specific numbers and a clear timeframe, indicating a level of confidence and certainty in the forecasted inflation rates."
}
```
2025-04-14 22:25:17,999 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a clear and definitive statement about the current state of non-price lending conditions."
}
```

I chose "certain" because the sentence uses specific and assertive language, stating that conditions "are gradually becoming looser" and "are still restrictive", indicating a clear assessment of the situation without expressing doubt or ambiguity.
2025-04-14 22:25:17,999 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'estimated to be about' and 'on the way to', which indicate uncertainty and approximation."
}
```

The sentence is classified as "uncertain" because it uses phrases that suggest a degree of uncertainty or approximation, rather than stating a fact with complete confidence.
2025-04-14 22:25:17,999 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words and phrases that indicate uncertainty, such as 'some uncertainties' and 'persistently high inflation expectations', which suggest a lack of confidence in the outcomes."
}
```
2025-04-14 22:25:17,999 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific, verifiable fact about OFZ yields, implying a clear and definite state of affairs."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it states a factual observation about OFZ yields being "essentially unchanged" since a specific point in time (the end of October), which implies a clear and definite state of affairs that can be verified.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a future prediction that depends on variable factors, such as crop quality and preservation, indicating uncertainty."

This classification is based on the presence of conditional phrases ("will largely depend on") and uncertain factors ("crop quality and preservation"), which suggest that the outcome is not guaranteed, making the sentence uncertain.

{
  "label": "certain",

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents information in a factual and objective tone, without using words or phrases that indicate uncertainty, such as "may", "could", "suggests", or "it is likely that". The sentence simply reports a current state of affairs, which implies a level of confidence or certainty about the information being conveyed.
