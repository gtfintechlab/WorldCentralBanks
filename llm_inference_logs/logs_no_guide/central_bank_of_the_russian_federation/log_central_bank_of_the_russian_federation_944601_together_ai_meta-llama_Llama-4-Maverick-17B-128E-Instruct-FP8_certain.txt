A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "continuing growth of interest rates on household deposits stimulates the propensity to save and increases the attractiveness of deposits."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence is stating a fact or an outcome based on a specific condition (continuing growth of interest rates on household deposits) without expressing doubt or uncertainty about the outcome. It directly links the growth of interest rates to the propensity to save and the attractiveness of deposits.

2. **Justification**: The sentence is phrased in a definitive manner, indicating a clear cause-and-effect relationship without hedging or suggesting
2025-04-14 22:27:09,273 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, we need to analyze its content and tone to determine if it expresses certainty or uncertainty regarding the statement about the Russian economy's deviation from a balanced growth path.

The sentence is: "the russian economy still shows a significant upward deviation from a balanced growth path."

Let's break it down:

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence is stating a fact or an observation about the Russian economy's current state relative to a "balanced growth path." The key words here are "still shows," which indicates an ongoing state, and "significant upward deviation," which is a clear descriptive phrase.

2. **Certainty vs.
2025-04-14 22:27:09,273 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and structure.

The sentence is: "according to bank of russia estimates, as of 27 april, annual consumer price growth rate stood at 16.5%."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence reports a specific fact or figure ("annual consumer price growth rate stood at 16.5%") attributed to a specific source ("bank of russia estimates") and date ("as of 27 april"). The language used is direct and factual, indicating a statement of fact rather than an expression of uncertainty.

1. **Understanding the task**: We need to determine if the sentence is certain or uncertain regarding the Central Bank of the Russian Federation's monetary policy meeting.

2. **Analyzing the sentence**: The sentence discusses the cause of significant inflation acceleration during a specific period (February-May 2014). It attributes this acceleration to "a number of unforeseen factors."

3. **Identifying certainty or uncertainty**: The key phrase here is "unfor
2025-04-14 22:27:09,273 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and implications.

The sentence discusses the Bank of Russia's future assessment of different economic scenarios and factors, indicating a consideration of various possibilities rather than a fixed outcome. This implies that the outcome or the decision is not predetermined and is subject to the assessment of multiple scenarios.

Given this, the classification should reflect the presence of uncertainty.

Here's the output following the required structure:

```json
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates that the Bank of Russia's decision is dependent on the assessment of multiple scenarios, implying uncertainty about the outcome."

This sentence reports on a past event or condition (the effect of fiscal policy on economic activity) and attributes it to a specific cause (the shift in the implementation schedule of national projects). The language used is factual and descriptive without expressing doubt or uncertainty about the occurrence of the event or its cause.

Given this analysis, the classification should be as

The sentence is: "the bank of russia estimates gdp decrease in 2015 q2 compared with the similar quarter last year to be more significant than that in q1 2015."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence is making a statement about an "estimate" made by the Bank of Russia regarding GDP decrease. The use of the word "estimates" indicates a prediction or forecast rather than a fact.

2. **Justification for Label**: The presence of "estimates" suggests that the statement is about a projection or an assessment that is subject to some

The sentence states: "according to the bank of russia forecast, given the monetary policy stance, annual inflation will edge down to 5.0–7.0% in 2023, and return to 4% in 2024. continued to ease, but generally remained tight, including as inflation expectations declined."

First, it is based on a forecast, which inherently involves some level of uncertainty. However, the language used presents the forecast as a statement of future events without hedging or expressing doubt directly about the forecast's accuracy.

The sentence is: "the increase in the key rate is proactive in nature and will help limit the risks of firm inflation anchoring at the level significantly exceeding the bank of russia’s target."

First, we observe that the sentence is discussing a future action ("the increase in the key rate") and its expected outcome ("will help limit the risks"). The use of "will help" indicates a prediction or expectation about the future, rather than a statement of fact.

However, the key to determining the certainty of the statement lies in understanding the nature of the language used. The

The sentence is: "the russian economy reached its pre-pandemic level in 2021 q2."

Let's break it down:

1. The sentence is stating a fact about the Russian economy.
2. It specifies a particular time frame ("in 2021 q2"), indicating a clear and specific point of reference.
3. The language used is declarative and does not contain any hedging words or phrases that typically indicate uncertainty (e.g., "may have," "could be," "possibly").

The sentence is: "this creates the necessity of further increases in the key rate at upcoming meetings."

1. **Understanding the task**: We need to determine if the sentence is certain or uncertain regarding the Central Bank of the Russian Federation's action on the key rate.

2. **Analyzing the sentence**: The sentence implies a future action ("further increases in the key rate") that is conditioned on a current necessity ("this creates the necessity"). The use of "necessity" indicates a strong likelihood or requirement for the action to happen.

3. **Determining certainty**: The phrase
2025-04-14 22:27:39,308 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and structure.

The sentence is: "a more rapid adaptation of the economy, accompanied by an active recovery of imports among other things, may also have a disinflationary effect."

1. **Label Assignment**: The key word here is "may," which is a modal verb often used to express possibility or potentiality rather than certainty.

2. **Justification**: The use of "may" indicates that the statement is speculative or uncertain, as it suggests a possibility rather than a confirmed outcome.

The sentence is: "risks of a global economic slowdown have increased."

Let's break it down:

1. The term "risks" inherently implies uncertainty because it refers to the possibility of an event occurring, not the event itself.
2. The phrase "have increased" indicates a change in the level of these risks, suggesting that the situation is being monitored or assessed.

Given these observations, the sentence is discussing a potential future state (a global economic slowdown) and the heightened possibility of it happening, rather than stating a fact or a certain outcome.

Let's break down the task:

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence discusses a future condition ("food price growth") and its dependency on certain factors ("crop quality and preservation"). The use of "will largely depend" indicates a prediction or expectation rather than a definitive statement.
