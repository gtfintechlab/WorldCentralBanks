A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

Given that the sentence is related to the Central Bank of the Russian Federation's monetary policy meeting, it likely refers to an interest rate decision or a similar monetary policy measure.

The sentence implies a change or a setting of a rate (likely an interest rate) to 7.50% per annum. The fact that it specifies a rate "to" a certain level suggests a future action or a decision that is being implemented or expected to be implemented.

Therefore, the classification is as follows:
