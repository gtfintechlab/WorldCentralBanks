A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

2025-04-14 19:41:41,537 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions elevated inflation expectations and accelerating prices, suggesting a concern for inflation, which is a characteristic of a hawkish monetary policy stance."
}
```

This classification indicates that the sentence is consistent with a hawkish monetary policy stance, which prioritizes controlling inflation over stimulating economic growth. The mention of elevated inflation expectations and accelerating prices suggests that the Central Bank of the Russian Federation may be likely to raise interest rates or take other measures to combat inflation, which is a typical hawkish response.
2025-04-14 19:41:41,537 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions the adopted key rates decisions without implying a future change, indicating a neutral stance."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply states that the demand for imports will adjust to the current situation, including the key rates decisions, without suggesting that the monetary policy will be tightened (hawkish) or loosened (dovish). The tone is informative and descriptive, rather than implying a specific policy direction.
2025-04-14 19:41:41,537 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that low consumer price growth and slowing annual inflation may lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the idea that a dovish stance is associated with a more expansionary monetary policy, which is often signaled by concerns about low inflation or economic growth. The sentence implies that the current low inflation environment may warrant a more supportive monetary policy, which is consistent with a dovish stance.
2025-04-14 19:41:41,537 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions factoring in the impact of investment decisions on the forecast, which is a neutral, data-driven activity that does not explicitly indicate a tightening or loosening of monetary policy."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence seems to focus on the technical aspect of incorporating new information into the forecast, without expressing a clear direction or bias towards more restrictive (hawkish) or more accommodative (dovish) monetary policy.
2025-04-14 19:41:41,537 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual explanation for inflation without expressing a clear stance on future monetary policy actions."
}
```

The sentence simply provides a factual explanation for the current state of food inflation, without indicating a tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) of monetary policy. Therefore, it is classified as neutral.

## Step 1: Understand the Sentence
The sentence provided is: "this is in part related to slower than expected implementation of national projects planned by the government." This sentence seems to refer to factors influencing economic conditions or policy decisions but does not directly state a monetary policy action or stance.

## 2: Identify Key Elements
The key elements here are "slower than expected implementation of national projects." This suggests a potential for economic stimulus or support since national projects often involve government spending, which can be a form of economic
2025-04-14 19:41:43,180 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my response:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a general economic outlook without mentioning any specific monetary policy actions or changes in interest rates, indicating a neutral stance."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence provides a general statement about the Russian economy's growth prospects without implying any specific policy action or bias towards tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) monetary policy.
2025-04-14 19:41:43,180 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions an upward revision of GDP growth forecast, but does not provide information about changes in interest rates or a clear indication of future monetary policy actions, suggesting a neutral stance."
}
```

The sentence does not indicate a tightening or loosening of monetary policy, but rather provides an update on economic forecasts, which suggests a neutral stance. There is no indication of a hawkish (more aggressive) or dovish (more accommodative) stance. Therefore, I classify the sentence as neutral.
2025-04-14 19:41:43,180 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The increase in core inflation to 7.0% in May 2014 suggests a potential upside risk to inflation, which is likely to prompt a hawkish stance from the Central Bank of the Russian Federation."
}
```

This sentence implies that inflation is rising, which is a concern for the Central Bank, and a hawkish stance is typically associated with concerns about inflation and a desire to tighten monetary policy to combat it.
2025-04-14 19:41:43,180 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance of the given sentence and provide a justification, let's analyze it step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the context of the sentence
The sentence discusses factors influencing the economy, specifically mentioning weakening external demand for Russian exports due to a global economic slowdown and weak investment activity dynamics.

## 2: Identify key elements indicating monetary policy stance
- The mention of "weakening external demand" and "weak investment activity dynamics" suggests economic slowdown.
- There is no direct mention of inflation, interest rates, or specific monetary policy actions.

## 3: Interpret the implications of the key elements

2025-04-14 19:41:44,420 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual update on the consumer price growth rate without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance."
}
```

The sentence simply reports on the current state of the consumer price growth rate, without suggesting any tightening or loosening of monetary policy, hence the classification as "neutral".
2025-04-14 19:41:44,420 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The statement that nominal and real interest rates continue to increase suggests a tightening of monetary policy, which is a hawkish stance."
}
```

This classification indicates that the monetary policy stance is hawkish, meaning it is likely to combat inflation by reducing economic growth, as indicated by the increase in interest rates.
2025-04-14 19:41:44,421 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests the possibility of cutting the key rate in Q2-Q3 2019, indicating a loosening of monetary policy, which is a dovish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence implies a potential reduction in the key rate, which is an expansionary monetary policy move, characteristic of a dovish stance.
2025-04-14 19:41:44,421 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The decision to keep the key rate unchanged at 7.25% per annum indicates a neutral stance, as it implies no change in the current monetary policy position."
}

This classification is based on the fact that a decrease in interest rates and yields is often seen as a sign of a more accommodative monetary policy, which is characteristic of a dovish stance.

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence highlights risks associated with high inflation expectations, suggesting a cautious tone that is typically associated with a hawkish monetary policy stance."

```
{
  "label": "neutral",

```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence provides a factual update on inflation without expressing a strong bias towards tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) monetary policy. The mention of inflation drawing near a target (4%) by a specific time (late 2018) suggests a measured approach, which is consistent with a neutral stance.

1. **Understanding the Sentence**: The sentence mentions that the unemployment rate is close to its record lows, while the number of vacancies is at its record highs. This information indicates a very tight labor market, which is often associated with inflationary pressures. When unemployment is low and there are many vacancies, it can signal that the economy is near or at full employment.

2. **Monetary Policy Stance Definitions**:

I classified the sentence as "neutral" because it simply states a fact about the current state of consumer lending and household incomes, without suggesting any tightening or loosening of monetary policy. There is no indication of a hawkish (restrictive) or dovish (expansionary) stance, making "neutral" the most suitable label.

1. **Understanding the Sentence**: The sentence mentions that "price growth becomes more homogeneous in regions and for major groups of goods and services." This implies a stabilization or a uniformization of price growth across different regions and sectors.

2. **Monetary Policy Stance Definitions**:
   - **Hawkish**: Suggests a tightening of monetary policy, often to combat inflation, indicating concerns about inflation rising.
   - **Dovish**: Implies a loosening of monetary policy, suggesting that the economy needs stimulus, often because inflation is low

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence appears to be a factual statement about the Bank of Russia's assumptions and does not convey a clear stance on monetary policy, indicating a neutral tone."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply outlines the parameters and guidelines that the Bank of Russia is using, without expressing a clear opinion or direction on monetary policy. There is no indication of a hawkish (tightening) or dovish (loosening) stance, and the sentence does not seem irrelevant to monetary policy.

  "justification": "The sentence suggests a balanced view, indicating that monetary conditions will remain moderately tight but with a slight easing, implying a neutral stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the following reasoning:

- "Hawkish" typically implies a stance that is more inclined towards tightening monetary policy to control inflation.
- "Dovish" implies a stance that is more inclined towards easing monetary policy to stimulate the economy.
- "Neutral" suggests a balanced or middle-ground approach, neither strongly hawkish nor dovish.
- "Irrelevant" would

The sentence describes a decline in real wage growth, consumer expenditures, and prices of goods and services, which implies a weakening economy. This type of language is often associated with a dovish monetary policy stance, as it suggests that the Central Bank may be more likely to cut interest rates or implement other expansionary policies to stimulate the economy.

  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The decision to keep the key rate unchanged at 16.00% per annum indicates a neutral stance, as it implies no change in the current monetary policy position."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence reports a decision to maintain the status quo, without any indication of a rate hike (which would be hawkish) or a rate cut (which would be dovish). Therefore, the label "neutral" is assigned.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence does not indicate a tightening or loosening of monetary policy, but rather attributes the slowdown in consumer prices to external factors and government decisions."
}
```

The sentence does not suggest that the Central Bank of the Russian Federation is taking a more hawkish (tightening) or dovish (loosening) stance on monetary policy. Instead, it highlights other factors contributing to the slowdown in consumer prices, indicating a neutral tone. Therefore, the label "neutral" is assigned.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates that interest rates have remained unchanged, suggesting a neutral stance with no indication of tightening or loosening monetary policy."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence reports no significant changes in interest rates, which implies that the Central Bank of the Russian Federation is maintaining its current monetary policy stance without any inclination towards tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) it.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that economic activity is performing better than expected, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "dovish" because it implies that the economic outlook is improving, which might lead the Central Bank of Russia to consider easing monetary policy, a dovish stance.
2025-04-14 19:42:01,632 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the sentence "however, some funds were transferred from current accounts to time deposits" in terms of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation's monetary policy meeting stance, we must analyze its implications:

- **Hawkish** refers to a monetary policy stance that is more inclined towards controlling inflation, often through higher interest rates or reducing money supply, indicating a concern for inflation over growth.
- **Dovish** refers to a stance focused on economic growth and employment, often through lower interest rates or increasing money supply, showing a preference for stimulating the economy.
- **Neutral** suggests a balanced approach, neither strongly favoring growth nor

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that the Central Bank of Russia is open to further key rate increases, indicating a tightening bias and a hawkish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence mentions the prospect of further key rate increases, which is a characteristic of a hawkish monetary policy stance. A hawkish stance is associated with a focus on controlling inflation and potentially raising interest rates to achieve this goal.

## Step 1: Understand the Sentence
The sentence mentions that a new exchange rate mechanism will help the Russian economy adjust more rapidly to changing external conditions. This implies a focus on flexibility and resilience in the face of external economic changes.

## 2: Interpret the Implication

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence is neutral as it simply states a fact about the money supply growth rate without implying any specific policy action or tone."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence provides a factual observation about the money supply growth rate without expressing a clear stance on monetary policy, which could be seen as either hawkish (favoring tighter policy) or dovish (favoring looser policy).
2025-04-14 19:42:03,217 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that businesses' price expectations are near multi-year highs, implying potential inflationary pressures and a need for tighter monetary policy, which is a hawkish stance."
}
```

This classification indicates that the sentence has a hawkish tone, as it highlights a potential concern for inflation, which is typically associated with a more restrictive monetary policy stance.

## Step 1: Understand the sentence
The sentence provided is: "investment demand in the private sector is slowing down amid growing government investment." This indicates a specific economic condition rather than a direct statement on monetary policy.

## 2: Determine the implications for monetary policy
- A "hawkish" stance refers to a preference for raising interest rates to combat inflation or to slow down an overheating economy.
- A "dovish" stance refers to a preference for lowering interest rates to stimulate economic growth.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that the economy is facing uncertainty and tough lending conditions, implying a need for accommodative monetary policy, which is a dovish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the implication that the economic uncertainty and tough lending conditions may require a more accommodative monetary policy, which is typically associated with a dovish stance. The sentence does not suggest a need to tighten policy (hawkish) or a neutral view, and it is relevant to monetary policy (not irrelevant).

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a concern about rising inflation, which is a hawkish signal, as it may lead to tighter monetary policy to curb inflationary pressures."
}
```

The reasoning behind this classification is that a hawkish stance is associated with a focus on controlling inflation, and the reported increase in consumer price growth rate and core inflation suggests that the Central Bank may need to take action to mitigate inflationary pressures. 

However, another possible classification could be:

  "justification": "The statement implies a relatively relaxed view on inflation, suggesting that the central bank may not need to take aggressive action to meet its inflation target, which is a dovish stance."
}

The reasoning behind this classification is that the sentence mentions a forecast of inflation being less than 5% in July 2017 and reaching the target of 4% in late 2017, which suggests that the central bank is comfortable with the inflation outlook and is not signaling a need for immediate, drastic action to tighten policy.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that lending was supported by governmental subsidised lending programmes, implying an accommodative monetary policy stance."

I classified the sentence as "dovish" because it implies that the Central Bank of the Russian Federation is implementing or supporting policies that stimulate lending and economic activity, which is a characteristic of a dovish monetary policy stance.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that the Bank of Russia maintains a stable view on certain economic factors, indicating no significant shift in its monetary policy stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence mentions the Bank of Russia leaving its estimates "mostly unchanged", which implies a neutral stance, as there is no indication of a more hawkish (tightening) or dovish (loosening) shift in monetary policy.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",

}
```

This sentence does not suggest that the Central Bank of the Russian Federation is likely to tighten (hawkish) or loosen (dovish) its monetary policy, but rather presents a neutral, factual update on inflation. Therefore, I classify it as "neutral".

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that inflation risks are tilted to the upside, indicating a concern for inflation and a potential need for tighter monetary policy, which is a hawkish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that a "hawkish" monetary policy stance is characterized by a focus on controlling inflation, often implying a willingness to raise interest rates or take other actions to mitigate inflationary pressures. The sentence's emphasis on the upside risk of inflation aligns with this perspective.

{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions a sharp increase in the key rate, which indicates a tightening of monetary policy, a characteristic of a hawkish stance."
}

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that inflationary pressures are expected to decrease, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance."

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates that the Bank of Russia decided to maintain the key rate at 7.5 percent per annum, which implies no change in the monetary policy stance."

I chose "dovish" because the sentence implies that the Central Bank may not need to take strong action to combat inflation, which is a dovish signal. 

Let me know if you agree! 

Alternatively, I can also argue for "neutral" if the context suggests that the sentence is simply a factual observation without any clear policy implication:

This sentence suggests that the Central Bank of the Russian Federation might be concerned about inflationary pressures, which is a characteristic of a hawkish monetary policy stance. The mention of a "significant pro-inflation risk" indicates that the bank may be inclined to take action to mitigate inflation, such as raising interest rates.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual explanation for the temporary acceleration of annual inflation, without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance."

```

The sentence simply reports on the expected increase in inflation due to utility tariffs, without expressing any concern or intention to take action, which suggests a neutral tone.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions a one-off effect on price dynamics without indicating a change in the monetary policy stance, suggesting a neutral tone."
}
```

This sentence does not indicate a tightening or loosening of monetary policy, nor does it express concern about inflation or economic growth, which are typical characteristics of hawkish or dovish stances. The focus on a one-off effect suggests a factual observation rather than a policy directive, leading to a classification as neutral.

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies that price growth rates are accelerating, which may require a tightening of monetary policy to curb inflation, indicating a hawkish stance."

{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions factors contributing to higher inflation rates, but does not express a clear stance on monetary policy or indicate a specific action, making it neutral."

2025-04-14 19:42:28,828 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a negative economic outlook, implying a need for accommodative monetary policy, which is consistent with a dovish stance."
}
```

The sentence mentions a further substantial decrease in output, deterioration of external conditions, and inaccessibility of foreign financial markets, indicating a pessimistic view of the economy. This tone is typically associated with a dovish monetary policy stance, which prioritizes economic growth and stability over inflation concerns.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence presents a factual analysis of the potential impact of economic trends on consumer activity without indicating a direction for interest rates or monetary policy, hence it is neutral."
}
```

This sentence does not advocate for tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) monetary policy but rather discusses the potential effects of certain economic trends, which aligns with a neutral stance. It also does not seem irrelevant to monetary policy discussions, as understanding consumer activity is crucial for central banks.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence is neutral as it only mentions the release of a medium-term forecast following a key rate meeting, without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance."
}
```

This sentence does not provide any information that would suggest a hawkish (more aggressive in raising interest rates) or dovish (more accommodative in lowering interest rates) stance. The release of a forecast is a routine action and does not inherently convey a policy bias. Therefore, the label "neutral" is assigned.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions inflation risks but does not explicitly indicate a tightening or loosening of monetary policy, suggesting a neutral stance."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "neutral" because it simply identifies a risk factor (geopolitical tensions) that may impact inflation, without expressing a clear inclination towards raising or lowering interest rates, or otherwise adjusting the monetary policy stance.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence is a factual observation about inflation dynamics and does not convey a clear stance on monetary policy."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "neutral" because it simply states a fact about inflation dynamics without expressing a clear opinion or direction on monetary policy, which is characteristic of a neutral stance.
2025-04-14 19:42:30,297 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that there are factors that may lead to increased inflation, which is a concern typically associated with a hawkish monetary policy stance."
}
```

This sentence implies that the Central Bank may need to take action to mitigate inflationary pressures, which is consistent with a hawkish stance.
2025-04-14 19:42:30,297 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies that consumer price growth is not being adequately restrained by the economic slowdown, suggesting a need for tighter monetary policy to address inflationary pressures."
}
```

My reasoning is that the sentence highlights the persistence of consumer price growth despite economic slowdown, which is a concern for inflation. This concern is typically associated with a hawkish monetary policy stance, which prioritizes controlling inflation over stimulating economic growth.
2025-04-14 19:42:30,297 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies that inflation expectations are a concern, suggesting a potential tightening of monetary policy, which is a hawkish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the idea that a hawkish monetary policy stance is characterized by a focus on controlling inflation, which is consistent with the concern about inflation expectations hitting multi-year highs.
2025-04-14 19:42:30,297 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies that the Russian economy is underperforming, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

My reasoning is that a lower-than-expected growth rate may prompt the Central Bank of the Russian Federation to consider easing monetary policy, which is a dovish stance.
