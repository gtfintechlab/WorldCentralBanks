A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence mentions that "the ruble’s depreciation caused prices for a wide range of goods and services to accelerate, which was the reason for elevated inflation expectations, along with the July indexation of utility tariffs." This indicates a concern about inflation due to specific economic factors (ruble depreciation and utility tariff indexation).

The sentence is: "demand for imports will be adjusting to the weaker ruble and the adopted key rates decisions in the coming quarters."

1. **Understanding the sentence**: The sentence mentions two key factors influencing demand for imports: a weaker ruble and adopted key rate decisions. A weaker ruble makes imports more expensive, potentially reducing demand for them. The mention of "adopted key rates decisions" refers to the monetary policy decisions made by the Central Bank, which can influence the economy, including import demand.
