A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence contains projections and predictions about future inflation rates in 2023 and 2024, indicating a forward-looking statement."
}
```

This classification is based on the presence of future-oriented language, such as "will edge down to 5.0–7.0% in 2023, and return to 4% in 2024", which suggests that the sentence is making predictions about future events, making it forward looking.
2025-04-14 22:25:29,554 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses the future effect of the key rate increase on inflation, indicating a forward-looking statement."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "forward looking" because it talks about the future consequences of a policy action (the increase in the key rate) on inflation, specifically how it will help limit the risks of firm inflation anchoring at a certain level.
