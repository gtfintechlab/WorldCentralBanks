A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

However, a more accurate analysis would be:

```
{

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence presents a statement as a fact, without any indication of doubt or ambiguity, suggesting that the classification is certain."

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains the phrase 'have not changed materially', which implies a degree of uncertainty or imprecision in the assessment of inflation expectations."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because the phrase "have not changed materially" suggests that there may be some change, but it is not significant enough to be considered a substantial change, implying some degree of uncertainty or ambiguity.

The sentence expresses a prediction about a future event (growing household income and revival of consumer demand in 2018) based on a presumed causal relationship, which implies uncertainty.

{

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a specific historical event with a clear decision made by the Bank of Russia, indicating a certain outcome."
}
```

Although the sentence mentions risks and their potential impact, the main action described (reducing the key rate) is a factual, past event, making the label "certain" appropriate. The phrase "taking into account" introduces a consideration of risks, but it does not introduce uncertainty about the decision that was made.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence uses specific numbers and a clear timeline, indicating a high degree of confidence in the forecast."
}
```

Although the sentence mentions a forecast, which might suggest some uncertainty, the language used is quite specific and assertive, with phrases like "as forecast by the Bank of Russia" and "will be around 4.5%". This suggests that the speaker is presenting a relatively certain prediction based on the bank's projections.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes past events and conditions using definite language, indicating a factual report rather than a speculative or uncertain statement."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it uses specific and definitive language to describe the factors that contributed to the inflation slowdown, without any hedging or uncertainty.

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it uses a statement that implies a future outcome as a fact, without expressing doubt or uncertainty. The use of "will further contain" suggests a predicted outcome that is presented as likely to occur, rather than possible or speculative.

I chose "certain" because the sentence uses a assertive language, stating that the maintenance of moderately tight monetary conditions "will constrain" inflation risks, which implies a high degree of confidence in the outcome.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains phrases such as 'will return' and 'when the effects... peter out', indicating a prediction with some degree of uncertainty."
}
```

The sentence expresses a prediction about a future event (inflation rate returning to 4% in the first half of 2020) and uses phrases that imply some uncertainty about the outcome, which leads to the classification as "uncertain".

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents information in a factual and definitive manner, without using words or phrases that indicate uncertainty, such as "it is likely that," "may," or "could." The use of the phrase "have increased since late 2022" and "remain moderate" suggests a clear and objective assessment of the situation.
