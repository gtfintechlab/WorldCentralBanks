A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

2025-04-14 19:47:03,925 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance and provide a justification, let's analyze the given sentence: "to 7.50% per annum."

## Step 1: Understand the context of the sentence
The sentence appears to refer to an interest rate change or setting by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.

## 2: Determine the implications of the interest rate change
An interest rate of "to 7.50% per annum" suggests a specific level to which the interest rate has been set or changed. Without a clear direction (increase, decrease, or hold), the stance isn't immediately obvious. However, in monetary policy, higher interest
2025-04-14 19:47:03,925 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance of the given sentence, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Understanding the Context**: The sentence discusses real wage growth and its acceleration, attributed to large payments of annual bonuses in the first quarter of 2024.

2. **Identifying Key Elements**: 
   - The mention of "real wage growth has sped up" could imply a positive economic indicator.
   - The acceleration is "associated with large payments of annual bonuses," which suggests a potentially non-sustainable or seasonal factor.

3. **Interpreting Monetary Policy Stance**:
   - **Hawkish**: Implies a concern about inflation or
2025-04-14 19:47:03,925 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a decline in inflation, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance, indicating a dovish tone."
}
```

The reasoning behind this classification is that a decline in inflation often leads to a more dovish monetary policy stance, as it provides room for central banks to cut interest rates or maintain an accommodative policy to support economic growth.
2025-04-14 19:47:03,925 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence highlights several economic challenges, suggesting that the Central Bank of the Russian Federation may adopt a more accommodative monetary policy stance to address these issues."
}
```

The sentence describes a gloomy economic outlook, mentioning sluggish labor productivity growth, contracting fixed capital investment, and low confidence among producers and consumers. This kind of language typically suggests that a central bank might consider easing monetary policy to stimulate the economy, which is consistent with a dovish stance.
2025-04-14 19:47:03,925 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a proactive approach to reducing inflation, indicating a tightening or restrictive monetary policy stance."
}
```

The reasoning behind this classification is that the sentence mentions a specific goal to reduce inflation to 5.0-6.0% in 2022 and return to the target in the middle of 2023, suggesting that the Central Bank of the Russian Federation is taking a proactive and potentially restrictive stance to combat inflation, which is characteristic of a hawkish monetary policy stance.

## Step 1: Understand the Sentence
The sentence mentions that "the anchoring of inflation close to 4% will require both further decrease in inflation expectations and making them less susceptible to price changes." This implies a focus on controlling inflation.

## 2: Identify Key Elements
- The target inflation rate is close to 4%, which suggests a specific goal for inflation.
- The need to decrease inflation expectations and make them less susceptible to price changes indicates a proactive approach to managing inflation.

## 3: Interpret Monetary
2025-04-14 19:47:05,908 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance of the given sentence and provide a justification, let's analyze it step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the context of monetary policy stances
- "Hawkish" refers to a monetary policy stance that is focused on controlling inflation, often implying higher interest rates or a reduction in the money supply.
- "Dovish" refers to a stance that prioritizes economic growth and employment, often implying lower interest rates or an increase in the money supply.
- "Neutral" indicates a balanced approach, neither strongly favoring inflation control nor economic growth stimulation.
- "Irrelevant" suggests the statement does

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual observation about the economy without expressing a clear stance on monetary policy, thus it is neutral."
}
```

This sentence simply describes an economic situation without indicating a direction for monetary policy, hence it's classified as neutral.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that a good harvest will lead to a reduction in food inflation, which could potentially lead to lower interest rates or a more accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "dovish" because it implies that the Central Bank of the Russian Federation may have more room to ease monetary policy due to decreasing inflationary pressures, which is a dovish signal.

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence does not mention interest rates, inflation, or other monetary policy tools, making it irrelevant to the Central Bank of the Russian Federation's monetary policy stance."
}
```

The sentence appears to discuss fiscal policy (budget expenditures) rather than monetary policy, and does not provide any insight into the Central Bank's stance on interest rates or inflation. Therefore, it is classified as "irrelevant".
2025-04-14 19:47:07,558 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance of the given sentence and provide a justification, let's analyze it step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Sentence
The sentence provided is: "this may bring about a more substantial and prolonged upward deviation of inflation from the target." This implies a concern about inflation rising above the target level in a significant and lasting way.

## 2: Interpret the Implication
A concern about inflation deviating upward from the target suggests that the speaker is worried about inflation increasing. In the context of monetary policy, worrying about inflation typically aligns with a desire to tighten policy to prevent or mitigate this inflationary pressure.
2025-04-14 19:47:07,558 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual update on inflation expectations without indicating a change in the monetary policy stance, hence it is neutral."
}
```

The reasoning behind this classification is that the sentence simply reports a data point (inflation expectations edged down but remain elevated) without suggesting that the Central Bank of the Russian Federation will change its policy in a hawkish (more aggressive in fighting inflation) or dovish (more accommodative) direction. Therefore, it does not lean towards hawkish, dovish, or indicate that the information is irrelevant

The reasoning behind this classification is that a hawkish stance is associated with a focus on controlling inflation, which may lead to higher interest rates or other policy actions to slow down the economy. The sentence's mention of increasing inflation rates suggests that the Central Bank may need to take action to mitigate inflationary pressures, which is consistent with a hawkish stance.

  "justification": "The sentence is classified as dovish because the Central Bank of Russia reduced the key interest rate, indicating a loosening of monetary policy to stimulate the economy."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that a reduction in the key interest rate is a dovish move, as it makes borrowing cheaper and can stimulate economic growth. The mention of "persistent risks of considerable economy cooling" also suggests that the bank is concerned about economic growth, which is a dovish concern.

The sentence does not contain clear indications of a hawkish (leaning towards tightening monetary policy) or dovish (leaning towards easing monetary policy) stance. Instead, it emphasizes a careful consideration of various factors to determine the future course of monetary policy, which aligns with a neutral stance.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence describes changes in external conditions without expressing a clear stance on monetary policy, nor implying a specific direction for interest rates or economic growth."

The sentence simply reports on changes in external conditions (fall in oil prices and stricter sanctions) without indicating how these changes would influence the Central Bank of the Russian Federation's monetary policy decisions, hence a neutral classification.

```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply states a fact about the labour market and unemployment without implying any need for policy action or suggesting a specific direction for interest rates. There is no indication of a hawkish (concern about inflation) or dovish (concern about growth or employment) stance.

This classification is based on the understanding that:

* "Hawkish" refers to a monetary policy stance that prioritizes controlling inflation, often through higher interest rates or other restrictive measures.
* The sentence mentions limiting the upward deviation of inflation from the target, which indicates a focus on preventing inflation from rising above the target level, a characteristic of a hawkish stance.

2025-04-14 19:47:17,689 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance of the given sentence and provide a justification, let's analyze it step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the context of the sentence
The sentence discusses a potential source of inflationary pressure related to changes in households' behavior, specifically their propensity to save.

## 2: Identify key elements of the sentence
The key elements here are "inflationary pressure" and "households' propensity to save can become considerably lower." This implies that if households save less, they might spend more, potentially driving up inflation.

## 3: Determine the implications for monetary policy
Inflationary pressure suggests that the economy

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates a downward trend in lending and deposit rates following a cut in the key rate, suggesting an accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that a dovish monetary policy stance is characterized by a tendency to ease monetary policy, often through rate cuts, to stimulate economic growth. The sentence implies that the Central Bank of the Russian Federation has been cutting its key rate, leading to a decrease in lending and deposit rates, which is consistent with a dovish stance.
2025-04-14 19:47:17,689 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The statement suggests maintaining the current key rate with a possibility to cut it in the future, indicating a neutral stance with a slight inclination towards easing, but not strongly dovish."
}
```

However, given that "neutral" often implies no change expected and no clear direction, and considering the context that there is a mention of a possibility to cut rates, a more accurate classification could be:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The statement suggests the current key rate could be cut in 2017

{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The statement mentions that annual inflation continues to decline in line with the Bank of Russia's baseline forecast, indicating no immediate concern for drastic policy changes, which is consistent with a neutral stance."
}
```

This sentence does not indicate a hawkish (concerned with inflation and potentially raising rates) or dovish (concerned with growth and potentially lowering rates) stance, but rather a neutral one, as it simply states that inflation is evolving as expected.

  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests caution and a wait-and-see approach, implying no clear direction on monetary policy, which is characteristic of a neutral stance."
}

## Step 1: Understand the sentence context
The sentence mentions that "the contribution of persistent factors to inflation increased due to faster growth of demand compared to output expansion capacity." This implies that demand is growing faster than the economy's ability to supply goods and services, which can lead to inflationary pressures.

## 2: Interpret the implications for monetary policy
When demand grows faster than supply, it can lead to higher inflation. Central banks, including the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, typically aim to keep inflation within a

The reasoning behind this classification is that the sentence does not suggest any tightening or loosening of monetary policy, but rather presents a baseline scenario for inflation, which implies a neutral stance.

2025-04-14 19:47:30,601 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance of the given sentence and provide a concise justification, let's analyze it step by step.

## Step 1: Understand the Sentence
The sentence provided is: "this is in part related to slower than expected implementation of national projects planned by the government." This sentence seems to refer to factors influencing economic conditions or policy but does not directly state a monetary policy stance.

## 2: Identify Key Elements
The key elements here are "slower than expected implementation of national projects." This suggests a potential for economic stimulus or a mention of economic activity that could influence monetary policy decisions.

## 3: Relate to
2025-04-14 19:47:30,601 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a forecast of decreasing inflation, which suggests a loosening of monetary policy, characteristic of a dovish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence mentions a decrease in inflation to a target of 4% in 2017, which suggests that the Central Bank of the Russian Federation is expecting a reduction in inflationary pressures and potentially preparing for or already implementing a more accommodative monetary policy, which is in line with a dovish stance.
2025-04-14 19:47:30,601 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my response:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a concern about inflation, which typically leads to a hawkish stance, suggesting that the Central Bank may raise interest rates to combat inflation."
}
```
2025-04-14 19:47:30,601 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my response:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence reports on labour market trends without mentioning interest rates or monetary policy actions, indicating a neutral stance."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply states a fact about labour shortages and their causes, without expressing a view that would suggest a tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) of monetary policy. The sentence does not contain information that would suggest a specific direction for monetary policy, hence the classification as "neutral".
2025-04-14 19:47:30,601 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a tightening of monetary policy through a rise in interest rates, indicating a hawkish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that a rise in interest rates is typically associated with a hawkish monetary policy stance, aimed at curbing inflation or reducing economic growth.

2025-04-14 19:47:32,273 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance of the given sentence and provide a concise justification, let's analyze it step by step.

## Step 1: Understand the context of the sentence
The sentence discusses the relationship between labor resources, labor productivity growth, and real wages. It implies that due to limited labor resources, there might be a lag in labor productivity growth compared to an increase in real wages.

## 2: Determine the implications for monetary policy
In the context of monetary policy, statements about labor productivity, wages, and labor resources can have implications for inflation, economic growth, and interest rates. A hawkish stance typically involves concerns about
2025-04-14 19:47:32,273 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a negative economic outlook, implying a need for accommodative monetary policy, which is consistent with a dovish stance."
}
```

The sentence mentions a further substantial decrease in output, deterioration of external conditions, and inaccessibility of foreign financial markets, indicating a pessimistic view of the economy. This type of language is often associated with a dovish monetary policy stance, which tends to prioritize economic growth and stability over inflation concerns.
2025-04-14 19:47:32,273 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that inflation is declining as expected, which may indicate a less urgent need for tightening monetary policy, aligning with a dovish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the idea that a dovish monetary policy stance is associated with a more accommodative or expansionary policy, which is often characterized by a willingness to keep interest rates low or to stimulate the economy. The sentence's tone, which implies that the current inflation trend is in line with expectations and does not require immediate action, is consistent with this stance.
2025-04-14 19:47:32,273 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my response:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that inflationary pressures are rising, which typically prompts a hawkish monetary policy stance to curb inflation."
}
```

In this case, I classified the sentence as "hawkish" because it implies that the Central Bank may need to take action to combat rising inflationary pressures, which is a characteristic of a hawkish monetary policy stance.

{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual assessment of the current state of the economy, without expressing a clear stance on monetary policy."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply reports on the state of the economy, specifically that output in certain sectors has reached or exceeded pre-crisis levels, without indicating a need for tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) monetary policy.
2025-04-14 19:47:33,917 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions potential risks and uncertainties related to external conditions, but does not explicitly indicate a tightening or loosening of monetary policy, hence a neutral stance."
}
```

The sentence discusses potential risks and uncertainties related to external conditions, such as yield growth in advanced economies and geopolitical factors, but does not express a clear direction for monetary policy. Therefore, I classify the sentence as "neutral".

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a subdued growth rate, which could justify a looser monetary policy stance, indicating a dovish tone."
}
```

This classification is based on the idea that a dovish monetary policy stance is typically associated with a focus on economic growth and potentially easing monetary policy to stimulate the economy, which aligns with the concern about a subdued growth rate.

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions significant proinflationary risks, which suggests a concern about inflation and a potential need for tighter monetary policy, a characteristic of a hawkish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence highlights proinflationary risks, which is a concern typically associated with a hawkish monetary policy stance. A hawkish stance is characterized by a focus on controlling inflation, often through higher interest rates or other policy measures that reduce demand and curb price increases.

The reasoning behind this classification is that a "dovish" stance is associated with a more accommodative or lenient monetary policy, which is hinted at by the fact that the decline in business activity is slower than expected, potentially reducing the need for aggressive policy tightening.

This sentence does not indicate a clear direction of monetary policy tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish), but rather presents a conditional forecast, which suggests a neutral stance. The sentence does not provide information that would classify it as irrelevant to monetary policy.
2025-04-14 19:47:40,718 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance of the given sentence and provide a justification, let's analyze it step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Sentence
The sentence provided is: "however, supply-side limitations in the global economy have exacerbated." This sentence mentions supply-side limitations in the global economy getting worse.

## 2: Determine the Implication of Supply-Side Limitations
Supply-side limitations refer to constraints on the production side of an economy, which can lead to inflationary pressures if demand remains strong while supply is unable to keep up. When these limitations exacerbate, it can imply that inflation might rise or that economic growth could be

I chose "neutral" because the statement implies a contained inflation outlook and does not suggest a need for immediate policy action, nor does it signal a significant shift in policy stance. 

Let me know if you want me to adjust anything!

The reasoning behind this classification is that a hawkish monetary policy stance is typically associated with concerns about inflation and a desire to raise interest rates or take other actions to combat it. In this case, the increase in inflation from 8.6% to 9.0% suggests that the Central Bank of the Russian Federation may need to take a more hawkish stance to address inflationary pressures

  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that monetary conditions should remain moderately tight, indicating a bias towards restrictive monetary policy, which is characteristic of a hawkish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the understanding that:

* "Hawkish" refers to a monetary policy stance that prioritizes controlling inflation, often through higher interest rates or tighter monetary conditions.
* "Dovish" refers to a stance that prioritizes economic growth, often through lower interest rates or looser monetary conditions.
* "Neutral" refers to a stance that balances inflation control

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies that the Central Bank of Russia is concerned about high inflation expectations and is taking action to address them by increasing the key rate."

```

My reasoning is that the mention of "high inflation expectations" and the action of "increasing the key rate" suggest a concern about inflation, which is a characteristic of a hawkish monetary policy stance.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence appears to be a factual statement about the Bank of Russia's assumptions and does not convey a clear stance on monetary policy, indicating a neutral tone."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply outlines the parameters and guidelines that the Bank of Russia is using, without expressing a clear opinion or direction on monetary policy. There is no indication of a hawkish (tightening) or dovish (loosening) stance, and the sentence does not seem irrelevant to monetary policy.

```
{

This sentence does not suggest a strong tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) of monetary policy but rather a maintenance of conditions that balance growth and inflation, which aligns with a neutral stance.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides an objective economic outlook without indicating a tightening or loosening of monetary policy, thus it is neutral."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence describes an economic situation and its expected outcome without suggesting any specific action or tone that would indicate a hawkish (concerned about inflation and potentially raising interest rates) or dovish (focused on economic growth and potentially lowering interest rates) stance. The sentence simply presents a factual analysis of the situation, which aligns with a neutral classification.
2025-04-14 19:47:50,359 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates that the Bank of Russia will consider multiple factors in its decision-making, without emphasizing a specific direction for interest rates, suggesting a neutral stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence mentions considering various factors such as inflation dynamics, economic transformation processes, domestic and external conditions, and financial market reactions, without expressing a clear bias towards tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) monetary policy. The tone is cautious and data-dependent, which is consistent with a neutral monetary policy stance.
