A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses past events and their impact on inflation expectations, without referencing future economic projections or policy intentions."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "not forward looking" because it describes historical events (the ruble's depreciation, the July indexation of utility tariffs) and their effects on inflation expectations, without containing any language that looks ahead to future economic conditions or policy decisions.
2025-04-14 19:43:21,718 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence contains future-oriented phrases such as 'in the coming quarters', indicating a projection or prediction about future events."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "forward looking" because it discusses future events or projections, specifically how demand for imports "will be adjusting" in the future.

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence describes the current state of consumer prices and inflation, without making a prediction or referring to future events."
}
```

This sentence is not forward looking because it only discusses the current situation with growth rates of consumer prices and their impact on annual inflation, without projecting these trends into the future or making any predictions.
2025-04-14 19:43:21,718 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence refers to a future forecast and the impact of future decisions, indicating a forward-looking perspective."
}
```

This classification is based on the presence of future-oriented phrases such as "will also factor in" and "forecast", which indicate that the sentence is discussing future events or projections.
2025-04-14 19:43:21,718 - together_inference - INFO - Response: ```
