A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```

This sentence is classified as "forward looking" because it refers to a possible future event or consequence, specifically the potential upward deviation of inflation from the target.
2025-04-14 19:48:47,997 - together_inference - INFO - Response: ```

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses a potential future relationship between labor productivity growth and real wage growth, indicating a forward-looking statement."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "forward looking" because it uses the phrase "may lag more behind", which implies a prediction or projection about a future state, rather than describing a current or past situation.
2025-04-14 19:48:47,997 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my response:
