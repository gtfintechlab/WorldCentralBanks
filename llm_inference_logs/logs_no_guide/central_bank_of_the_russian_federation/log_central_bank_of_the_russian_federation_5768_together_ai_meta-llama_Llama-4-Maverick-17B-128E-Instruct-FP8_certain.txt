A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "the ruble’s depreciation caused prices for a wide range of goods and services to accelerate, which was the reason for elevated inflation expectations, along with the july indexation of utility tariffs."

This sentence is stating a fact or a cause-and-effect relationship that has already occurred. It discusses the ruble's depreciation and its impact on prices and inflation expectations, as well as the effect of the July indexation of utility tariffs. The language used is assertive and describes past events without expressing doubt or uncertainty about them.

The sentence is: "demand for imports will be adjusting to the weaker ruble and the adopted key rates decisions in the coming quarters."

1. **Understanding the task**: We need to determine if the sentence is certain or uncertain regarding the Central Bank of the Russian Federation's monetary policy meeting.

2. **Analyzing the sentence**: The sentence talks about a future event ("will be adjusting") related to the demand for imports. It connects this adjustment to two factors: "the weaker ruble" and "the adopted key rates decisions."

The sentence is: "current growth rates of consumer prices as a whole remain low, contributing to a further slowdown in annual inflation."

Let's break it down:

1. **Statement Analysis**: The sentence makes a statement about the current state of consumer price growth rates and their effect on annual inflation. It uses the phrase "remain low," which indicates an ongoing condition observed or measured.

2. **Certainty vs. Uncertainty**: 
   - The phrase "

The sentence is: "the bank of russia’ forecast will also factor in the impact of the decisions to invest the liquid part of the national wealth fund in excess of the threshold level of 7% of gdp."

First, we need to understand what makes a statement certain or uncertain. A certain statement typically involves a fact, a confirmed action, or a definitive outcome. On the other hand, an uncertain statement involves future predictions, possibilities, or conditions that may or may not happen.

The sentence is: "this partially results from last year’s high base effect of food inflation."

1. **Understanding the Sentence**: The sentence explains a reason or cause for a particular observation or phenomenon, likely related to inflation rates.

2. **Analyzing Certainty**: 
   - The sentence states a fact or an explanation ("this partially results") without expressing doubt.
   - It refers to a specific, past condition ("last year’s high base effect of food inflation"), which is a factual or historical context.

3. **Classification**:

The sentence is: "in february, annual consumer price growth rate rose to 5.2% (vs 5.0% in january 2019)."

Here's my analysis:

- The sentence reports a specific, factual piece of information regarding the annual consumer price growth rate in February.
- It provides a clear comparison with the previous month (January 2019), indicating a factual and historical data point.
- The language used is straightforward and does not contain any speculative or ambiguous terms.

The sentence is: "the bank of russia has lowered its annual inflation forecast for 2019 from 4.0–4.5% to 3.2–3.7%."

Here's my analysis:

* The sentence reports a specific action taken by the Bank of Russia.
* It provides exact figures for the change in the inflation forecast.
* The language used is factual and does not express doubt or ambiguity.

Given these observations, I conclude that the sentence is reporting a fact without any ambiguity or doubt.

The sentence is: "this may bring about a more sustained deviation of inflation from the target."

Let's break it down:

1. **Label Assignment**: The key phrase here is "may bring about," which is a conditional or potential outcome rather than a definitive statement.

2. **Justification**: The use of "may" indicates possibility rather than certainty, suggesting that the outcome is not guaranteed.

Therefore, the classification should reflect the uncertainty expressed by the sentence.
