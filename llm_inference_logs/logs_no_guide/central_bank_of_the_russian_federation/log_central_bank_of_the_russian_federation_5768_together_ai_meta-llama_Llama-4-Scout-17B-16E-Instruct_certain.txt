A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes specific economic events and their consequences without expressing doubt or ambiguity."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents a factual account of the relationship between the ruble's depreciation, inflation expectations, and the indexation of utility tariffs, without using words or phrases that indicate uncertainty, such as "may," "could," "suggests," or "it is likely that."
2025-04-14 19:42:36,982 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'will be adjusting' and 'in the coming quarters', indicating a future prediction and some degree of ambiguity."
}
```

This sentence is classified as uncertain because it expresses a prediction about future events (demand for imports adjusting to the weaker ruble and key rates decisions) and uses phrases that imply a degree of uncertainty or unpredictability.
2025-04-14 19:42:36,982 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence presents a factual statement about current economic trends without expressing doubt or ambiguity."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it uses definitive language, stating that current growth rates of consumer prices "remain low" and are "contributing" to a slowdown in annual inflation, indicating a factual and confident assertion.
2025-04-14 19:42:36,982 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'will also factor in' and 'forecast', which indicate a future prediction or projection, making the statement uncertain."
}
```

This classification is based on the presence of words that suggest a prediction or projection, rather than a statement of fact. The use of "will also factor in" and "forecast" implies a degree of uncertainty and unpredictability, leading to the classification as "uncertain".
2025-04-14 19:42:36,982 - together_inference - INFO - Response: {

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a specific, planned action and its consequences, indicating a level of certainty about the situation."
}
```

I chose "certain" because the sentence mentions a specific plan ("planned reserve fund spending") and a predicted outcome ("the ensuing changeover in the banking sector to a liquidity surplus"), suggesting that the speaker is describing a situation that is expected to occur with a high degree of confidence.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a causal relationship between domestic demand growth, business costs, and inflationary pressures using definitive language, indicating a certain outcome."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it uses phrases such as "does not result", "increases", and "consequently", which imply a direct and inevitable effect, suggesting that the described relationship is viewed as certain or predictable.

  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a predicted outcome as a fact, using a definitive statement about the future contraction of fixed capital investments."

```

However, upon re-reading, I realize that the sentence uses phrases like "will continue to contract" which implies a level of predictability but also consider "high economic uncertainty" which might suggest some level of uncertainty. 

A more accurate classification would be:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports on specific, unchanging forecasts and views, indicating a sense of confidence and definiteness."

I chose "certain" because the sentence presents information as factual and unchanged, without expressing any doubt or ambiguity.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific historical decision made by the Bank of Russia, stating a clear and definitive action that was taken."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "certain" because it describes a specific event that occurred on a particular date, without any ambiguity or indication of doubt. The language used is factual and assertive, indicating a clear decision was made.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a definitive statement about the current state of inflationary pressures, using phrases like 'remain high overall' and 'have not yet demonstrated', which indicate a level of certainty."
}
```

However, I can also argue that:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'overall' and 'have not yet demonstrated', which imply some degree of uncertainty or ambiguity in the assessment of inflationary pressures."
}

Upon reevaluation, I think the second classification makes more sense.

{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'expected' and 'continue to show weak growth', indicating a degree of uncertainty or prediction rather than a statement of fact."

This classification is based on the presence of words that suggest a level of uncertainty or prediction, rather than a definitive statement. The use of "expected" and "continue to show" implies that the outcome is not guaranteed, but rather a forecast or prediction.

{
  "label": "uncertain",

This sentence is classified as uncertain because it expresses a possibility ("may prove to be") rather than a fact, and includes words that imply a degree of unpredictability ("risk").

  "justification": "The sentence expresses a range of possible GDP growth rates (1.5–2.5%) and a future prediction (in 2024–2025), indicating uncertainty."

```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence provides a range of possible values (1.5-2.5%) rather than a single, definitive value, and makes a prediction about the future, which is inherently uncertain.

```

Although the sentence mentions a range for 2023 (5.0-7.0%), which might suggest some uncertainty, the overall tone and the provision of specific numbers for both years justify classifying the sentence as certain. The second part of the sentence seems to describe a consequence of the monetary policy and does not directly relate to the classification of certainty regarding the forecast provided.

This classification is based on the presence of the conditional phrase "if oil prices recover to $70 per barrel by late 2016", which indicates that the predicted GDP growth of 0.7% is dependent on a specific condition being met, introducing uncertainty.
