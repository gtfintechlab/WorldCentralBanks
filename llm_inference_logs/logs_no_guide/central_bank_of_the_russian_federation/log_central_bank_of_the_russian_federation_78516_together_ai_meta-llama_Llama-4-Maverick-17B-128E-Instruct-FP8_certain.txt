A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

2025-04-14 19:50:44,386 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, "to 7.50% per annum," we need to understand its context and content.

Given that the sentence is related to the Central Bank of the Russian Federation's monetary policy meeting, it likely refers to a decision or action taken regarding interest rates.

Here's the classification:

```json
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence states a specific numerical value, indicating a definitive action or decision."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence provides a precise figure ("7.50% per annum"), which typically signifies a concrete decision or outcome, such as
2025-04-14 19:50:44,386 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze it step by step.

The sentence is: "real wage growth has sped up, which is, however, associated with large payments of annual bonuses in 2024 q1."

1. **Understanding the task**: We need to determine if the statement is certain or uncertain regarding the Central Bank of the Russian Federation's monetary policy meeting context.

2. **Analyzing the sentence**:
   - The sentence states a fact about real wage growth speeding up.
   - It attributes this speedup to "large payments of annual bonuses in 2024 q1," indicating a specific reason.

3. **Determining certainty
2025-04-14 19:50:44,386 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and structure.

The sentence is: "in june, annual inflation fell to 15.9% (after 17.1% in may) and, according to estimates as of 15 july, fell to 15.5%."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence reports specific percentages for annual inflation in June and an estimate for a later date (as of 15 July), indicating factual or historical data.

2. **Justification for Label**:
   - The sentence provides concrete figures for inflation rates in May and June and an estimate for the rate as of
2025-04-14 19:50:44,386 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence states: "labour productivity growth is sluggish, while fixed capital investment continues to contract because of declining profits in the real sector, limited access to long-term financing in both international and domestic markets, as well as low producer and consumer confidence."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence is describing specific economic conditions and their causes using factual language. It does not speculate on future outcomes or express doubt about the current state of affairs. Therefore, it should be classified as "certain" because it reports on observed trends and conditions without ambiguity.

2. **Justification
2025-04-14 19:50:44,386 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and structure.

The sentence is: "based on the bank of russia’s forecast, given the monetary policy stance, annual inflation will reduce to 5.0-6.0% in 2022 to return to the target in the middle of 2023."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence is making a prediction about future inflation rates based on a forecast and certain conditions (monetary policy stance). The use of a forecast and a conditional statement ("given the monetary policy stance") introduces some level of uncertainty because forecasts are predictions and the actual outcome can differ. However,

The sentence is: "over the medium term, the balance of inflation risks is still tilted to the upside."

Here's the step-by-step thought process:
1. The sentence discusses the "balance of inflation risks," which is a future-oriented and inherently uncertain topic.
2. It specifies "over the medium term," indicating a future timeframe, which often involves uncertainty.
3. The phrase "is still tilted to the upside" suggests a leaning or inclination rather than a definitive statement, indicating a degree of uncertainty.

The sentence discusses the Bank of Russia's future actions regarding monetary policy based on certain conditions ("if the situation develops in line with the baseline forecast"). The key elements to consider are the conditionality of the actions and the factors influencing the decision.

1. **Conditionality**: The sentence starts with "if," indicating that the actions described are contingent upon a specific condition being met ("the situation develops in line with the baseline forecast"). This conditionality introduces uncertainty because it implies that the outcome or the actions taken depend on how the situation unfolds.

2. **Factors Influencing the Decision

The sentence is: "third, inflationary pressure may stem from changes in households’ behaviour as their propensity to save can become considerably lower."

1. **Label Assignment**: The key phrases to focus on are "may stem" and "can become," which indicate possibility rather than certainty.

2. **Justification**: The use of "may" and "can" in the sentence introduces uncertainty regarding the occurrence of the events described.

2025-04-14 19:50:59,041 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, we need to analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "for the moment, it is premature to judge the pace of future disinflationary trends."

1. The sentence implies a lack of current information or clarity about future events or trends, which is a characteristic of uncertainty.
2. The phrase "it is premature" directly indicates that a judgment or decision is being deferred due to insufficient information or timing, reinforcing the notion of uncertainty.

Therefore, the classification should reflect the uncertain nature of the statement.

The sentence is: "the bank of russia estimates that the ruble weakening will quicken inflation movement to 4% without the risks of overpassing this level, unless the external environment changes considerably."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence contains conditionality and uncertainty regarding future events and their impacts.
   
2. **Justification**: The presence of the word "estimates" and the condition "unless the external environment changes considerably" introduces uncertainty.

Given these observations, the output should be structured as follows:

The sentence discusses the Bank of Russia's baseline scenario, referencing specific parameters and guidelines for fiscal policy and anti-crisis measures. Although it outlines specific references and frameworks the Bank is using, the overall context is about assumptions and projections for future actions and their timing ("announced time frames for the completion of anti-crisis measures"), which inherently involves some level of uncertainty.

However, the key aspect here is that the sentence is describing the basis of the Bank's scenario rather than expressing doubt or ambiguity directly about future outcomes or decisions. It outlines the assumptions and frameworks being used, which

The sentence is: "positive real interest rates will be held at the level which will ensure demand for loans without increasing inflationary pressure and will uphold incentives for saving."

First, we observe that the sentence is discussing a future action ("will be held") regarding monetary policy, specifically the management of real interest rates. The purpose of this action is to achieve certain economic outcomes: ensuring demand for loans, not increasing inflationary pressure, and maintaining incentives for saving.

The key to determining the certainty or uncertainty of the statement lies in its language and the implications of its wording.

The sentence is: "amid persistently restricted access to the international capital markets for russian companies and relatively cheap energy resources, fixed capital investments will continue to edge lower."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence is making a prediction about future economic behavior ("will continue to edge lower"), which inherently involves some level of uncertainty. However, the tone is assertive and predictive rather than speculative.

2. **Justification**: The use of "will continue" indicates a level of certainty or confidence in the prediction being made, despite the future-oriented nature of the statement.

Given these
