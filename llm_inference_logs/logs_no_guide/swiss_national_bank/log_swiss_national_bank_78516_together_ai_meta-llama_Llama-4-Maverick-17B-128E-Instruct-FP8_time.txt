A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "moreover, although the financial industry is well into the process of recovery, another deterioration cannot be entirely ruled out."

1. **Understanding the sentence**: The sentence discusses the current state of the financial industry, mentioning it is in recovery, but also introduces the possibility of future deterioration.

2. **Identifying forward-looking elements**: The phrase "another deterioration cannot be entirely ruled out" implies a consideration of future possibilities or risks.

3. **Classification**:

2025-04-15 01:21:26,237 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and implications.

The sentence is: "however, the inflation forecast shows that the expansionary monetary policy cannot be maintained indefinitely without compromising medium and long-term price stability."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence is discussing the implications of maintaining an expansionary monetary policy on future price stability, referencing an "inflation forecast" and "medium and long-term" effects. This indicates it is discussing future outcomes based on current or potential future actions.

2. **Justification**: The sentence is classified based on its reference to future implications ("cannot be maintained indefinitely", "medium and long-term price stability
2025-04-15 01:21:26,237 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze it step by step.

The sentence is: "the forecast is still associated with considerable uncertainties."

1. **Understanding the sentence**: The sentence talks about a forecast and its associated uncertainties. Forecasts typically relate to future events or conditions.

2. **Determining if it's forward-looking**: A statement is considered forward-looking if it discusses future events, expectations, or projections. The mention of a "forecast" directly implies a discussion about the future.

3. **Classifying the sentence**: Since the sentence refers to a "forecast," it inherently looks towards the future, discussing expectations or predictions about future conditions or events
2025-04-15 01:21:26,237 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze it step by step.

The sentence is: "at the end of the year, gdp and employment were still significantly below precrisis levels in most countries."

1. **Understanding the task**: We need to determine if the sentence is "forward looking" or "not forward looking" in the context of the Swiss National Bank's monetary policy meeting. "Forward looking" typically refers to statements that imply or directly discuss future actions, expectations, or conditions.

2. **Analyzing the sentence**: The sentence discusses the state of GDP and employment "at the end of the year" in relation to "
2025-04-15 01:21:26,237 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and implications.

The sentence is: "uncertainty about the future outlook for the global economy remains exceptionally high and the risks for the global financial system have increased substantially."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence discusses "uncertainty about the future outlook" and "risks for the global financial system," which directly pertains to future conditions or potential future events.

2. **Justification**: The mention of "future outlook" and "risks" indicates that the statement is concerned with what may happen in the future, making it forward-looking.

Therefore, the output should be:
