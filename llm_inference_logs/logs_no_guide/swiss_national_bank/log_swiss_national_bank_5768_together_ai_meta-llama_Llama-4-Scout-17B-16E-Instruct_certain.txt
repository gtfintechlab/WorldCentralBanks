A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```

  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific fact about global growth, using the phrase 'lost momentum somewhat', which indicates a clear observation rather than a speculative or uncertain statement."
}
```
2025-04-15 01:13:21,770 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence presents a statement as a fact, using the phrase 'thus persist' and 'continue to present', indicating a level of certainty about the situation."
}
```
2025-04-15 01:13:21,770 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains the word 'likely', which indicates a degree of uncertainty about the future outcome."
}
```

The sentence is classified as "uncertain" because it expresses a possibility rather than a definitive fact, and the use of "likely" suggests that there is some doubt or unpredictability about whether equipment investment in Switzerland will go up again.
2025-04-15 01:13:21,770 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a specific and objective process for calculating a threshold, indicating a certain and factual statement."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it describes a clear and well-defined procedure for calculating a threshold, without any ambiguous or speculative language. The use of technical terms and specific conditions (e.g. "new incorporation", "change to legal structure", "transformation") also suggests a factual and certain statement.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific and definitive action taken by the Swiss National Bank, indicating a certain outcome."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "certain" because it states a specific action that has been taken (raising the target range for the three-month LIBOR by a further 25 basis points to 1.25-2.25), which implies a level of definiteness and confidence, characteristic of certainty.
2025-04-15 01:13:23,014 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence is a statement of fact about the Swiss National Bank's future action, with no ambiguity or conditional language."
}
```
2025-04-15 01:13:23,014 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains the word 'likely', which indicates a degree of uncertainty about the future GDP growth."
}
```

The word "likely" suggests that the speaker is not entirely sure about the future development of GDP growth, but rather expresses a probability or expectation, which is a characteristic of uncertain statements.
2025-04-15 01:13:23,014 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains the word 'will continue', which implies a prediction about the future, making the statement uncertain."
}
```

This sentence is classified as uncertain because it expresses a prediction or forecast about the future performance of the European economy, which is inherently uncertain and subject to change.
2025-04-15 01:13:23,014 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a clear and specific expectation about future growth, without any indication of doubt or ambiguity."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it uses a definitive phrase ("continues to expect") and provides a specific growth rate ("roughly 1.5"), indicating a clear and confident prediction.
2025-04-15 01:13:24,379 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains conditional language ('if') and future projections ('would rise'), indicating uncertainty about future events."
}
```

This sentence is classified as uncertain because it expresses a hypothetical scenario and a predicted outcome, rather than a statement of fact.
2025-04-15 01:13:24,379 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words and phrases with uncertain meanings, such as 'likely', 'expected', and 'according to the new forecast', which indicate a degree of uncertainty."
}
```

The sentence is classified as uncertain because it contains words and phrases that convey a degree of uncertainty, such as "likely", "expected", and "according to the new forecast". These words suggest that the statements made are predictions or projections rather than statements of fact, and are therefore uncertain.
2025-04-15 01:13:24,379 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a specific and factual representation on a chart, implying a certain statement about the data."
}
```
2025-04-15 01:13:24,379 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a specific and factual situation regarding the effects of certain events on inflation, without expressing any doubt or ambiguity."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents a clear and factual relationship between the appreciation of the Swiss franc, the fall in oil prices, and the impact on inflation, without using uncertain language such as "may", "could", or "likely".

This sentence is classified as uncertain because it uses the phrase "there is a risk that", which implies a possibility or a potential outcome rather than a definite or known fact.

The sentence is classified as uncertain because it expresses a probability ("likely") and a time frame ("over the medium term") that implies a degree of uncertainty and unpredictability about the future effects of the monetary policy easing.

The sentence expresses a prediction or expectation about future economic activity, rather than a statement of fact, which makes it uncertain.

```

Alternatively, I could also argue that the sentence is certain in the sense that it reports a current expectation, but uncertain in the sense that it refers to a future event (growth in 2025). However, given the context of economic forecasting, I think "uncertain" is a reasonable label.

If I had to choose again, I would still go with:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a general economic principle with a clear cause-and-effect relationship, indicating a certain or known effect."

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it describes a well-established economic concept, specifically the lagged effect of changes in money stocks on prices, without expressing any doubt or uncertainty. The use of phrases like "due to the fact" also suggests a deterministic relationship, further supporting the classification as certain.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a risk assessment that may change over time, indicating uncertainty about future economic developments."

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a cause-and-effect relationship using a definitive statement, indicating a predictable outcome."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it uses a definitive statement ("this would have a dampening effect") that implies a predictable outcome, without expressing any doubt or uncertainty.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'assumes' and 'will be', indicating a prediction about the future, which introduces uncertainty."
}
```

The sentence expresses a prediction about the future recovery, which is subject to change and not a fact, hence it is classified as uncertain.

  "justification": "The sentence contains phrases such as 'uncertainty surrounding' and 'on the one hand, and... on the other', which indicate a tone of ambiguity and unpredictability."
}
```

The sentence is classified as "uncertain" because it explicitly mentions uncertainty and describes a situation with multiple, potentially conflicting factors, which suggests a lack of clear outcomes or predictions.
