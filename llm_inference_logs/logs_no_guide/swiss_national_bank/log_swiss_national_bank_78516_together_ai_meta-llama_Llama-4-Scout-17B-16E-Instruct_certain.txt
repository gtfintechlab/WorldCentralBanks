A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it states a clear and definitive consequence of a particular action (maintaining an expansionary monetary policy), using phrases like "cannot be maintained indefinitely" and "compromising medium and long-term price stability", which imply a sense of inevitability and certainty.

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because the language used suggests that the outcome or situation is not entirely clear or predictable, but rather subject to interpretation. 

Alternatively, I could have also used this justification: 
"The sentence uses the phrase 'currently pointing to', which implies that the situation may change or is subject to revision." 

However, I went with the first one.

However, I can also argue that it is uncertain because it involves a subjective judgment about what was expected. In that case:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence involves a subjective interpretation of what was unexpected, implying a degree of uncertainty or variability in perception."
}

Given the context, I think the second classification is more suitable, as "unexpected" is a

However, I can also argue that it is uncertain because it contains the word "period" which may or may not be clearly defined and the recuperation may be subject to change.

  "justification": "The sentence contains phrases such as 'could persist for some time yet', indicating a degree of uncertainty about future events."
}
```

This sentence is classified as uncertain because it expresses a possibility rather than a fact, and the use of "could persist" implies a level of unpredictability.

  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a predicted outcome using a cause-and-effect structure with a tone of inevitability, suggesting a certain outcome."

However, upon re-reading, I realize that the sentence actually describes a future event and uses words like "will prompt" and "will lead", which indicate a level of uncertainty. Here is the revised classification:

```

  "label": "uncertain",

```

  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains the word 'remain', which implies a level of unpredictability, and 'favourable' is a subjective term, indicating that the outcome is not guaranteed."

Alternatively, a more concise justification could be:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The use of 'remain' and 'favourable' implies a degree of uncertainty about future economic signals."
}
```

```

The reasoning is that even though the sentence describes a prediction or expectation from the SNB, the use of "anticipates" and "baseline scenario" suggests that there are conditions or assumptions attached to this prediction, making it uncertain.

  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a potential risk and a conditional outcome, indicated by phrases such as 'there is the risk' and 'once the expectation of rising prices has taken hold', which suggest uncertainty."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "uncertain" because it discusses a potential risk and a conditional outcome, rather than stating a fact or a definitive prediction. The language used, such as "there is the risk" and "once...has taken hold", implies a degree of uncertainty and conditionality.
