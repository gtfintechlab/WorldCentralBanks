A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

2025-04-15 01:24:34,090 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence regarding the Swiss National Bank's monetary policy stance, let's analyze the information provided.

The sentence mentions that "average annual inflation is expected to lie between 0.7 and 1.6 in the next three years." This indicates a forecast of relatively low inflation, as it is below the typical target inflation rate of around 2% that many central banks, including some with similar mandates to the Swiss National Bank, aim for.

Given this context, the expectation of low inflation could suggest a dovish stance because it implies that the bank might need to maintain or adopt accommodative monetary policies to stimulate the economy and push

The sentence is: "essentially, the SNB's conditional inflation forecast is unchanged from its September forecast."

1. **Understanding the sentence**: The sentence indicates that the SNB's forecast for inflation, under certain conditions, has not changed since the last forecast in September. This suggests a continuity in the SNB's assessment of inflationary pressures.
