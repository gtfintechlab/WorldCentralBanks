A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual observation about global growth without implying any specific monetary policy action or bias."
}
```

This sentence simply states a fact about global growth without suggesting that the Swiss National Bank would need to tighten (hawkish) or loosen (dovish) monetary policy, so it seems neutral.
2025-04-15 01:12:29,934 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence highlights persistent imbalances and risks to financial stability, suggesting a cautious tone that is often associated with a hawkish monetary policy stance."
}
```

In this case, I chose "hawkish" because the sentence implies that the Swiss National Bank may be concerned about potential risks to financial stability, which is a tone often used by central banks that are cautious about inflation or financial stability risks and may be inclined to raise interest rates or tighten policy to mitigate those risks.
2025-04-15 01:12:29,934 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides an economic outlook without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance."
}
```

The sentence is simply stating a likely economic development in Switzerland, without suggesting any tightening or loosening of monetary policy, hence a neutral classification.
2025-04-15 01:12:29,935 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence does not convey any information about the Swiss National Bank's monetary policy stance, as it appears to be discussing technical aspects of interest period calculations and exemption thresholds."
}
```

This sentence seems to be more related to technical details of banking regulations rather than the actual monetary policy decisions or stances, hence the label "irrelevant".
2025-04-15 01:12:29,935 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies that the interest rate decision has a dampening effect, suggesting that the Swiss National Bank is taking a restrictive stance, which is characteristic of a hawkish monetary policy."
}

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The mention of liquidity-absorbing measures suggests a tightening of monetary policy, which is a hawkish stance."

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a neutral economic outlook, suggesting a moderate pickup in GDP growth without indicating any drastic changes in monetary policy."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence provides a factual assessment of the economic situation without expressing a clear inclination towards tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) monetary policy. The tone is objective and descriptive, implying that the speaker is simply presenting an economic forecast rather than advocating for a specific policy stance.
2025-04-15 01:12:31,540 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```

The sentence simply states a growth expectation without conveying any specific intention to tighten (hawkish) or loosen (dovish) monetary policy, nor does it seem unrelated to monetary policy (irrelevant). Therefore, it is classified as neutral.
2025-04-15 01:12:32,954 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies that the Swiss National Bank may need to tighten its monetary policy to prevent rising inflation, indicating a hawkish stance."
}
```

This sentence suggests that if monetary policy remains unchanged, inflation rates will increase, which implies that the bank may need to take action to prevent this, indicating a hawkish tone.
2025-04-15 01:12:32,954 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides an objective forecast of economic growth without indicating any intention to tighten or loosen monetary policy, suggesting a neutral stance."

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence is informational and does not convey a clear stance on monetary policy, as it only mentions a technical aspect of the inflation forecast."

2025-04-15 01:12:39,154 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that conditions are met for stimulating employment and private consumption, implying a supportive monetary policy stance."
}
```

This sentence implies that the Swiss National Bank is likely to maintain or implement accommodative policies to boost employment and private consumption, which is a dovish stance.
2025-04-15 01:12:39,154 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The downward adjustment of the inflation forecast suggests a more accommodative monetary policy stance, indicating a dovish tone."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that a downward revision of the inflation forecast typically implies that the central bank may be more likely to maintain or ease its monetary policy stance, which is a characteristic of a dovish tone.
2025-04-15 01:12:39,155 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The mention of inflation being above central banks' targets suggests a concern about inflationary pressures, which is typically associated with a hawkish monetary policy stance."
}
```

This sentence implies that the speaker is aware of the inflationary pressures, which central banks usually try to combat with tighter monetary policy, hence the hawkish classification.
2025-04-15 01:12:39,155 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The slight upward revision in inflation forecast is a minor adjustment, indicating no significant change in the monetary policy stance."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because a slight increase in inflation forecast does not necessarily imply a significant shift in the monetary policy stance, suggesting that the bank's overall policy tone remains unchanged.
2025-04-15 01:12:39,155 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates that the Swiss National Bank has made significant interest rate cuts and will maintain an expansionary monetary course, suggesting a loose monetary policy stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the following reasoning:

* The mention of "significant interest rate cuts" implies a move to stimulate the economy, which is a characteristic of a dovish monetary policy stance.
* The phrase "maintain its expansionary monetary course" further reinforces this interpretation, as it suggests that the central bank is committed to keeping monetary policy loose for the time

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence focuses on the positive economic outlook and its effects on corporate investment and the labour market, without mentioning interest rates or monetary policy actions, indicating a neutral stance."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence provides an optimistic economic forecast without suggesting any changes to monetary policy, which is a characteristic of a neutral stance.
2025-04-15 01:12:42,673 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies that the Swiss National Bank has limited policy options and is resorting to foreign exchange market interventions, indicating a more accommodative or easing stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the idea that the SNB's limited room for maneuver and intervention in the foreign exchange market suggest a more dovish or accommodative monetary policy stance, which is focused on supporting the economy rather than tightening policy.
2025-04-15 01:12:42,673 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a gradual pickup in growth without indicating any immediate changes to monetary policy, implying a neutral stance."
}
```

The sentence provided does not suggest that the Swiss National Bank is likely to tighten (hawkish) or loosen (dovish) its monetary policy. Instead, it presents an outlook on economic growth that is optimistic but does not directly imply a change in the current policy stance, which aligns with a neutral classification.
2025-04-15 01:12:42,673 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses uncertainty about the impact of the US budget consolidation on growth, but does not convey a clear stance on monetary policy."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence is more of a statement of uncertainty rather than a clear indication of a hawkish (favoring tighter monetary policy) or dovish (favoring looser monetary policy) stance. The sentence does not provide any information that would suggest a specific direction for monetary policy, hence the classification as "neutral".
2025-04-15 01:12:42,673 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies that the Swiss National Bank has recently eased monetary policy by lowering interest rates, indicating a dovish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that a rate cut is a expansionary monetary policy move, which is typically associated with a dovish stance.

This sentence simply reports on the state of global economic growth without expressing a view that would lean towards tightening (hawkish) or easing (dovish) monetary policy, nor does it seem unrelated to monetary policy discussions (irrelevant). Therefore, it is classified as neutral.
2025-04-15 01:12:46,439 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance of the given sentence and provide a justification, let's analyze it step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Sentence
The sentence provided is: "risk premia are now minimal; indeed, on occasion they have fallen even further." This statement seems to indicate a positive or accommodative condition regarding risk premia.

## 2: Interpret the Meaning of Risk Premia in Monetary Policy
In the context of monetary policy, risk premia refer to the extra return that investors demand for taking on risk. When risk premia are low or have decreased, it can indicate that investors are less risk-averse

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a conditional forecast without expressing a clear intention to change or maintain the current monetary policy stance."
}
```

The sentence seems to be providing a conditional forecast rather than expressing a clear policy intention, which is why I classified it as "neutral". If the sentence were to imply a desire to change the libor rate or explicitly state that it would be kept at 0.75%, it would be easier to classify as hawkish, dovish, or more clearly neutral. As it stands, it simply presents a scenario without taking

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a general positive outlook on economic growth without implying any specific monetary policy action or change in stance."
}
```

This sentence does not suggest a tightening or loosening of monetary policy, nor does it express concern about inflation or economic downturn, which are typical characteristics of hawkish or dovish stances. Therefore, it is classified as neutral.
2025-04-15 01:12:46,439 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence highlights potential negative economic risks, suggesting a cautious tone and implying that the Swiss National Bank may be prepared to ease policy or maintain a supportive stance."
}
```

This sentence implies that the bank is concerned about potential economic downturns and their impact, which is a dovish signal. The tone is cautious and risk-focused, rather than inflation-focused or growth-optimistic, which would be more characteristic of hawkish or neutral stances.

1. **Understanding the Context**: The sentence mentions "the new curve is lower, with inflation stabilising at a level of 1.4." This implies a projection or forecast related to inflation.

2. **Interpreting the Terms**:
   - **Hawkish**: A hawkish stance is associated with concerns about inflation and a tendency to increase interest rates to combat it.
   - **Dovish**: A dovish stance prioritizes economic growth and employment over inflation, often leading to lower interest rates or quantitative easing.

The reasoning behind this classification is that an unchanged inflation rate of 0.2% suggests that the Swiss National Bank (SNB) does not see an immediate need to adjust its monetary policy stance, which is a characteristic of a neutral monetary policy stance. There is no indication of a hawkish (policy tightening) or dovish (policy loosening) stance.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence is a factual statement about banks' financial positions and does not convey a clear direction for future monetary policy, indicating a neutral stance."
}
```

This sentence does not suggest that the Swiss National Bank is likely to tighten (hawkish) or loosen (dovish) its monetary policy. Instead, it provides a neutral observation about the banks' current state. Therefore, I classify the sentence as "neutral".
2025-04-15 01:12:55,803 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a continued tightening of monetary policy to counter inflationary pressures, indicating a hawkish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence mentions a "significant tightening of monetary policy" and a desire to counter "remaining inflationary pressure", which suggests that the central bank is prioritizing inflation control over economic growth, a characteristic of a hawkish monetary policy stance.
2025-04-15 01:12:55,803 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions a factor boosting economic growth, but does not imply any change in monetary policy or a specific stance on inflation or interest rates."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply states a fact about exports contributing to economic growth without expressing a view on inflation, interest rates, or other monetary policy issues that would suggest a hawkish, dovish, or clearly dovish stance. The sentence is more of an observation about economic growth factors rather than a policy statement.
2025-04-15 01:12:55,803 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a factual change in inflation rate without indicating any future policy action or bias, hence it is neutral."
}
```

The sentence simply reports on a change in inflation rate without expressing any concern or suggesting a policy response, which would be characteristic of a hawkish (concerned about inflation and potentially raising interest rates) or dovish (concerned about growth and potentially lowering interest rates) stance. Therefore, it is classified as neutral.
2025-04-15 01:12:55,803 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses caution about the global economy's outlook, but does not suggest a clear inclination towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence neither expresses a strong hawkish tone (which would suggest a inclination towards raising interest rates) nor a dovish tone (which would suggest a inclination towards lowering interest rates). Instead, it highlights uncertainty, which is a balanced and neutral view.

2025-04-15 01:12:57,390 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To accurately classify the monetary policy stance and provide a justification, let's analyze the given sentence: "cash holdings in the last rp cash holdings component."

Given that the sentence seems incomplete or not directly related to a clear monetary policy stance (as it appears to discuss components of cash holdings without specifying an action or implication on interest rates, inflation, or economic growth), the best approach is to consider its relevance to monetary policy discussions.

The sentence does not explicitly convey a tightening (hawkish), loosening (dovish), or a neutral stance on monetary policy. Instead, it seems more like a technical or descriptive term that might be used in discussions

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence focuses on the economic condition that needs to recover, without mentioning any specific monetary policy action or stance."

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence simply reports a historical inflation rate without implying any future policy actions or changes in the monetary policy stance."

This sentence is neutral because it merely states a fact about past inflation without providing any insight into the Swiss National Bank's future policy intentions, thus not leaning towards a hawkish (concerned about inflation and potentially raising rates), dovish (concerned about growth and potentially lowering rates), or irrelevant (not related to monetary policy) classification.

The reasoning behind this classification is that the sentence mentions weak GDP momentum and a lower growth forecast, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance, characteristic of a dovish tone.

The sentence implies that the Swiss National Bank may maintain or adopt a loose monetary policy stance due to the mentioned economic conditions, which is consistent with a dovish monetary policy stance.
2025-04-15 01:13:01,932 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance of the given sentence and provide a concise justification, let's analyze it step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Sentence
The sentence provided is: "Moreover, it assumes that the dollar will hover around its current level against the euro and that the oil price will be about $25 per barrel." This sentence discusses assumptions about future currency and commodity prices.

## 2: Determine the Implications of Assumptions
- Assuming the dollar will hover around its current level against the euro implies a stable exchange rate, which does not directly suggest a tightening or loosening of monetary policy.
- Assuming an oil price of about

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence does not provide any information about the Swiss National Bank's monetary policy stance or actions."
}
```

I chose "irrelevant" because the sentence only reports on a specific market trend (residential investment property segment) without mentioning any monetary policy decisions, intentions, or implications, making it unrelated to the Swiss National Bank's monetary policy meeting.
2025-04-15 01:13:01,932 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions that the expansionary monetary policy remains unchanged, indicating no shift in stance, and only notes an expected increase in inflation as a consequence of high resource utilization."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence does not indicate a tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) of monetary policy, but rather a neutral stance as the policy remains unchanged. The mention of an increase in inflation does not imply a change in policy stance, but rather a consequence of the current policy and economic conditions.

2025-04-15 01:13:05,468 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides factual information about lending growth without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance or expressing concerns about inflation or economic growth that would suggest a hawkish or dovish tone."
}
```

The sentence appears to be a factual observation about lending growth and does not convey a clear policy intention or concern that would lean towards a hawkish (concerned about inflation) or dovish (concerned about growth) stance. Therefore, it is classified as neutral.
2025-04-15 01:13:05,468 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance of the given sentence and provide a justification, let's analyze it step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Context
The sentence provided is: "while many service industries fared well, there was a renewed slight decline in value added in manufacturing." This sentence appears to be describing economic conditions rather than directly stating a monetary policy stance.

## 2: Identify Key Elements
The key elements here are the performance of service industries and the decline in manufacturing value added. The sentence indicates a mixed economic performance but leans towards a slightly negative tone due to the decline in manufacturing.

## 3: Relate
2025-04-15 01:13:05,468 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a weakening economy with declining GDP and a deteriorating labor market, which typically calls for a more accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

This sentence implies that the economy is experiencing difficulties, which is a dovish signal, as it may lead to a more expansionary monetary policy to support the economy.
2025-04-15 01:13:05,468 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions uncertainty in the inflation forecast, which does not explicitly convey a hawkish, dovish, or clearly neutral stance, but rather a cautious tone."
}
```

However, upon reevaluating, I think a more accurate classification would be:

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence does not provide any information about the Swiss National Bank's monetary policy stance, as it only mentions uncertainty in the inflation forecast."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply states a fact about the economy without implying any specific action or direction for monetary policy, which is consistent with a neutral stance.

  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a potential easing of inflationary pressures due to a forecasted decline in oil prices, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance."

```

The reasoning behind this classification is that a dovish monetary policy stance is often associated with a more accommodative or expansionary policy, which can be supported by lower oil prices and reduced inflationary pressures. The sentence's focus on a forecasted decline in oil prices suggests that the Swiss National Bank may be considering a more dovish stance to mitigate potential economic risks.

2025-04-15 01:13:11,731 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To accurately classify the monetary policy stance and provide a justification, let's analyze the given sentence: "interest on sight deposit account balances."

The sentence seems to refer to a specific aspect of monetary policy implementation, particularly how the central bank handles interest on deposits held by banks at the central bank. However, without explicit context indicating an increase, decrease, or maintenance of current interest rates or a specific tone (hawkish, dovish, or neutral) regarding future monetary policy, we must infer based on typical interpretations:

- **Hawkish** refers to a stance that is more inclined towards controlling inflation, often through higher interest rates.

I chose "neutral" because the sentence is factual and doesn't convey a clear direction or tone of the monetary policy stance. 

However, an alternative and arguably better classification could be:

```

{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a cautious tone regarding the global economy, implying a potential easing of monetary policy, which is characteristic of a dovish stance."

The reasoning behind this classification is that the mention of "high" uncertainty about the future outlook for the global economy may lead to a more accommodative monetary policy, which is typically associated with a dovish stance.

This classification is based on the understanding that:

* Dovish: implies a preference for accommodative monetary policies, which is often associated with lower interest rates and more stimulus.
* Hawkish: implies a preference for tighter monetary policies, which is often associated with higher interest rates and less stimulus.
* Neutral: implies a balanced or middle-ground approach to monetary
