A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence provided is: "after stagnating in the second half of 2018, gdp growth is thus likely to pick up again somewhat."

Let's break down the task:

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence contains the phrase "is thus likely to pick up again somewhat," which indicates a degree of uncertainty or prediction about future GDP growth.

2. **Justification**: The use of "likely" and "somewhat" in the sentence introduces uncertainty
2025-04-15 01:15:38,270 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, "the european economy will continue to perform favourably", we need to assess its certainty.

The sentence is making a prediction about the future performance of the European economy. Predictions about future events, especially those related to economic performance, are inherently uncertain because they depend on a multitude of factors that can change or be influenced in unforeseen ways.

Given this, the sentence should be classified based on its predictive nature.
