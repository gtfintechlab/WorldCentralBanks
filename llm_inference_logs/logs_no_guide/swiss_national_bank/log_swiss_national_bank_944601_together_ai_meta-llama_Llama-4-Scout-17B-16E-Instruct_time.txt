A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

2025-04-15 01:23:52,772 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence provides information about a past document (instruction sheet) and does not discuss future economic conditions, policies, or actions."

2025-04-15 01:23:52,772 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence is forward looking because it makes an assumption about the future value of the three-month libor rate."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "forward looking" because it discusses a future projection (inflation forecast) based on an assumption about a future interest rate (three-month libor rate), indicating that it looks ahead to future events or conditions.
2025-04-15 01:23:52,772 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses the Swiss National Bank's intention for a future period ('for the time being'), indicating a forward-looking statement."
}
```
2025-04-15 01:23:52,772 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a current policy decision without expressing a future intention or prediction."
}
```

The sentence simply states a current action taken by the Swiss National Bank (leaving the target range for the three-month LIBOR at 0.00-0.25), without providing any information about future policy plans or expectations. Therefore, it is classified as "not forward looking".

{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence focuses on the current necessity of the SNB's monetary policy, rather than making a prediction or statement about future actions or conditions."

```

Although the sentence mentions "ensuring appropriate monetary conditions", which could be seen as a forward-looking goal, the overall tone is focused on the current situation ("in these exceptional circumstances") and the ongoing necessity of the policy, rather than making a forward-looking statement about what will happen or what actions will be taken in the future.

{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence contains projections for future years (2006 and 2007), indicating a forward-looking perspective."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "forward looking" because it discusses expected future values (annual inflation in 2006 and 2007), which implies a projection or prediction about future events.
