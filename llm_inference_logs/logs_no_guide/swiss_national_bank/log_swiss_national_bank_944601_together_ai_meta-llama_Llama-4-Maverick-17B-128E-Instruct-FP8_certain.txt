A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "discussions with company representatives conducted by the snbs delegates for regional economic relations also suggest a moderate improvement of the economic situation."

First, we observe that the sentence is discussing the outcome of discussions held by the SNB's delegates. The key verb here is "suggest," which often indicates a degree of tentativeness or uncertainty rather than a definitive statement.

Given this, the classification should lean towards "uncertain" because the sentence does not state that there is a moderate improvement but rather that discussions suggest such an improvement, implying an interpretation or inference

The sentence is: "however, it is likely that global production capacity will be underutilised for some time to come and inflation will remain modest in most countries."

1. **Label Assignment**: The key phrases to focus on are "it is likely that" which indicates a degree of probability rather than certainty.

2. **Justification**: The use of "it is likely that" suggests that the statement is making a probabilistic prediction rather than a definitive assertion.

The sentence is: "due to the substantial risks associated with the future path of the international economy, financial markets and energy prices, this forecast involves considerable uncertainties."

Here's my analysis:

- The sentence explicitly mentions "substantial risks" associated with several key economic factors.
- It directly states that the forecast "involves considerable uncertainties."

Given these points, the sentence clearly indicates a lack of certainty regarding the forecast due to various risk factors.

Therefore, my classification is:

The sentence is: "owing to a slight deterioration in the outlook for the global economy, medium-term inflation is somewhat lower than predicted in september."

First, we observe the language used. The phrase "outlook for the global economy" indicates a forecast or prediction, which inherently involves uncertainty. The word "slight" and "somewhat" also suggest a degree of uncertainty or imprecision in the assessment or prediction being made.

Let's break down the task:

The sentence is: "an appreciation of the swiss franc would compromise price stability and would have serious consequences for the swiss economy."

This sentence discusses a hypothetical scenario and its potential consequences. The use of "would" indicates a conditional or hypothetical situation rather than a statement of fact or certainty about the current or past state.

Given this, the classification should reflect the conditional nature of the statement.

The sentence provided is: "on the one hand, new waves of infection could weigh on economic activity again."

Let's break down the task:

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence discusses the potential impact of "new waves of infection" on economic activity, using the phrase "could weigh." This indicates a possibility rather than a certainty.

2. **Justification**: The use of "could" signifies uncertainty because it introduces a potential outcome that may or may not occur.

Therefore,

The sentence is: "since the last assessment, the swiss franc has appreciated substantially against the euro and the us dollar."

1. **Understanding the sentence**: The sentence is stating a fact about the change in the value of the Swiss Franc relative to the Euro and the US Dollar since the last assessment.

2. **Determining certainty**: The sentence is phrased as a statement of fact, indicating a clear and observed change ("has appreciated substantially"). There's no conditional or speculative language used.

3. **Classification**:
   - The sentence is making a definitive statement about a past

The sentence is: "should the economy deteriorate more severely than expected, there would be a risk of negative inflation."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence discusses a potential future scenario and its consequence, indicating a level of conditionality rather than a statement of fact.

2. **Justification**: The use of "should" and "would be" indicates a hypothetical or conditional situation, suggesting uncertainty about the actual occurrence of the condition (economy deteriorating more severely than expected) and its consequence (risk of negative inflation).

Therefore, the classification is as follows:

```
2025-04-15 01:26:09,351 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, I will analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "the core inflation rate calculated by the national bank currently amounts to 0.7".

1. I will assign a label based on the certainty or uncertainty conveyed by the sentence.
