A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

2025-04-15 01:20:31,488 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and implications.

The sentence is: "moreover, although the financial industry is well into the process of recovery, another deterioration cannot be entirely ruled out."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence implies that while the financial industry is recovering, there is still a possibility of another deterioration. The key phrase here is "cannot be entirely ruled out," which indicates a level of uncertainty regarding future events.

2. **Justification**: The use of "cannot be entirely ruled out" suggests that there is a possibility, however small or uncertain, of another deterioration, indicating uncertainty.

3. **Output
2025-04-15 01:20:31,488 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "however, the inflation forecast shows that the expansionary monetary policy cannot be maintained indefinitely without compromising medium and long-term price stability."

This sentence is based on a forecast, which inherently involves some level of prediction or expectation about future events. However, the statement is presented as a conclusion derived from the inflation forecast, indicating a level of certainty about the outcome of maintaining an expansionary monetary policy indefinitely.

The key phrase here is "cannot be maintained indefinitely," which is a definitive statement about the sustainability of the current monetary policy based on the forecast. The use of
2025-04-15 01:20:31,488 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, I will follow the instructions and analyze its content.

The sentence is: "the forecast is still associated with considerable uncertainties"

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence directly mentions "considerable uncertainties" in relation to the forecast. This indicates a lack of confidence or clarity in the forecast, which aligns with the definition of uncertainty.

2. **Justification**: The phrase "considerable uncertainties" explicitly conveys that there is doubt or a lack of sureness regarding the forecast.

Therefore, based on the presence of the phrase "considerable uncertainties," the sentence should be classified as "uncertain."

Here's the output in
2025-04-15 01:20:31,488 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze it step by step.

The sentence is: "at the end of the year, gdp and employment were still significantly below precrisis levels in most countries."

1. **Understanding the sentence**: The sentence is discussing the state of GDP and employment in relation to their pre-crisis levels at the end of a specific year. It is making a statement about past economic conditions.

2. **Identifying certainty or uncertainty**: To determine if the sentence is certain or uncertain, we need to look for words or phrases that indicate doubt, possibility, or fact. The sentence states a fact about the past ("were
2025-04-15 01:20:31,488 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, we first need to analyze its content and tone regarding the Swiss National Bank's monetary policy meeting or related economic conditions.

The sentence provided is: "uncertainty about the future outlook for the global economy remains exceptionally high and the risks for the global financial system have increased substantially."

Let's break it down:

1. **Content Analysis**: The sentence explicitly mentions "uncertainty" about the future outlook for the global economy and notes an increase in risks for the global financial system. These are indicators of a lack of confidence or clarity about future economic conditions.

2. **Tone and Implications**: The use of the words "exception

The sentence is: "for 2020, we expect to see inflation of 1.6, compared with 1.9 forecast in the last quarter."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence is making a statement about a future expectation (inflation rate for 2020) and comparing it to a previous forecast. The key here is understanding whether this statement is presented as a fact or an uncertainty.

2. **Analysis**: The sentence uses the phrase "we expect to see," which indicates a prediction or forecast rather than a certainty. It is comparing a current
2025-04-15 01:20:41,524 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, "the situation on the financial markets has eased somewhat recently," we need to assess its certainty based on the language used.

The sentence is stating a fact or an observation about the financial markets, but it includes the word "somewhat," which indicates a degree of uncertainty or vagueness regarding the extent of the easing.

Given this, the classification would be as follows:

The sentence is: "to ensure appropriate monetary conditions, the snb is also willing to be active in the foreign exchange market as necessary."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence implies a conditional action ("as necessary") that depends on future conditions or assessments, indicating a level of uncertainty regarding whether the action will be taken.

2. **Justification**: The use of "as necessary" introduces uncertainty because it implies that the SNB's action in the foreign exchange market is contingent upon future conditions or needs that are not predetermined.

The sentence is: "the actual inflationary pressure is currently underestimated somewhat by the cpi"

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence implies a degree of uncertainty or a nuanced view regarding the current inflationary pressure as measured by the CPI (Consumer Price Index). The use of "underestimated somewhat" suggests a level of doubt or a recognized margin of error in the CPI's measurement.

2. **Justification**: The presence of the word "somewhat" indicates a degree of uncertainty or imprecision in the statement, suggesting that the extent of underestimation is not precisely known

The sentence is: "on the assumption of an unchanged three-month libor of 2.00, it expects annual inflation to reach 0.4 in 2007 and 0.9 in 2008."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence is making a statement about an expectation based on a specific assumption. The use of "expects" and an "assumption" indicates a degree of conditionality rather than a statement of fact.

2. **Justification**: The sentence is classified as "uncertain" because it is based on an assumption about future

The sentence is: "the conditional inflation forecast shows that there is no threat to price stability in the short term."

1. **Understanding the Sentence**: The sentence refers to a forecast related to inflation and its impact on price stability. It specifies that the forecast is "conditional," which implies that it is based on certain assumptions or conditions.

2. **Analyzing Certainty**: 
   - The use of "conditional" indicates that the forecast is dependent on specific conditions being met, which inherently introduces a level of uncertainty because the actual outcome could differ if those conditions are not met
2025-04-15 01:21:15,343 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and structure.

The sentence is: "as a result, inflation will be higher in 2011 and, particularly, in 2012, if the current expansionary monetary policy is maintained indefinitely."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence contains a conditional statement ("if the current expansionary monetary policy is maintained indefinitely") that directly impacts the assertion made about future inflation rates. This indicates that the outcome (inflation being higher) is dependent on a specific condition being met.

2. **Justification**: The presence of the conditional clause ("if...") introduces uncertainty because it makes the outcome
