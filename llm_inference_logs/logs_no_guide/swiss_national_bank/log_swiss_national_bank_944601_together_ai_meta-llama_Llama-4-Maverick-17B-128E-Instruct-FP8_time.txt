A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "however, production capacity will remain underutilised for some time yet."

1. **Understanding the sentence**: The sentence discusses the future state of production capacity in relation to being underutilized.

2. **Identifying key elements**: The phrase "will remain" is a key indicator of future tense, suggesting that the statement is about a future condition.

3. **Classifying the sentence**:
   - The sentence is talking about a future state ("will remain underutilised"), which indicates it is making a statement about what is expected to happen in the future

The sentence is: "orders received and the order backlog in industry still fall short of the desired level, and demand for export goods continues to be modest."

This sentence discusses current conditions or states ("still fall short," "continues to be modest") rather than making a statement about future actions, expectations, or policies directly.

However, discussing current conditions often has implications for future expectations or decisions. Let's directly assess if it is forward-looking.

The sentence implies a current assessment that could influence future decisions or expectations but does not directly state a future action or policy direction.

The sentence is: "the broad-based, healthy economic situation had a positive impact on the labour market."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence discusses the current or past state of the economy and its effect on the labour market. It does not explicitly mention or imply future actions, expectations, or conditions related to the Swiss National Bank's monetary policy.

2. **Justification**: The sentence is describing a past or current situation and its impact, without directly referencing future expectations or policy directions.
