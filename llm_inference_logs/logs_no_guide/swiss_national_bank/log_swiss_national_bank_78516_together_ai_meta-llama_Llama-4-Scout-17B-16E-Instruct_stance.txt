A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

2025-04-15 01:17:25,880 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a cautious tone, implying that the speaker is concerned about potential risks and downside scenarios, which is a characteristic of a dovish stance."
}
```

The reasoning behind this classification is that the sentence expresses concern about potential deterioration in the financial industry, which indicates a cautious and potentially accommodative monetary policy stance, typical of a dovish classification.
2025-04-15 01:17:25,880 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies that the current expansionary monetary policy may need to be tightened to maintain medium and long-term price stability, indicating a hawkish tone."
}
```

This classification is based on the idea that a hawkish stance is associated with concerns about inflation and a desire to maintain price stability, which is reflected in the sentence's mention of the potential need to adjust policy to avoid compromising medium and long-term price stability.
2025-04-15 01:17:25,880 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions uncertainty but does not indicate a clear inclination towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence acknowledges uncertainty but does not convey a specific direction or bias in monetary policy, which is a key characteristic of a neutral stance.
2025-04-15 01:17:25,880 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence highlights that GDP and employment were still significantly below pre-crisis levels, suggesting a need for accommodative monetary policy, which is a dovish stance."
}
```

The sentence implies that the economic recovery is incomplete, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance, characteristic of a dovish approach.
2025-04-15 01:17:25,880 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a cautious tone, highlighting increased risks and uncertainty, which is typically associated with a dovish stance, implying a potential easing of monetary policy."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence expresses concerns about the global economy and financial system, which is often a precursor to a dovish monetary policy stance, characterized by a willingness to implement expansionary policies to mitigate risks.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies that the Swiss National Bank can maintain a accommodative stance due to a benign inflation outlook, suggesting a dovish tone."

```

The sentence suggests that the bank can afford to keep its policy stance loose for now, given the medium-term inflation outlook, which is a characteristic of a dovish monetary policy stance.
2025-04-15 01:17:27,664 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions a potential risk but does not explicitly indicate a change in monetary policy, thus maintaining a neutral stance."

The sentence provided does not explicitly indicate a tightening or loosening of monetary policy but rather highlights a potential risk related to the energy situation in Europe. This kind of statement is more aligned with a neutral stance as it neither clearly expresses a hawkish (concerned with inflation and potentially raising interest rates) nor a dovish (concerned with economic growth and potentially lowering interest rates) view.

This sentence does not express a clear hawkish (concerned about inflation, likely to raise interest rates) or dovish (concerned about growth, likely to lower interest rates) stance. Instead, it presents a neutral view by highlighting uncertainty, which is consistent with a wait-and-see approach. Therefore, I classify the monetary policy stance as "neutral".

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates that the Swiss National Bank is maintaining an expansionary monetary policy and keeping the attractiveness of Swiss franc investments low, suggesting a loose monetary policy stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence mentions "maintaining its expansionary monetary policy", which implies a dovish stance, and also mentions keeping the attractiveness of Swiss franc investments low, which suggests that the bank is trying to stimulate the economy, further supporting a dovish classification.
2025-04-15 01:17:29,227 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a moderately positive momentum in economic indicators, which is a neutral observation and does not imply a clear direction for monetary policy, thus indicating a neutral stance."
}
```
2025-04-15 01:17:29,227 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual explanation for a revision and does not convey a clear stance on monetary policy, indicating a neutral tone."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply provides a factual explanation for a revision and does not express a clear opinion or direction on monetary policy, which would be characteristic of a hawkish or dovish stance.
2025-04-15 01:17:29,227 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence is a factual statement about economic data and does not convey a clear stance on monetary policy."
}
```

The sentence simply reports on the unexpected magnitude of the contraction in demand without expressing a view on future policy actions or the economy that would suggest a hawkish, dovish, or clearly dovish or hawkish tone. Therefore, it is classified as neutral.
2025-04-15 01:17:29,227 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a neutral, factual assessment of global economic growth without implying any specific monetary policy action or bias."
}
```

This sentence simply reports on the state of global economic growth without expressing a view that would lean towards tightening (hawkish) or easing (dovish) monetary policy, nor does it seem unrelated to monetary policy discussions (irrelevant). Therefore, it is classified as neutral.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence highlights potential negative economic risks, suggesting a cautious tone and implying that the Swiss National Bank may be prepared to ease policy or maintain a supportive stance."

This sentence implies that the bank is concerned about potential economic downturns and their impact, which is a dovish signal. The tone is cautious and risk-focused, rather than inflation-focused or growth-optimistic, which would be more characteristic of hawkish or neutral stances.

  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The Swiss National Bank's decision to raise the target range for the three-month LIBOR by 0.25 percentage points indicates a tightening of monetary policy, which is a hawkish stance."

```

This classification is based on the fact that raising interest rates or in this case, the target range for the three-month LIBOR, is a typical hawkish monetary policy move aimed at curbing inflation or reducing economic growth.

```
{

  "justification": "The sentence suggests that monetary policy will help to moderate levels, implying a loose or accommodative monetary policy stance."

The reasoning behind this classification is that the mention of "monetary policy" contributing to a return to more moderate levels implies that the policy is expected to be eased or remain accommodative, which is a characteristic of a dovish stance.

2025-04-15 01:17:30,799 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance based on the given sentence, let's analyze it step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Context
The sentence provides inflation forecasts for 2019, 2020, and 2021 as 0.4, 0.1, and 0.5, respectively. This information is related to the Swiss National Bank's (SNB) monetary policy meeting, which typically discusses and decides on interest rates and other monetary policy measures to achieve its inflation target.

## 2: Recall Monetary Policy Stance Definitions
- **Hawkish**: A stance that suggests a possibility of increasing interest

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a wait-and-see approach, indicating a neutral stance as it implies that the Swiss National Bank will adjust its policy in response to confirmed economic recovery signs, without specifying the direction of the adjustment."
}
```
2025-04-15 01:17:32,059 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a gradual adjustment of monetary policy as economic recovery progresses, indicating a balanced and cautious approach rather than a clear tightening or easing bias."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence does not indicate a clear inclination towards tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) monetary policy, but rather a measured and adaptive approach, which is characteristic of a neutral stance.
2025-04-15 01:17:32,059 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual update on economic activity without implying any change in monetary policy, hence it has a neutral tone."
}
```

The sentence simply reports on the current state of economic activity without suggesting any specific action or direction from the Swiss National Bank, which is why I classified it as "neutral".
2025-04-15 01:17:32,059 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence focuses on explaining the drivers of growth without mentioning any specific monetary policy actions or inclinations, indicating a neutral stance."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence provides information about the factors contributing to growth, such as manufacturing and the weaker Swiss franc, without expressing any concerns about inflation, growth, or interest rates that would suggest a hawkish or dovish stance.
2025-04-15 01:17:32,059 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual update on the M3 aggregate without indicating a change in the monetary policy stance, hence it is neutral."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply reports a change in the M3 aggregate without expressing a clear intention to tighten (hawkish) or loosen (dovish) monetary policy.

I chose "neutral" because the sentence is more of a statement of uncertainty rather than a clear indication of a hawkish (favoring tighter monetary policy) or dovish (favoring looser monetary policy) stance. The sentence does not provide any information that would suggest a specific direction for monetary policy, hence the classification as neutral.

The reasoning behind this classification is that the mention of the economy losing momentum "again somewhat of late" has a slightly negative tone, which could be interpreted as a signal that the Swiss National Bank might be inclined to adopt a more accommodative monetary policy stance, characteristic of a dovish approach.

2025-04-15 01:17:34,799 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The mention of rising inflation suggests a potential concern for price stability, which is typically associated with a hawkish monetary policy stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the idea that a hawkish stance is characterized by a focus on controlling inflation, and the sentence's mention of rising inflation implies that the Swiss National Bank may be concerned about inflationary pressures, which could lead to a tightening of monetary policy.
2025-04-15 01:17:34,799 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that inflation will dip into negative territory, implying a potential easing of monetary policy, which is a dovish stance."
}
```

This sentence implies that the Swiss National Bank may adopt a more accommodative monetary policy stance, as a negative inflation rate (or deflation) often prompts central banks to implement expansionary policies. This tone is characteristic of a dovish monetary policy stance.
2025-04-15 01:17:34,799 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The downward revision of the inflation forecast suggests a more accommodative monetary policy stance, which is characteristic of a dovish tone."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence implies a decrease in the inflation forecast, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy, a typical characteristic of a dovish stance.
2025-04-15 01:17:34,799 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a positive development in the financial markets, which could imply a less need for aggressive monetary policy, aligning with a dovish stance."
}
```

The reasoning behind this classification is that the sentence implies that the situation has improved, which might lead to a more accommodative monetary policy, characteristic of a dovish stance.
2025-04-15 01:17:34,799 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a positive outlook without indicating any change in monetary policy, suggesting a neutral stance."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence is optimistic about future developments but does not provide any specific guidance on future policy actions, which is consistent with a neutral monetary policy stance.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual inflation rate projection without implying any change in the monetary policy stance."

```

This sentence simply states a projection for the inflation rate without suggesting any action or change in the monetary policy stance, which is why I classified it as "neutral".

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions uncertainties but does not indicate a clear inclination towards tightening or loosening monetary policy."

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply states that there are uncertainties related to the global economy and the financial industry, without expressing a clear hawkish (concerned about inflation) or dovish (concerned about growth) tone.
2025-04-15 01:17:37,677 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my attempt to classify the sentence:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence is too vague to indicate a clear monetary policy stance, as it only mentions a revision of assumptions without specifying any changes to policy or outlook."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence does not provide enough information to suggest a hawkish (more aggressive tightening) or dovish (more accommodative) stance. The sentence appears to be simply reporting a factual update without implying any specific policy direction.

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence does not indicate any intention to tighten (hawkish) or loosen (dovish) monetary policy, but rather assumes a stable policy rate over the forecast horizon, which suggests a neutral stance.
2025-04-15 01:17:37,677 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```

The sentence seems to provide a specific technical condition regarding the exemption threshold and its relation to the basic minimum reserve requirement, without expressing a clear direction or tone that would indicate a hawkish (favoring tighter monetary policy), dovish (favoring looser monetary policy), or irrelevant (not related to monetary policy) stance. Therefore, it is classified as neutral.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that weaker global economic activity would negatively impact Switzerland's economic growth, implying a concern for economic stability and potentially leading to a more accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

This sentence implies that the speaker is concerned about the potential negative effects of weaker global economic activity on Switzerland's economy, which is a dovish stance. The speaker is not mentioning inflation or the need to tighten policy, which are typically hawkish concerns, but rather expressing worry about economic growth, which is a dovish preoccupation.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions a modification of assumptions on international economic development, but does not convey a clear direction or tone on monetary policy, indicating a neutral stance."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply reports a change in assumptions without expressing a clear intention to tighten (hawkish) or loosen (dovish) monetary policy. The tone is informative and factual, rather than suggestive of a specific policy direction.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence does not convey any clear indication of a tightening or loosening bias in monetary policy, instead focusing on the state of the financial industry."

```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence is more of a factual statement about the financial industry's state and does not express a clear stance on monetary policy. There is no indication of a hawkish (concerned about inflation and potentially raising rates) or dovish (concerned about growth and potentially lowering rates) tone.

My reasoning is that a strong rise in mortgage lending and residential property prices may indicate potential inflationary pressures and financial stability risks, which could lead the Swiss National Bank to consider tightening monetary policy, a hawkish stance.

{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The downward revision of inflation expectations suggests a more accommodative monetary policy stance, which is characteristic of a dovish tone."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that a downward revision of inflation expectations can lead to a more accommodative monetary policy, which is often associated with a dovish stance. The Swiss National Bank's (SNB) expectation of lower inflation may lead to a delay in tightening monetary policy or even a cut in interest rates, which is a dovish signal.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that the global economy will face headwinds, implying a potential need for accommodative monetary policy, which is a dovish stance."
}
```

The reasoning is that a dovish monetary policy stance is characterized by a concern for economic growth and a willingness to implement expansionary policies if necessary. The sentence's focus on factors holding back the global economy implies that the speaker may be inclined to maintain or implement policies that support growth, which is in line with a dovish stance.
2025-04-15 01:17:43,523 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a strong economy, which could lead to inflationary pressures and a more hawkish monetary policy stance."
}
```

The sentence implies that the economy is performing well, with GDP growth exceeding potential growth, which is a sign of a strong economy. This type of language is often associated with a hawkish monetary policy stance, as it suggests that the central bank may need to tighten policy to prevent overheating.
2025-04-15 01:17:43,523 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The Swiss National Bank's decision to lower the policy rate indicates a loosening of monetary policy, which is a dovish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that a rate cut is a expansionary monetary policy move, which is typically associated with a dovish stance.
2025-04-15 01:17:43,523 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that the Swiss National Bank is willing to take action to counter the tightening of monetary conditions, indicating a loosening bias and a dovish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence implies the central bank is prepared to act to mitigate the effects of an appreciation of the Swiss franc, which is a sign of a dovish or accommodative monetary policy stance.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a neutral outlook on growth, indicating a slight decline but still remaining above potential, without suggesting any drastic changes in monetary policy."

I chose "neutral" because the sentence provides a balanced view of the growth prospects without indicating any significant concerns that would necessitate a change in the monetary policy stance, which is a characteristic of a neutral tone.

2025-04-15 01:17:45,225 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance based on the given sentence, let's analyze it:

 Sentence: "the new forecast stands at 2.1 for 2022, and 0.9 for 2023 and 2024 cf"

The sentence provides inflation forecasts for 2022, 2023, and 2024 but does not directly indicate a tightening, easing, or maintaining of the current policy. However, we can infer the stance based on typical interpretations:

- **Hawkish** refers to a policy stance that is more inclined towards fighting inflation, often through raising interest rates or reducing money supply, indicating concern about inflation
2025-04-15 01:17:45,225 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence provides technical information about the calculation of the exemption threshold and does not convey any stance on monetary policy."
}
```

This sentence appears to be a technical note and does not express a view on the economy, interest rates, or inflation, which are typical aspects of monetary policy discussions. Therefore, it is classified as "irrelevant" to the monetary policy stance.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates no change in the policy rate and interest on sight deposits, suggesting a neutral stance with no tightening or loosening of monetary policy."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that keeping the policy rate and interest on sight deposits unchanged at 0.75% implies no shift towards a more hawkish (tightening) or dovish (loosening) stance, hence neutral.
2025-04-15 01:17:46,596 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The downward adjustment of the inflation forecast suggests a more accommodative monetary policy stance, which is characteristic of a dovish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the idea that a downward revision of the inflation forecast could lead to a more relaxed monetary policy, as it implies that inflationary pressures are expected to be lower than previously thought. This is consistent with a dovish monetary policy stance, which tends to prioritize economic growth and employment over inflation concerns.
2025-04-15 01:17:46,596 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies that the Swiss National Bank is taking accommodative measures to provide sufficient liquidity to the interbank market, indicating a dovish monetary policy stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence mentions the SNB's efforts to provide liquidity in response to increased demand, which suggests a loosening of monetary policy to support the financial system. This is a characteristic of a dovish monetary policy stance.
2025-04-15 01:17:46,596 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The Swiss National Bank is leaving the target range for the three-month LIBOR unchanged, indicating no immediate plans to tighten or loosen monetary policy."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that leaving the target range unchanged suggests that the SNB is maintaining its current stance, which is neither hawkish (indicating a tendency to raise interest rates) nor dovish (indicating a tendency to lower interest rates). Therefore, the label "neutral" is assigned.
2025-04-15 01:17:46,596 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a weak economic condition in the euro area, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

My reasoning is that a recession in the euro area would likely lead to a dovish monetary policy stance, as it would necessitate stimulus to support economic recovery. The sentence does not directly mention the Swiss National Bank's policy, but the context implies that a dovish stance could be considered to mitigate the impact of the recession on the Swiss economy.

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply reports on the current state of the economy without expressing a view on the direction of interest rates or the need for policy action, which is a key aspect of hawkish, dovish, or even implicitly dovish/hawkish stances.

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a concern about potential inflationary pressures, implying a cautious stance towards possible future rate hikes."
}
```

The sentence implies that the speaker is concerned about the potential for higher production costs to be passed on to prices, which is a hawkish concern. This indicates that the speaker may be inclined to take a more restrictive monetary policy stance to mitigate these risks, which is consistent with a hawkish label.

  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates an increase in the target range for the three-month LIBOR, suggesting a tightening of monetary policy, which is a hawkish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that a hike in interest rates (or in this case, the target range for LIBOR) is typically considered a hawkish move, as it aims to curb inflation or slow down an overheating economy.

This sentence appears to be providing context about the current economic situation in Switzerland, specifically regarding competitive pressure and margins for export firms, but it does not suggest a clear direction or stance on monetary policy that would classify it as hawkish (favoring tighter monetary policy), dovish (favoring looser monetary policy), or directly indicate that it's irrelevant to monetary policy discussions.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a gradual pickup in growth without indicating any immediate changes to monetary policy, implying a neutral stance."
}
```

The sentence provided does not suggest that the Swiss National Bank is likely to tighten (hawkish) or loosen (dovish) its monetary policy. Instead, it offers a somewhat positive outlook on future growth without specifying any action, which aligns with a neutral monetary policy stance. Therefore, the classification as "neutral" seems appropriate.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The Swiss National Bank's decision to raise the exemption threshold and reduce the negative interest burden on the banking system indicates an accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

This sentence suggests that the SNB is taking a measure to alleviate the burden on banks, which implies a dovish or accommodative monetary policy stance. The action of reducing the negative interest burden is expected to support the banking system, which is a characteristic of dovish monetary policy.
2025-04-15 01:17:55,028 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence reports on GDP growth in Switzerland without providing any direct information about the Swiss National Bank's monetary policy stance or future actions."
}
```

This sentence is neutral because it simply reports on economic data (GDP growth) without providing any indication of the Swiss National Bank's future policy intentions or bias, which would be required to classify it as hawkish, dovish, or even directly relevant to their monetary policy stance.
2025-04-15 01:17:55,028 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The statement implies that the Swiss National Bank may need to adjust its policy to weaken the Swiss franc, suggesting a dovish stance."
}
```

The reasoning behind this classification is that the sentence suggests that the current rate is still too high, which could be interpreted as a signal that the central bank might be inclined to ease monetary policy to bring down the value of the Swiss franc, which is a dovish stance.

{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides inflation forecasts without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance, suggesting a neutral tone."

The reasoning behind this classification is that the sentence simply presents inflation forecasts for the next few years without expressing any intention to tighten (hawkish) or loosen (dovish) monetary policy, nor does it seem unrelated to monetary policy (irrelevant). Therefore, it is classified as neutral.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual observation about economic growth without expressing a clear stance on monetary policy."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply reports on a historical trend in growth rate without indicating any intention to tighten (hawkish) or loosen (dovish) monetary policy. The sentence appears to be a factual statement, which is why I did not classify it as "hawkish", "dovish", or "irrelevant".
2025-04-15 01:17:59,092 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a forecast for GDP growth without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance or expressing concerns about inflation, suggesting a neutral tone."
}
```
2025-04-15 01:17:59,092 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that the SNB will intervene to weaken the Swiss franc, indicating a loose monetary policy stance, which is characteristic of a dovish stance."
}
```

In this case, I classified the sentence as "dovish" because the SNB's intention to prevent an appreciation of the Swiss franc implies that it is willing to take action to ease monetary conditions, which is a dovish policy stance.
2025-04-15 01:17:59,092 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions weak economic growth, moderate price pressure, and an expected decline in oil prices, suggesting a rationale for accommodative monetary policy."
}
```

The sentence implies that the Swiss National Bank may maintain or adopt a loose monetary policy stance due to the mentioned economic conditions, which is consistent with a dovish monetary policy stance.
2025-04-15 01:17:59,092 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual update on inflation projections without indicating a change in the monetary policy stance, suggesting a neutral tone."
}
```

The reasoning behind this classification is that the sentence simply reports a slight increase in the inflation rate projection without expressing any intention to tighten or loosen monetary policy, which is consistent with a neutral stance.

2025-04-15 01:18:00,393 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates a reduction in the target interest rate range and a commitment to keep rates low, signaling an accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence mentions a cut in the target range for the three-month LIBOR and an announcement to keep the rate in the lower part of the new target range, which are indications of a dovish or expansionary monetary policy stance.
2025-04-15 01:18:00,393 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a concern about inflation being above central banks' targets, suggesting a potentially hawkish stance to combat inflation."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence highlights inflation being above central banks' targets, which is a concern that often leads to a hawkish monetary policy stance, focused on raising interest rates to curb inflation.
2025-04-15 01:18:00,393 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies that unchanged monetary policy would lead to rising inflation, suggesting a concern about inflation and a potential need for tightening, which is a hawkish stance."
}
```
2025-04-15 01:18:00,393 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence focuses on a specific economic aspect (exports) needed for recovery, without indicating any change in interest rates or monetary policy bias."
}
```

This sentence seems to be more of an observation or an analysis of what the economy needs to recover, rather than a clear indication of a hawkish (favoring higher interest rates) or dovish (favoring lower interest rates) stance. Therefore, I classified it as "neutral".
2025-04-15 01:18:00,393 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The statement suggests that the Swiss National Bank is comfortable with a weaker Swiss franc, implying a loose monetary policy stance."
}
```

The reasoning behind this classification is that a dovish stance is typically associated with a preference for looser monetary policy, which can include allowing the currency to depreciate. In this case, the sentence implies that the Swiss National Bank is willing to see the Swiss franc weaken, which is consistent with a dovish stance.

This sentence does not contain strongly hawkish language (which would emphasize raising interest rates or tightening policy) or dovish language (which would emphasize lowering interest rates or easing policy). Instead, it suggests a neutral or balanced approach, where the Swiss National Bank is prepared to take action as needed to ensure appropriate monetary conditions.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual forecast of inflation without indicating any intention to change the monetary policy stance, suggesting a neutral tone."
}
```

The sentence simply presents a projection of inflation rates under a specific assumption about the three-month LIBOR rate, without expressing a clear intention to tighten (hawkish) or loosen (dovish) monetary policy. Therefore, I classify the monetary policy stance as neutral.
2025-04-15 01:18:03,020 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The downward revision of the inflation forecast suggests a more accommodative monetary policy stance, which is characteristic of a dovish stance."
}
```

The sentence implies that the economic situation is deteriorating and inflation expectations are decreasing, which typically leads to a more dovish monetary policy stance, potentially involving looser policy or lower interest rates to stimulate the economy.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that the current inflation forecast does not pose a threat to price stability, indicating a neutral stance as it neither signals a need for tightening nor easing monetary policy."

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The slight upward revision in inflation forecast is a minor adjustment, suggesting no significant change in the monetary policy stance."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because a slight upward revision in inflation forecast does not necessarily imply a significant shift in the monetary policy stance, and the sentence does not convey a clear hawkish or dovish tone.

The reasoning behind this classification is that a dovish stance is typically associated with a more accommodative or expansionary monetary policy, which could be used to address an overvalued currency.

This sentence can be classified as "dovish" because it emphasizes the low interest rate environment, which is a characteristic of an accommodative monetary policy stance. This suggests that the Swiss National Bank is likely to maintain or adopt a loose monetary policy, which is consistent with a dovish stance.

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply reports on recent trends in mortgage lending and property prices without suggesting any shift in the Swiss National Bank's monetary policy stance. There is no indication of inflationary pressures that would suggest a hawkish tone, nor is there any mention of economic weakness that would suggest a dovish tone. The sentence appears to be a neutral, factual observation.

## Step 1: Understand the sentence context
The sentence provided is: "risk premia are now minimal; indeed, on occasion they have fallen even further." This statement seems to indicate a positive or accommodative condition regarding risk premia, which are essentially the extra returns investors require for taking on additional risk.

## 2: Interpret the implications of risk premia being minimal or falling
When risk premia are minimal or decrease, it generally indicates that investors are less averse to risk or that the market perceives lower

{
  "label": "neutral",

I chose "neutral" because the sentence appears to be a factual, technical description of a specific aspect of the Swiss National Bank's monetary policy implementation, rather than a statement that suggests a tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) of policy. The sentence does not convey any clear implications for the direction of monetary policy, and therefore I classified it as "neutral".

This classification is based on the understanding that:

* Dovish: a monetary policy stance that is accommodative, expansionary, and focused on stimulating economic growth, often at the expense of slightly higher inflation.
* Hawkish: a monetary policy stance that prioritizes inflation control and is willing to raise interest rates to combat inflationary pressures.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence simply states a fact about a change in inflation prospects without indicating a tightening or loosening of monetary policy, hence it is neutral."
}
```

This sentence does not indicate a hawkish (concerned about inflation and potentially raising interest rates) or dovish (concerned about growth and potentially lowering interest rates) stance, but rather presents a factual observation about a change in inflation prospects. Therefore, it is classified as neutral.
2025-04-15 01:18:08,366 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The mention of a sharp recession suggests a need for accommodative monetary policy, implying a dovish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the understanding that a dovish monetary policy stance is typically associated with a focus on stimulating economic growth, which is often necessary during a recession. The sentence implies that the Swiss National Bank may need to take action to mitigate the recession, which is consistent with a dovish approach.
