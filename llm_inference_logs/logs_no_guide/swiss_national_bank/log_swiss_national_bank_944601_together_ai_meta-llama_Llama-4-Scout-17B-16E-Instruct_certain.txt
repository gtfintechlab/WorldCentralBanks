A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

2025-04-15 01:23:09,306 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a clear and specific reference to additional information, indicating a definitive and verifiable source."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it provides a clear and direct reference to a specific source of information (the attached instruction sheet), implying that the information can be verified and is not subject to interpretation or doubt.
2025-04-15 01:23:09,306 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains the phrase 'based on the assumption', indicating that the future value of the three-month libor rate is a prediction or hypothesis rather than a certainty."
}
```
2025-04-15 01:23:09,306 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains the phrase 'for the time being', which implies a temporary or conditional commitment, indicating uncertainty about future actions."
}
```

The sentence expresses a current intention, but the use of "for the time being" suggests that this intention may change in the future, making the statement uncertain.
2025-04-15 01:23:09,306 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific and definitive action taken by the Swiss National Bank, leaving no room for doubt or ambiguity."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it states a clear and specific fact about the SNB's decision, without any hedging or uncertainty.

This classification is based on the presence of a range of possible inflation values ("between 0.7 and 1.6") and a conditional statement ("assuming that..."), which suggest that the outcome is not guaranteed and there is some degree of uncertainty involved.

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents concrete information about specific economic indicators (growth in real estate prices and mortgage lending) without using words or phrases that suggest uncertainty, such as "may", "could", "likely", or "it is expected that". The language used is factual and descriptive, indicating a neutral, observational tone.

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it reports on a specific event that has happened, and the language used is factual and descriptive, without any ambiguity or uncertainty.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a past trend as a fact, without expressing any doubt or ambiguity."
}
```

The sentence "growth dynamism continued to wane" is a statement of fact and does not contain any words or phrases that indicate uncertainty, such as "may", "could", "likely", or "uncertain". The verb tense used also suggests that the waning of growth dynamism is a confirmed trend, which supports the classification as certain.

{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes specific actions that the Swiss National Bank will take, indicating a high degree of certainty about its future policy decisions."

This sentence is classified as "certain" because it uses definitive language, such as "it will increase liquidity substantially" and "engaging in additional repo operations", which implies a strong commitment to taking these actions.

Although the sentence mentions a condition ("if necessary"), the overall tone and language used convey a sense of determination and commitment, which suggests certainty. The uncertainty lies in the future state of inflation, but the action to be taken in response to it is clearly stated.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a possibility rather than a fact, indicated by the phrase 'there is a risk that'."
}
```

This sentence is classified as uncertain because it uses phrases that indicate doubt or possibility rather than certainty.
2025-04-15 01:23:30,007 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains the word 'likely', which indicates a degree of uncertainty about the future GDP growth."
}
```

The word "likely" suggests that the speaker is not entirely sure about the future development of GDP growth, but rather expresses a probability or expectation, which is a characteristic of uncertain statements.

However, upon re-reading, I realize that the sentence could be interpreted as uncertain because it describes a situation ("the recovery thus remains incomplete") without providing a clear indication of what the future holds or what exactly "incomplete" entails in terms of specific metrics or expectations.

A more nuanced view would consider the context of economic discussions, where "remains" could imply an ongoing assessment.

```

This sentence is classified as uncertain because it expresses a prediction or expectation about future events rather than stating a fact. The use of "expected" implies that there is some degree of uncertainty or unpredictability associated with the continuation of the growth momentum.

  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence uses phrases such as 'owing to' and 'have been stronger than expected' that imply a level of confidence and predictability, suggesting a certain outcome."

```

However, upon re-reading, I realize that the correct classification is uncertain because the sentence contains words like "will" and "sooner" which indicate a prediction or forecast rather than a statement of fact.
