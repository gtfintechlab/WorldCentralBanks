A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

2025-04-15 01:16:31,841 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze it step by step.

The sentence is: "this reflects the dampening effect of today's interest rate decision."

1. **Understanding the sentence**: The sentence refers to the impact or consequence of the Swiss National Bank's current interest rate decision, indicating that it is discussing an action taken (today's decision) and its effect.

2. **Determining if it's forward looking**: A statement is considered "forward looking" if it implies or discusses future events, conditions, or outcomes. The phrase "dampening effect" suggests a consequence that is likely to manifest over time, potentially into the future.
