A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

2025-04-14 17:17:41,637 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and context.

The sentence discusses "preliminary qualitative data derived from February's business perceptions report" and its implications on the performance of many businesses, specifically mentioning a relapse after a significant rebound between the end of the third quarter and early fourth quarter of 2020. The focus is on past events and data.

Given this, the sentence is describing past events or data without directly indicating future expectations or predictions regarding the Central Bank of Chile's monetary policy.

Therefore, the classification should be based on whether the sentence looks forward or discusses past or current situations.

Here's the output following the required structure

The sentence is: "based on this corridor, to ensure the convergence of inflation to the target within the policy horizon, in a few months the mpr had to stand between 275 and 325 basis points above its level prior to this meeting (2.75%)."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence is discussing a future condition or requirement ("in a few months the MPR had to stand between 275 and 325 basis points above its level prior to this meeting") relative to the current meeting, indicating it is discussing future implications or expectations.

2. **
2025-04-14 17:17:41,637 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and context.

The sentence discusses real wages, demand for workers, job postings index, companies' hiring expectations, and the sentiment among consumers and entrepreneurs. It describes the current state of these economic indicators.

Upon closer inspection, the sentence focuses on current or past conditions ("real wages continued to falter", "remained low", "persistent pessimism") rather than making a statement about future actions, expectations, or conditions that would indicate a forward-looking perspective.

Therefore, the classification is as follows:
