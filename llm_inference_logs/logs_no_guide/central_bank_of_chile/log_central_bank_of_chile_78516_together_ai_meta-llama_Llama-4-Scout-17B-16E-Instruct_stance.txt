A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a neutral observation about no significant change in bank arrears, which does not suggest a tightening or loosening of monetary policy."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply reports a factual observation about the stability of bank arrears without implying any change in the monetary policy stance. There is no indication of a more hawkish (concerned about inflation) or dovish (concerned about growth) tone.
2025-04-14 16:16:00,473 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance of the given sentence and provide a justification, let's analyze it step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the context of monetary policy stances
- "Hawkish" refers to a monetary policy stance that is likely to raise interest rates to combat inflation.
- "Dovish" refers to a stance that is likely to lower interest rates to stimulate the economy.
- "Neutral" refers to a stance that neither leans towards raising nor lowering interest rates.
- "Irrelevant" would imply the sentence does not provide information about the monetary policy stance.

## 2: Analyze the given sentence
2025-04-14 16:16:00,473 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence highlights a deterioration in real and financial variables, suggesting a potentially accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

I chose "dovish" because the sentence mentions a deterioration in various economic indicators, which could imply that the Central Bank of Chile might adopt a more accommodative or easing monetary policy stance to mitigate these negative effects. This tone is consistent with a dovish monetary policy stance.
2025-04-14 16:16:00,473 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that the market expects the monetary policy rate (MPR) to remain unchanged until May 2021, indicating a relaxed monetary policy stance."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "dovish" because it implies that the market expects the Central Bank of Chile to keep the policy rate low for an extended period, which is a dovish stance.
2025-04-14 16:16:00,473 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence is focused on gathering more information about the impact of COVID-related credit lines and does not express a clear stance on monetary policy, indicating a neutral tone."
}
```

The sentence does not indicate a hawkish (tightening) or dovish (loosening) stance, but rather a cautious and informative one, which is characteristic of a neutral monetary policy stance. The text does not seem irrelevant to monetary policy, as it discusses factors that could influence policy decisions.

I chose "neutral" because the sentence provides a factual description of the effects of a policy decision without indicating a bias towards tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) monetary policy. The tone is informative and objective, rather than advocating for a specific policy direction.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides factual information about the depreciation of the peso and its relation to external factors, without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply reports on market movements and does not suggest any specific action or tone from the Central Bank of Chile that would indicate a hawkish (more aggressive on inflation) or dovish (more accommodative on growth) stance.
2025-04-14 16:16:05,213 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a decision to keep the monetary policy rate (MPR) unchanged at 1.75%, indicating no change in the monetary policy stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence simply reports a decision to maintain the status quo, without any indication of a shift towards a more hawkish (tightening) or dovish (loosening) monetary policy stance. Therefore, the label "neutral" is assigned.

{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The board member voted for cutting interest rates, citing low inflation, weak growth indicators, and a weakening external scenario, indicating a preference for accommodative monetary policy."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the board member voted for cutting interest rates, which is an expansionary monetary policy move. The reasons cited, such as low inflation, weak growth indicators, and a weakening external scenario, also suggest a dovish stance, as they imply a desire to stimulate the economy through lower interest rates.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses potential risks and developments in the financial market without expressing a clear inclination towards tightening or loosening monetary policy."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence seems to be more informative and cautious, highlighting potential effects on interest rates without taking a clear stance on monetary policy. There is no indication of a hawkish (favoring higher interest rates) or dovish (favoring lower interest rates) tone.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence highlights high unemployment and inactivity, suggesting a weak labor market, which is a concern that could lead to a dovish monetary policy stance."
}
```

My reasoning is that the sentence presents economic data that suggests a need for accommodative monetary policy, which is characteristic of a dovish stance. The mention of high unemployment and rising inactivity implies that the economy may require stimulus, which is a concern that could lead the Central Bank of Chile to adopt a more dovish monetary policy.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a balanced assessment of inflation risks, downplaying the impact of higher oil prices, which indicates a neutral stance."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence does not suggest a strong concern about inflation (which would be hawkish) nor does it downplay inflation risks entirely (which would be dovish). Instead, it presents a balanced view, which is consistent with a neutral monetary policy stance.
2025-04-14 16:26:07,227 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence focuses on assessing the impact of external factors, such as the peso depreciation and the Chinese economy, without indicating a clear inclination towards tightening or loosening monetary policy."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence seems to be calling for a careful evaluation of certain economic factors, rather than expressing a clear bias towards a more hawkish (tightening) or dovish (loosening) monetary policy stance.
2025-04-14 16:26:07,227 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance of the given sentence and provide a justification, let's analyze the information provided:

The sentence mentions that "two years ahead, for the second month in a row the median of the economic expectations survey (ees) was above 3% annually, with 70% of the respondents pointing to a value above 3%." This information implies that economic expectations are high, which could suggest a concern about inflationary pressures.

## Step 1: Understanding the Implications of Economic Expectations
High economic expectations, specifically inflation expectations above a certain threshold (in this case, 3%), can indicate potential inflationary pressures. Central

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual update on inflation without expressing a clear direction for future policy, indicating a neutral stance."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply reports on the current state of inflation without suggesting that the Central Bank of Chile will tighten (hawkish) or loosen (dovish) its monetary policy. The mention of "still high pressures" is balanced by the observation of a limited fall in core inflation, which does not clearly lean towards a specific policy direction. Therefore, the sentence can be seen as neutral in terms
2025-04-14 16:26:08,881 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence does not provide any information about the Central Bank of Chile's monetary policy stance or actions."
}
```

I chose "irrelevant" because the sentence discusses the need for working capital among companies, which does not directly relate to the Central Bank's monetary policy decisions or stance. There is no mention of interest rates, inflation, or other indicators that would suggest a hawkish, dovish, or neutral monetary policy stance.
2025-04-14 16:26:08,881 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions a reduction of the monetary policy rate (MPR) based on progress in inflation convergence, indicating a loosening of monetary policy."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that a reduction of the monetary policy rate (MPR) is a dovish stance, as it implies that the Central Bank of Chile is willing to stimulate the economy by making borrowing cheaper.

{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a preference for a larger interest rate hike (150bp) to position the monetary policy rate near the upper edge of the corridor, indicating a more aggressive tightening stance."
}
```

This sentence indicates a hawkish stance because it advocates for a more decisive and larger interest rate increase, which is typically associated with a more aggressive approach to monetary policy tightening.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a willingness to make adjustments, but does not specify the direction or magnitude of those adjustments, indicating a neutral stance."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence suggests that the Central Bank of Chile is open to making changes to its measures, but does not provide any indication of whether those changes would be tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) monetary policy. The language used is cautious and conditional, indicating a neutral or data-dependent stance.

I chose "neutral" because the sentence provides a factual description of the economic context, mentioning cost pressures and supply difficulties, but does not suggest that the Central Bank of Chile will tighten (hawkish) or loosen (dovish) its monetary policy. The tone is informative and does not convey a clear policy bias.

{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a global economic situation without expressing a clear stance on monetary policy, nor does it imply a specific direction for interest rates or economic growth."

2025-04-14 16:26:29,962 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a balanced view of risks, implying no immediate inclination towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence implies that the speaker sees both risk scenarios as equally balanced, with no dominant factor pushing towards a more hawkish (tightening) or dovish (easing) stance.
2025-04-14 16:26:29,962 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that there were minimal changes to the central scenario projections, implying a lack of significant shift in monetary policy stance."
}
```

This sentence does not indicate a clear intention to tighten (hawkish) or loosen (dovish) monetary policy, but rather a stability in projections, which is consistent with a neutral stance.
2025-04-14 16:26:29,962 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a mixed view of credit conditions, with easing for large companies and tightening for mortgage lending, indicating no clear bias towards expansionary or contractionary monetary policy."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence describes a mixed situation with both easing and tightening of credit conditions, which does not suggest a clear hawkish (contractionary) or dovish (expansionary) stance. The sentence seems to be providing factual information about the state of credit markets rather than expressing a clear policy bias.
2025-04-14 16:26:29,962 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance of the given sentence and provide a justification, let's analyze it step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the context of monetary policy stances
- "Hawkish" refers to a monetary policy stance that is likely to raise interest rates to control inflation, indicating concern about inflationary pressures.
- "Dovish" refers to a stance that is likely to lower interest rates to stimulate the economy, indicating concern about economic growth and possibly low inflation.
- "Neutral" refers to a stance that neither leans towards tightening (raising rates) nor easing (lowering rates) monetary policy, often indicating
2025-04-14 16:26:29,962 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a global monetary policy stance characterized by low or decreasing policy rates, indicating an accommodative or loose monetary policy stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the description of policy rates being "held flat or further reduced" which implies a loosening of monetary policy, a characteristic of a dovish stance.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that the board members acknowledge the limitations of macroeconomic policies in addressing uncertainty, but also mention that policies can mitigate negative impacts, indicating a balanced and neutral stance."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence does not indicate a clear inclination towards tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) monetary policy, but rather a cautious and measured approach. The mention of mitigating negative impacts suggests some degree of accommodation, but the overall tone is balanced and does not suggest a strong bias towards either extreme.

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a concern about inflation, suggesting that the Central Bank of Chile may maintain a tight monetary policy stance to bring inflation expectations back down."
}
```

The sentence is classified as "hawkish" because it highlights a concern about inflation expectations remaining above a certain threshold, which is typically a concern for central banks that prioritize low inflation, and may lead to a more restrictive monetary policy stance.
2025-04-14 16:26:31,478 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence regarding the Central Bank of Chile's monetary policy meeting, let's analyze its content:

The sentence provided is: "in the labor market, job creation remained sluggish, with demand for workers still weak, consistent with the evolution of the economic cycle."

This statement describes a sluggish labor market with weak demand for workers, which typically suggests economic slowdown or weakness. 

Given this context:

- A "hawkish" stance would imply concerns about inflation and potentially tightening monetary policy, which doesn't align with the described economic weakness.
- A "dovish" stance would suggest a focus on economic growth and possibly
2025-04-14 16:26:31,478 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance of the given sentence and provide a justification, let's analyze it step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the context of monetary policy stances
- "Hawkish" refers to a monetary policy stance that is more inclined towards controlling inflation, often through increasing interest rates or reducing money supply.
- "Dovish" refers to a stance focused on economic growth and employment, often through lowering interest rates or increasing money supply.
- "Neutral" indicates a balanced or middle-ground approach, not strongly favoring either inflation control or economic growth stimulation.
- "Irrelevant" suggests the sentence does not provide

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions a 50 bp reduction, indicating an easing of monetary policy, which is a dovish stance."
}
```

The reasoning behind this classification is that a reduction in interest rates (in this case, 50 bp) is an expansionary monetary policy move, which is typically associated with a dovish stance. The mention of a "neutral bias" and the condition for the next move do not outweigh the dovishness of the rate cut. 

However, taking a closer look at the text again, a more accurate

{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that the central bank will act promptly to ensure inflation convergence, implying a concern about inflation and a willingness to take action to control it, which is a hawkish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the language used in the sentence, which emphasizes the need for prompt action to control inflation, indicating a focus on inflation fighting, which is characteristic of a hawkish monetary policy stance.

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies concern about persistently high inflation, which is a hawkish stance."
}
```

My reasoning is that the sentence highlights the persistence of high core inflation (between 10.5% and 11% for several months) and its upward surprises, which suggests that the speaker is concerned about inflationary pressures. This concern is typically associated with a hawkish monetary policy stance, which prioritizes controlling inflation over stimulating economic growth.

}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence mentions "expansionary bias" and options that involve either holding or reducing the monetary policy rate, which are indicative of a dovish monetary policy stance.

## Step 1: Understand the context of the sentence
The sentence discusses the focus on the appropriate time to start the process of withdrawal of monetary stimulus. This implies a consideration of when to tighten monetary policy, possibly by increasing interest rates or reducing quantitative easing.

## 2: Identify key phrases indicating monetary policy stance
The key phrase here is "withdrawal of the monetary stimulus." This phrase suggests a move towards less accommodative monetary policy, which is typically associated with a hawkish stance. A hawkish stance

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a concern about the limitations of monetary policy, but does not indicate a clear inclination towards tightening or loosening policy, hence it is classified as neutral."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence does not express a clear bias towards a more restrictive (hawkish) or more accommodative (dovish) monetary policy stance. Instead, it highlights the limitations of monetary policy in providing stimulus, which is a neutral observation. 

Let me know if you agree!

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a weakening credit supply and demand, which implies a potential easing of monetary policy, aligning with a dovish stance."
}
```

My reasoning is that a dovish monetary policy stance is associated with a more accommodative or expansionary policy, which is often signaled by concerns about economic weakness or downside risks. The sentence's mention of weakening credit supply and demand suggests that the economy may be experiencing difficulties, which could lead to a dovish policy response.

"the business perceptions report continued to show positive expectations for this year according to the bulk of opinions, especially towards the second half, beyond the disparity of businesses’ actual results."

This sentence discusses business perceptions and expectations but does not directly mention any monetary policy actions or stances (like interest rates, inflation targets, or economic growth concerns) that are typically associated with "hawkish," "dovish," or "neutral" classifications.

This sentence appears to be a neutral statement, as it does not convey any bias towards a more restrictive (hawkish) or more accommodative (dovish) monetary policy stance. The fact that the measures were in line with forecasts suggests a lack of surprise or deviation from expectations, which is consistent with a neutral stance.

I chose "neutral" because the sentence does not indicate a significant change in the monetary policy stance, but rather a specific adaptation of an existing measure. The action described seems to be a fine-tuning of a financial stability measure rather than a move that would be considered hawkish (tightening) or dovish (loosening).

2025-04-14 16:26:43,794 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the sentence regarding the Central Bank of Chile's monetary policy meeting and provide a justification, let's analyze it step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the context of the sentence
The sentence mentions "the evolution of both indicators had been lower than foreseen in the December report." This implies a comparison between expected and actual economic indicators.

## 2: Determine the implications of the indicators being lower than foreseen
Indicators being lower than expected often suggest that the economy might not be growing as strongly as anticipated or that inflation might be lower than expected. This can influence the central bank's decision on interest rates.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The decrease in private inflation expectations suggests a loosening of monetary policy, which is a dovish stance."
}
```

My reasoning is that a decrease in inflation expectations implies that the market is anticipating a more accommodative monetary policy, which is consistent with a dovish stance. This suggests that the Central Bank of Chile may be more likely to cut interest rates or maintain a loose monetary policy to support the economy.

  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that the Central Bank of Chile plans to reduce monetary stimulus gradually and cautiously, implying a tightening bias."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "hawkish" because it implies that the Central Bank is considering reducing monetary stimulus, which is a sign of a tightening monetary policy stance. The tone of the sentence, specifically the use of "reduce the monetary stimulus" and "gradually and cautiously", suggests a cautious approach to monetary policy normalization, which is consistent with a hawkish stance.

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence does not provide any information about the Central Bank of Chile's monetary policy stance or decisions."
}
```

I chose "irrelevant" because the sentence only mentions the price of a metal ( likely copper, given Chile's significant copper production) and does not contain any information related to interest rates, inflation, or other monetary policy indicators that could suggest a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance.
2025-04-14 16:26:46,266 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance based on the given sentence, we should consider what each term generally means in the context of central banking:

- **Hawkish** refers to a monetary policy stance that is more inclined towards controlling inflation, often through raising interest rates.
- **Dovish** refers to a stance focused on economic growth and employment, often through lowering interest rates.
- **Neutral** indicates a stance that is neither strongly hawkish nor dovish, possibly indicating no change in policy or a balanced approach.
- **Irrelevant** would suggest that the sentence does not convey any information related to monetary policy stance.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence simply reports a factual trend in housing loans without implying any change in monetary policy or expressing a clear stance."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence is descriptive and doesn't convey a clear direction or tone that would suggest a hawkish (tightening), dovish (loosening), or irrelevant (unrelated to monetary policy) stance.
2025-04-14 16:26:47,919 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence does not mention any monetary policy actions or statements that could indicate a stance on interest rates or economic growth."
}
```

I chose "irrelevant" because the sentence appears to be discussing economic trends and perceptions of investment in specific regions and sectors, but does not provide any information that would suggest a tightening or loosening of monetary policy, or a clear stance on the economy that would indicate a hawkish, dovish, or neutral view.
2025-04-14 16:26:47,919 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions that central banks had continued to raise their benchmark rates, indicating a tightening of monetary policy."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence mentions central banks raising their benchmark rates, which is a hawkish monetary policy stance. The mention of a "mixed outlook for monetary policy" does not change the fact that the action described is rate hikes, which is a clear indication of a hawkish stance.
2025-04-14 16:26:47,919 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that disinflationary pressures were more acute than expected, which could imply a more accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "dovish" because it implies that the Central Bank of Chile might be concerned about disinflationary pressures, which is a dovish signal. A dovish stance typically indicates a more accommodative monetary policy, which could involve lower interest rates or other measures to stimulate the economy.
2025-04-14 16:26:47,919 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance of the given sentence and provide a justification, let's analyze it step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the context of the sentence
The sentence mentions that "the consumer and business confidence indicators endorsed this scenario, standing in highly favorable territory." This implies a positive outlook on the economy.

## 2: Determine the implications of favorable confidence indicators
Favorable consumer and business confidence indicators typically suggest that the economy is performing well or is expected to perform well. This kind of economic condition can influence the central bank's decision on monetary policy.

## 3: Relate economic confidence to monetary policy stances
