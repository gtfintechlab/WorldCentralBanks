A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports historical data and facts, using specific numbers and clear causal relationships, indicating a tone of certainty."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents specific data (20% annual growth) and clear causal relationships (e.g., "driven by personal services", "reflecting the consolidation of eased sanitary restrictions"), which suggests a factual and certain tone. There are no words or phrases that indicate uncertainty, such as "likely", "may", or "could".
2025-04-14 16:26:57,705 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses doubts and potential concerns about the economic adjustment and inflation convergence, indicating uncertainty."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it contains phrases such as "some upward surprises", "spurred some concerns", and "implications for the convergence of inflation", which suggest a degree of uncertainty and ambiguity about the economic outlook.

```

  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a past event (the evolution of the macroeconomic scenario) without expressing doubt or ambiguity."
}
```

However, I can also argue that the sentence has some level of uncertainty due to the unpredictable nature of the COVID-19 pandemic. In that case, I would classify it as:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions the impact of unpredictable events (the spread of COVID-19 and containment measures) on the macroeconomic scenario."
}
```

2025-04-14 16:26:57,705 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes past events using the past perfect tense, indicating that the described situation is a historical fact."
}
```

The sentence describes a past situation using the past perfect tense ("had been permeating", "included"), which suggests that the events described are considered certain or factual. There is no language indicating uncertainty, possibility, or future prediction, which supports the classification as "certain".

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it describes a complex and dynamic situation with contrasting information (e.g., "above expectations" vs. "showed a deterioration"), which implies a degree of uncertainty about the future effects of the social crisis on the economy.
2025-04-14 16:26:59,151 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{

  "justification": "The sentence expresses a range of predictions and conditional expectations from different sources, indicating uncertainty about the timing of the MPR change."
}

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it presents multiple perspectives and potential outcomes (e.g., "not be raised any sooner than May 2021" and "rising by December that year"), which suggests that the future event is not certain.

The sentence is classified as "uncertain" because it uses hedging language, such as "somewhat", which suggests that the inflationary pressures are not extremely high, but rather moderately higher than expected. Additionally, the phrase "pointed to" implies that the data suggests or indicates, rather than directly states, that inflationary pressures are higher than expected.

The use of phrases such as "neither risk scenario was imminent" and "neither dominated over the other" suggests a degree of uncertainty and ambiguity.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses two possible options for the monetary policy meeting, indicating uncertainty about the specific course of action."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence presents two alternative scenarios (holding the MPR at 2.5% or reducing it by 25 bp), which implies that the outcome of the meeting is not predetermined, hence uncertain.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a clear necessity for action, indicating a definite need for intensive work to identify non-traditional measures."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it uses definitive language, such as "needed to be undertaken", which implies a sense of obligation or requirement, rather than uncertainty or possibility.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a nuanced view and discusses possibilities about the timing of monetary stimulus withdrawal, indicating uncertainty."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it discusses possibilities and variations in opinions about the timing of monetary stimulus withdrawal, rather than stating a clear, definitive fact.
2025-04-14 17:09:24,851 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses doubt about the capacity of monetary policy to continue providing an impulse of the same magnitude as in the past, indicating uncertainty."
}
```

This classification is based on the presence of words and phrases that indicate uncertainty, such as "it could hardly be thought" and "had the capacity", which suggest that the author is expressing doubt or uncertainty about the effectiveness of monetary policy.
2025-04-14 17:09:24,851 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a factual outcome of the bank lending survey, stating that credit supply and demand had 'generally continued to weaken' without expressing any doubt or ambiguity."
}
```
2025-04-14 17:09:24,851 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'probably' and 'in search of higher returns' that indicate a degree of uncertainty or speculation."
}
```

The presence of the word "probably" is a clear indicator of uncertainty, as it expresses a possibility rather than a fact. This suggests that the sentence is discussing a potential situation rather than a confirmed one, leading to the classification as "uncertain".

{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a prediction about a future event with a specific time frame ('until the first half of 2021'), implying some degree of uncertainty about the outcome."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because, although the sentence mentions a specific prediction about the benchmark rate remaining at 1.75%, it is a forecast about a future event, and the use of "anticipated" and "at least until" implies some degree of uncertainty about the outcome.
