A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

{

I classified the sentence as "forward looking" because it refers to the evolution of variables over time, specifically the future development of actual activity and potential growth, in addition to the dynamics of prices. This indicates that the sentence is discussing potential future changes rather than solely focusing on current or past data.

Note that the sentence mentions a historical event ("had added 50 bps") and does not express a future expectation or prediction, which is why it is classified as not forward looking.
