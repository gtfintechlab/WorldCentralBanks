A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

  "justification": "The sentence contains words and phrases with uncertain or predictive connotations, such as 'continued to anticipate' and 'worsening economic outlook', which indicate a level of uncertainty."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it expresses a prediction or anticipation of future events, rather than stating a fact with certainty. The language used suggests that the outcome is not guaranteed, but rather expected or forecasted based on current conditions.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a possibility or a consideration about the effect of a potential action, rather than stating a fact or a definitive outcome."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it discusses a potential consequence of raising the MPR (e.g., "would be unexpected and, consequently, confusing") and presents an argument against it, rather than stating a definitive fact or outcome.
2025-04-14 16:11:31,041 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports specific data and statistics without expressing doubt or ambiguity, indicating a certain tone."
}
```

The sentence provides concrete numbers and describes them in a neutral, factual manner, which suggests that the information being conveyed is presented as a fact rather than an opinion or uncertain prediction.
2025-04-14 16:11:31,041 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence uses definitive language, such as 'agreed', 'conclusive evidence', and 'had to be implemented', indicating a high degree of certainty about the need for a stronger monetary stimulus and the use of unconventional measures."
}
```
2025-04-14 16:11:31,041 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports on specific, factual data from a survey, indicating a clear and definitive condition."
}
```

The sentence is classified as "certain" because it presents concrete information about the bank lending survey's findings, using phrases like "tighter credit supply conditions" and "perceived weaker credit demand", which indicate a factual and definitive state.
2025-04-14 16:11:31,042 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a prediction about future economic impacts, using phrases like 'were going to linger on for quite some time', which implies uncertainty."
}
```

This sentence is classified as uncertain because it discusses future effects of economic shocks using language that implies a degree of unpredictability, rather than stating a fact with certainty.

2025-04-14 16:11:32,526 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a conditional view based on the board members' agreement, indicating some degree of uncertainty about the policy options."
}
```

I chose "uncertain" because the sentence mentions that the board members agreed on certain conditions, but the outcome or decision is not presented as a fait accompli, leaving room for interpretation and uncertainty about the final policy choice.
2025-04-14 16:11:32,526 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a conditional and speculative tone, indicating uncertainty about the outcome of a potential policy option."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it contains phrases such as "could also be valid" and "if...was considered", which suggest a hypothetical or conditional scenario, and a speculative tone regarding the potential effects of a policy option.
2025-04-14 16:11:32,526 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a specific and intentional action taken by the Central Bank of Chile, indicating a level of certainty about the bank's goals and future actions."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it describes a specific plan and intention of the Central Bank of Chile, using phrases such as "the need to inform the market", "would be attained with the publication", and "to prepare it for the adjustments that would occur shortly", which convey a sense of confidence and determination.
2025-04-14 16:11:32,526 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words and phrases with uncertain or vague meanings, such as 'most of the firms', 'remained stable or had declined slightly', and 'some businesses', which indicate a lack of absolute certainty."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it contains words and phrases that convey a degree of vagueness or imprecision, which makes the statement less than certain.

  "justification": "The sentence contains words and phrases that indicate uncertainty, such as 'below expectations', 'consistent with a recovery', and 'pointed to weaker activity', which suggest a degree of unpredictability or ambiguity."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it contains language that implies a degree of uncertainty or unpredictability, such as comparisons to expectations and indications of trends rather than definitive statements.
