A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence provided is: "the mixed signals coming from the labor market were also discussed."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence does not directly state a fact or a decision with absolute certainty. Instead, it mentions that "mixed signals" were discussed, which implies a level of ambiguity or uncertainty in the information or the discussion around the labor market.

2. **Justification**: The term "mixed signals" inherently suggests uncertainty or a lack of clear direction, indicating that the

The sentence is: "the data known since the publication of the december report pointed to somewhat higher than expected inflationary pressures."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence is stating a fact about past data and its indication regarding inflationary pressures. It does not express a future prediction or a subjective judgment that would inherently carry uncertainty. However, the use of "somewhat higher than expected" introduces a comparison to expectations, which are based on forecasts or predictions that inherently contain some level of uncertainty.

The sentence is: "in the profile of activity during the year, a somewhat stronger-than-expected fourth quarter had been observed, confirming the transitory nature of previous quarter’s slowdown."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence reports on an observed fact regarding the fourth quarter's performance being stronger than expected and its implication on the previous quarter's slowdown. The language used is factual and does not express doubt about the occurrence of the event but rather interprets its significance.

2. **Justification**: The sentence is considered "certain" because it states an observed fact and
2025-04-14 17:16:23,310 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and implications.

The sentence is: "discrepancies between the fed and market projections for the u.s. monetary policy continued to leave room for possible financial turmoil, as did the discussion around the u.s. government’s debt limit."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence discusses "possible financial turmoil" and refers to ongoing discussions around a significant issue (the U.S. government's debt limit), indicating a level of uncertainty about future outcomes.

2. **Justification**: The use of phrases like "possible financial turmoil" and the reference to ongoing discussions around significant issues directly imply uncertainty about
2025-04-14 17:16:23,310 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "regarding the former, it was clear that important progress was being made in this process."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence is asserting a fact about the clarity of progress in a process. The phrase "it was clear" indicates a level of confidence or certainty about the state of progress.

2. **Justification**: The use of "it was clear" suggests that there is no ambiguity or doubt about the progress being made, indicating a certain tone.

The sentence provided is: "in particular, it could depend not only on the dynamics of some relevant prices, but also on the evolution of actual activity and potential growth."

Let's break down the task:

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence contains the word "could," which is a conditional verb indicating possibility rather than certainty. It suggests that the outcome or the factor being discussed is not fixed or guaranteed, implying uncertainty.

2. **Justification**: The use of "could

The sentence is: "also, that other sources of information, delivered with lags, had still not shown such behavior, so it was necessary to wait for more data to become available."

1. **Understanding the Sentence**: The sentence implies that certain data or information is awaited because it has not yet been received or observed, indicating a lack of complete information at the moment.

2. **Analyzing Certainty**: The key phrases here are "had still not shown such behavior" and "it was necessary to wait for more data to become available." These phrases suggest that a

The sentence is: "thus, while the data on the number of dependent contributors of the pension fund system (afps) suggested that formal salaried employment was already nearing its pre-pandemic level, the data pointed to a milder rebound."

First, we observe that the sentence contains a contrast indicated by "while," suggesting a nuance or a difference between two pieces of information. The phrase "suggested that" is also noteworthy because it implies an interpretation rather than a fact. However, the main subject of the sentence is the data and its implications.

The sentence is a factual report about a past action taken by the Bank of England.

First, we observe that the sentence reports on a statement made by "one participant," which indicates it is conveying someone's observation or opinion rather than stating a fact directly attributed to the source of the information (presumably the Central Bank of Chile or its meeting minutes).

The phrase "noted the risks" suggests that the participant is highlighting potential negative consequences or uncertainties associated with the oil price rise. The fact that it is described

The sentence is: "this evolution owed mainly to the higher copper price, among other reasons."

1. **Understanding the sentence**: The sentence discusses the reason behind a certain "evolution," attributing it primarily to a higher copper price and mentions that there are other reasons as well.

2. **Analyzing certainty**:

2. **Analyzing the sentence**: The sentence mentions that the board "ruled" on certain "plausible options." The word "ruled" suggests a decision
2025-04-14 17:16:35,296 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and context.

The sentence is: "thus, the market internalized that the fed could go faster than previously expected, which pushed the long-term rates up."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence discusses a past event where the market adjusted its expectations regarding the Fed's actions, and this adjustment had a specific outcome on long-term rates. The key phrase "could go faster than previously expected" indicates a change in expectations rather than a certainty.

2. **Justification**: The use of "could go faster" introduces a degree of uncertainty because it refers to a potential future action that was
2025-04-14 17:16:35,296 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, "there was important news in the global scenario," we need to assess whether it conveys a sense of certainty or uncertainty regarding the context of the Central Bank of Chile's monetary policy meeting.

The sentence is somewhat vague as it doesn't directly relate to the Central Bank of Chile's actions or decisions but mentions "important news in the global scenario." The term "important news" could imply a significant event or development, but it doesn't specify what that news is or how it directly influences or is related to the Central Bank of Chile's monetary policy decisions.

However, the key to classification lies in understanding the nature of the statement

2025-04-14 17:16:36,987 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence discusses "preliminary qualitative data" from a specific report, indicating a "relapse in the latest performance of many businesses." The use of "preliminary" suggests that the data is not final, and the phrase "showed some relapse" indicates a negative trend but in a somewhat tentative manner due to the nature of the data.

However, the key aspect to determine the certainty or uncertainty of the statement lies in understanding the language used. The sentence reports on observed trends based on preliminary data without expressing a clear doubt about the occurrence of the relapse itself.
2025-04-14 17:16:36,987 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "although limited, activity and inflation brought some upward surprises which, coupled with the more positive tone of the external scenario, spurred some concerns about the speed of the economic adjustment and its implications for the convergence of inflation."

First, we observe the language used. The sentence contains phrases like "although limited," "some upward surprises," "more positive tone," and "some concerns." These phrases indicate a nuanced and cautious discussion rather than a definitive or assertive statement.

1. The presence of "although limited" and "some upward surprises" suggests that the

The sentence is: "accordingly, the median of the july economic expectations survey foresaw gdp growth in 2021 at 8.0% (7.0% in june)."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence reports a factual outcome from a survey without expressing doubt about the information. It states a specific figure (8.0%) that was forecasted by the median of the July economic expectations survey for GDP growth in 2021, comparing it to a previous figure (7.0% in June). The information is presented as a fact
2025-04-14 17:16:36,987 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and context.

The sentence is: "based on this corridor, to ensure the convergence of inflation to the target within the policy horizon, in a few months the mpr had to stand between 275 and 325 basis points above its level prior to this meeting (2.75%)."

First, we need to understand what the sentence is saying. It discusses the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) and its required position relative to its level before a specific meeting to achieve a certain economic goal (convergence of inflation to the target).

Now, let's analyze the certainty of the statement:

2025-04-14 17:16:36,987 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence discusses various economic indicators such as real wages, job postings index, companies' hiring expectations, and the sentiment among consumers and entrepreneurs. It states that real wages "continued to falter," the job postings index "was under its historical average," companies' hiring expectations "remained low," and there was "persistent pessimism" among consumers and entrepreneurs. These statements are factual observations about the state of the economy and are presented without ambiguity or speculation about future outcomes.

Given the information and the way it's presented, the classification can be determined as follows:
