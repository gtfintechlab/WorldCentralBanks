A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains the phrase 'among other reasons', which implies that there are additional factors that are not specified, making the statement uncertain."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence does not provide a complete and definitive explanation for the evolution, leaving room for other factors to have contributed to it.
2025-04-14 17:14:07,404 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains conditional phrases such as 'if necessary' and 'scale them up', indicating uncertainty about future actions."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "uncertain" because it implies that the future course of monetary policy is contingent on unspecified conditions, making it uncertain.
2025-04-14 17:14:07,404 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions 'among other factors' and does not provide a definitive statement, indicating uncertainty."
}
```

The sentence is classified as "uncertain" because it implies that there are multiple factors at play and does not provide a definitive or absolute statement about the relationship between the factors and the Central Bank of Chile's monetary policy meeting.
2025-04-14 17:14:07,404 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes contrasting trends and uses phrases like 'on the one hand' and 'on the other', indicating uncertainty and ambiguity."
}

  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence uses the phrase 'no big change', which implies a degree of ambiguity and uncertainty about the inflation expectations."

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because the phrase "no big change" is a vague statement that does not provide a clear indication of the inflation expectations, implying some degree of uncertainty.

This classification is based on the language used in the sentence, which suggests that the future is not entirely predictable and that there are factors that could affect the expected growth. The use of words like "uncertainty", "lower-than-expected", and "moderated" implies a degree of uncertainty, leading to the classification as "uncertain".

  "justification": "The sentence contains the phrase 'influenced by adjustments in monetary policy expectations', which implies a degree of unpredictability and uncertainty."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because the phrase "influenced by adjustments in monetary policy expectations" suggests that the outcome is dependent on various factors that may not be entirely predictable, introducing uncertainty.

{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a future prediction with conditional phrases, indicating uncertainty about the future trend of investment."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it uses phrases like "would be adjusting downwards" and "beyond the positive surprise", which indicate a prediction or expectation rather than a statement of fact. This suggests that the outcome is not certain, but rather subject to interpretation and potential change.

  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words and phrases that indicate uncertainty, such as 'could explain', 'was one of the first', and 'with prospects that', which suggest a degree of doubt or unpredictability."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it contains language that suggests a degree of uncertainty or unpredictability, such as "could explain", "was one of the first", and "with prospects that". These phrases indicate that the sentence is discussing possibilities or potentialities rather than stating facts with certainty.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific fact about the economic outlook and its impact on emerging economies without expressing any doubt or ambiguity."

```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents information in a factual and definitive manner, without using words or phrases that indicate uncertainty, such as "it is likely that," "it seems that," or "there is a possibility that." The language used is assertive and descriptive, suggesting that the information being conveyed is presented as a fact rather than an opinion or speculation.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses uncertainty due to the presence of risks that 'remained and had even varied on some fronts', indicating that the outcome is not entirely predictable."
}
```

This classification is based on the analysis of the sentence, which mentions that "risks remained and had even varied on some fronts", indicating that despite the agreement on the current state of the economy, there are still uncertainties and potential changes that could occur. This suggests that the outcome or future developments are not entirely certain.
