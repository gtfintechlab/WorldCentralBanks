A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

This sentence is discussing a change in inflation rate since the last meeting, which indicates it is reporting on past data or events.

To determine if it's forward looking or not, we need to assess whether it implies future actions, expectations, or conditions.

The given sentence is incomplete, but based on the available part, it seems to be discussing past inflation data.

Here's the classification:

2025-04-14 17:12:58,720 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and context.

The sentence discusses the Central Bank of Chile's observations regarding labor market dynamics, specifically mentioning "labor hoarding behavior" and the "evolution of the labor supply" influenced by factors like immigrant workers. Although it touches upon current or past observations ("had been more dynamic than estimated"), the discussion inherently involves understanding current conditions to possibly infer future economic or labor market trends.

However, upon closer inspection, the sentence is primarily explaining or analyzing current or past phenomena ("could be related," "had been more dynamic") rather than directly making a statement about future monetary policy or economic conditions.

The sentence is: "on the one hand, the 75bp option could give a feeling of continuity of the report’s central scenario which was not consistent with the observed changes and which, in a context where inflation expectations had risen, could be counterproductive."

First, we need to understand what "forward looking" means in this context. A statement is considered "forward looking" if it discusses future events, expectations, or intentions.

The given sentence discusses the potential impact of a "75bp option" (likely referring to a 75 basis point interest rate change) on

The sentence is: "in general, all sectors were performing in line with expectations, reflecting the heterogeneity that had been the trend in recent months."

This sentence discusses the current performance of various sectors in relation to expectations and notes a continuation of a recent trend. It does not explicitly or implicitly indicate future actions, decisions, or outlooks regarding the Central Bank of Chile's monetary policy.

Given this analysis, the classification should be based on whether the sentence looks forward or simply reports on the current or past state.
