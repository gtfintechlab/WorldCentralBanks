A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

2025-04-14 17:11:19,304 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "although limited, activity and inflation brought some upward surprises which, coupled with the more positive tone of the external scenario, spurred some concerns about the speed of the economic adjustment and its implications for the convergence of inflation."

First, we observe that the sentence discusses economic indicators and their implications, indicating a discussion about economic conditions and future prospects.

Key phrases to focus on for uncertainty are:
- "although limited" suggests a condition or a limitation, which can introduce a level of nuance or doubt.
- "some upward surprises" indicates unexpected positive changes,

The sentence is: "on the other hand, activity figures confirmed that the recovery had been faster than expected, even in some services that strongly depended on human interaction."

Let's break it down:

1. **Content Analysis**: The sentence discusses "activity figures" and their confirmation of a recovery being faster than expected. The use of "confirmed" indicates a level of certainty because it implies that there is evidence or data supporting the statement.

The sentence is: "the macroeconomic scenario continued to evolve driven by the spread of covid-19 and the containment measures needed to protect the populations’ health."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence discusses the evolution of the macroeconomic scenario in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken to mitigate its health impact. The use of "continued to evolve" indicates a change or development that is happening due to certain factors (spread of COVID-19 and containment measures), which suggests an element of unpredictability or ongoing adjustment rather than a fixed or certain outcome.

The sentence is: "these divergences had been permeating global financial markets, with opposing movements in interest rates and the depreciation of an important group of currencies, the chilean peso included."

First, we observe that the sentence reports on past events or conditions ("had been permeating", "depreciation") rather than making a prediction or expressing doubt about future events. The language used is descriptive and factual, indicating that certain divergences and their effects on financial markets, including the depreciation of currencies like the Chilean peso, have occurred.

The sentence discusses the considerations of several board members regarding the Central Bank of Chile's monetary policy, specifically the potential action of raising the MPR (Monetary Policy Rate) and its implications. The key elements to focus on are the language and tone used.

1. **Language and Tone Analysis**:

The sentence is: "first, a shift from a coordinated global cycle to one that could be quite unsynchronized, especially between china and the united states."

The key elements to consider are the words and phrases that indicate the level of certainty or uncertainty. The phrase "could be" is a significant indicator of uncertainty because it suggests a possibility rather than a definitive outcome.

The sentence discusses specific economic observations such as the deceleration of consumption, deterioration of its fundamentals, lower dynamism of private salaried employment, and a fall in consumer expectations. These observations are presented as factual developments without expressing a clear future prediction or ambiguity that would typically be associated with uncertainty.

However, upon closer inspection, the language used is descriptive and reports on past or ongoing trends ("had fallen since early in the year"), and it doesn't directly predict future actions or states with certainty. Still, the overall tone is more observational and factual rather than speculative.

The sentence discusses a risk related to the growth capacity of the world economy and questions the ability of monetary policy or other countercyclical measures to continue providing a significant impulse. The key phrases that indicate the tone and certainty level are "the risk that emerged" and "it could hardly be thought," which suggest a discussion around uncertainty or doubt regarding future economic growth and the effectiveness of monetary policies.

Given this analysis, the sentence is expressing uncertainty about the future capacity of monetary policy to drive economic growth.
