A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "furthermore, the tightening of financial conditions, the persistence of the negative supply shock and the worsening economic outlook continued to anticipate an erosion of investment dynamism."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence is discussing factors that are "continued to anticipate an erosion of investment dynamism," which implies a discussion about future expectations or outcomes based on current or past conditions.

2. **Justification**: The sentence is forward-looking because it mentions anticipating an "erosion of investment dynamism," indicating an expectation of future developments.

2025-04-14 16:14:58,319 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and implications.

The sentence is: "the importance of not losing sight of the fact that this reduction in activity, that should translate into a negative activity gap, was an unavoidable condition for the convergence of inflation to the target was emphasized."

First, we need to understand what "forward looking" means in the context of monetary policy discussions. Forward-looking statements typically refer to future expectations, predictions, or conditions that are anticipated to occur or be relevant in the future.

1. **Understanding the sentence**: The sentence mentions "the surge of new geopolitical risks, more difficult to evaluate or anticipate." This indicates a discussion about risks that are challenging to assess or foresee.

2. **Determining the focus**: The key elements here are "geopolitical risks" and the difficulty in "evaluating or anticipating" them. The mention of "anticipate" directly implies a consideration of future events or outcomes.

3. **Classifying the sentence**:

2025-04-14 16:15:48,296 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and context.

The sentence is: "in this context, long-term interest rates in developed economies had fallen across the board, risk premiums remained contained and volatility indexes, after a temporary rise, were back to mid-june levels."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence is describing past or current conditions rather than making a statement about future actions or expectations directly related to the Central Bank of Chile's future monetary policy decisions.

2. **Justification**: The sentence focuses on past observations of financial indicators without directly implying future actions or expectations regarding the Central Bank of Chile's monetary policy.

Given the
2025-04-14 16:15:48,296 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and implications.

The sentence is: "since the previous meeting, the price of most commodities had decreased, especially copper with a near 15% drop."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence discusses a past event or situation (the decrease in commodity prices since the previous meeting). It does not directly imply future actions or expectations regarding the Central Bank of Chile's monetary policy.

2. **Justification**: The sentence is describing a historical fact or a past trend without directly indicating future policy directions or expectations.

Given these observations, the classification should be as follows:
