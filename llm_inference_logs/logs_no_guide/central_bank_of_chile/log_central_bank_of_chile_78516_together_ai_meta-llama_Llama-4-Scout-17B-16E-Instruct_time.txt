A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses past growth and factors that have already occurred, such as the easing of sanitary restrictions and household support measures."
}
```

This sentence is not forward looking because it describes past events and their impact on the economy, without mentioning future expectations, projections, or plans.
2025-04-14 17:09:40,373 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses future implications and consequences, such as the speed of economic adjustment and inflation convergence, indicating a forward-looking perspective."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "forward looking" because it mentions potential future implications and consequences, such as the speed of economic adjustment and inflation convergence, which indicates a focus on future events or projections rather than past or current events.
2025-04-14 17:09:40,373 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{

2025-04-14 17:09:40,373 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a past situation without making predictions or projections about future events or economic conditions."
}
```

This sentence is not forward looking because it simply reports on the current state of the macroeconomic scenario driven by past events (the spread of COVID-19 and containment measures), without expressing expectations or projections about future economic conditions or policy actions.
2025-04-14 17:09:40,373 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence describes past events and does not contain any projections or statements about future economic conditions or policy actions."
}
```

This sentence is not forward looking because it uses the past tense to describe events that had been occurring, and it does not express any expectations or predictions about future developments.

I classified the sentence as "forward looking" because it implies a potential future development (increased risk-taking) as a consequence of past events (years of low rates). The phrase "in search of higher returns" and "after years of low rates" suggests a prospective outlook, indicating that the sentence is looking ahead to potential future outcomes.
