A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence provided is: "with regards to the absolute policy stance, he/she noted that low economic activity and reduced risk aversion open space for further easing, although the temporary increase in inflation could reduce this margin for a few months."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence discusses the potential for "further easing" in the context of current economic conditions and mentions a factor (temporary increase in inflation) that could affect this potential "for a few months." This indicates a discussion about future monetary policy actions based on current and anticipated economic conditions
2025-04-14 13:32:02,741 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and context.

The sentence is: "he/she added that the persistence of monthly inflation has been reduced to less than half the level of 2009, thus contributing to prevent expectations from being contaminated."

1. **Understanding the sentence**: The sentence discusses a past comparison of inflation rates and its effect on expectations. It implies that the current situation is better than in 2009 because the persistence of monthly inflation has decreased.

2. **Determining if it's forward looking**: Forward-looking statements typically involve discussions or implications about future events, conditions, or outcomes. The given sentence mentions "prevent expectations from
2025-04-14 13:32:02,741 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and implications regarding the Bank of Mexico's monetary policy meeting.

The sentence outlines several reasons provided by an individual (likely a policymaker or an analyst) justifying a potential decision or stance on Mexico's monetary policy. The key points include comparisons with the United States, the current state of Mexico's economy (e.g., the performance of the Mexican peso, inflation levels), and considerations for future monetary policy decisions.

Let's examine the sentence structure and content:

1. The sentence lists several reasons (i through vi) that justify a particular stance on monetary policy.
2. These reasons include current conditions
2025-04-14 13:32:02,741 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and implications.

The sentence is: "in this regard, he/she added that the direction of adjustments of the target rate is an even stronger signal than the level of the reference rate per se."

1. **Understanding the sentence**: The sentence discusses the significance of the direction of adjustments of the target interest rate in comparison to the level of the reference rate itself, as mentioned by an individual (likely a policymaker or someone related to the Bank of Mexico).

2. **Analyzing for forward-looking content**: Forward-looking statements typically provide information or hints about future actions, expectations, or conditions.
2025-04-14 13:32:02,741 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and implications.

The sentence is: "one member mentioned that, however, real wages in almost all advanced economies have started to register real negative variations, which anticipates future adjustments in private consumption."

1. **Understanding the Sentence**: The sentence discusses a current observation (real wages registering negative variations) and its anticipated impact on future private consumption.

2. **Classification**:
   - **Forward Looking**: A sentence is considered forward looking if it contains information or hints about future events, expectations, or decisions that have not yet occurred at the time of the statement.
   - **Not Forward Looking**:

The sentence is: "in view of the described environment, most members highlighted that central banks in advanced and emerging economies have eased their monetary policy stances."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence is discussing an action (easing monetary policy stances) that has already occurred, as indicated by the verb "have eased," which is in the present perfect tense, signifying a past action with a connection to the present. It does not directly express future intentions or expectations regarding the Bank of Mexico's monetary policy.

2025-04-14 13:32:04,689 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and implications.

The sentence discusses the Banco de México's approach to guiding its monetary policy actions. It mentions that the governing board follows the development of inflation in relation to its anticipated trajectory and considers various factors including the monetary policy stance, the horizon in which monetary policy operates, and medium- and long-term inflation expectations.

Key phrases that indicate forward-looking content include "anticipated trajectory," "horizon in which monetary policy operates," and "medium- and long-term inflation expectations." These phrases suggest that the sentence is concerned with future developments and expectations.

Given this analysis, the classification should reflect that
2025-04-14 13:32:04,689 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and context.

The sentence is: "as to the forecasts for non-core inflation, some members mentioned that, despite its recent decline, some of its components, particularly energy prices, are expected to exert upward pressure on this subindex in the following months."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence discusses forecasts and expectations for future inflation trends, specifically mentioning that certain components "are expected to exert upward pressure... in the following months." This indicates a discussion about future economic conditions.

2. **Justification**: The sentence is classified based on its reference to future expectations regarding inflation.

Given the analysis
2025-04-14 13:32:04,689 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and implications.

The sentence is: "most members stated that, in view of greater-than-anticipated inflationary shocks and an outlook for their effects lasting longer than anticipated, forecasts for headline and core inflation were revised upwards for the entire forecast horizon."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence discusses revisions to inflation forecasts for the "entire forecast horizon," indicating a discussion about future expectations or outlooks.
