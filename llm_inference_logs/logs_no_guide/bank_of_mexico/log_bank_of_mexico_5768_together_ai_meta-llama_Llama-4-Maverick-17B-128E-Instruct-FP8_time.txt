A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "second, he/she added that upwards risks to inflation have intensified and that the most important one stems from the proposed reform to banco de méxico’s law."

1. **Understanding the Sentence**: The sentence mentions "upwards risks to inflation have intensified" and links this intensification to a "proposed reform to Banco de México's law." This indicates a discussion about potential future impacts on inflation due to a specific event or policy change.

2. **Determining Forward-Looking Nature**: A statement

The sentence is: "he/she stated that, from the first increase to date, short-term inflation expectations have only increased, so that the intended objective of the supposed reinforcement of monetary policy seems to have had very low effectiveness."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence discusses the effectiveness of past monetary policy actions on inflation expectations. It implies a look at how past actions have influenced current expectations, which can be indicative of future policy considerations because it mentions "short-term inflation expectations."

The sentence provided is: "on the other hand, most members mentioned that core inflation exhibited slight reductions, laying at 3.65%, a pattern that one member emphasized has been observed since early 2018."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence discusses past observations and current states ("core inflation exhibited slight reductions," "laying at 3.65%," "has been observed since early 2018") without directly implying future actions or expectations regarding the Bank of Mexico's monetary policy.

2. **Justification**:
2025-04-14 13:26:34,301 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and context.

The sentence is: "one member added that capital flows to emerging economies had a divergent behavior by asset class, with outflows in fixed-income assets and historically high inflows in equity assets."

This sentence discusses past observations regarding capital flows to emerging economies, categorizing them by asset class. It does not explicitly or implicitly suggest future actions, expectations, or guidance related to the Bank of Mexico's monetary policy.

Given this analysis, the classification should be based on whether the sentence looks forward or reports on past or current conditions.

Here's the output based on the instructions:

The sentence is: "the majority noted that this behavior is in line with that observed in other emerging markets."

1. **Understanding the task**: We need to determine if the sentence is "forward looking" or "not forward looking" in the context of the Bank of Mexico's monetary policy meeting.

2. **Analyzing the sentence**: The sentence discusses an observation made by the majority regarding a certain behavior being in line with that observed in other emerging markets. It does not explicitly mention any future actions, expectations, or guidance related to monetary policy.
