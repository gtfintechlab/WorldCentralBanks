A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

2025-04-14 13:30:57,493 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and implications.

The sentence discusses the Bank of Mexico's potential monetary policy actions based on certain economic conditions and factors. It mentions that "low economic activity and reduced risk aversion open space for further easing," which indicates a potential direction for monetary policy. However, it also introduces a condition that "the temporary increase in inflation could reduce this margin for a few months," indicating a level of uncertainty regarding the extent or timing of such actions.

Given this analysis, the classification can be determined as follows:

2025-04-14 13:30:57,493 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "he/she added that the persistence of monthly inflation has been reduced to less than half the level of 2009, thus contributing to prevent expectations from being contaminated."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence reports a statement made by someone regarding the reduction of monthly inflation persistence and its effect on expectations. The statement is factual and reports on a specific, observable trend (reduction in inflation persistence) and its consequence. The language used is assertive and does not contain hedging or speculative elements that typically indicate uncertainty.

2. **Justification**: The sentence is
2025-04-14 13:30:57,493 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence outlines a person's argument in favor of a particular monetary policy stance by the Bank of Mexico, listing six reasons (i through vi) that support their viewpoint. The language used is assertive and presents a clear rationale based on various economic indicators and comparisons with other economies, particularly the United States.

Given the assertive tone and the presentation of specific, detailed reasons to support the argument, the overall tone of the sentence leans towards being definitive about the feasibility of the proposed monetary policy stance.

Therefore, the classification should be based on the certainty or uncertainty conveyed by the sentence
2025-04-14 13:30:57,493 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and implications.

The sentence is: "in this regard, he/she added that the direction of adjustments of the target rate is an even stronger signal than the level of the reference rate per se."

1. **Understanding the Sentence**: The sentence discusses the significance of the direction of adjustments of the target rate in comparison to the level of the reference rate. It implies a comparison or an analysis of monetary policy signals.

2. **Analyzing Certainty**: 
   - The sentence is a statement about someone's addition or commentary on the monetary policy.
   - It does not directly state a future
2025-04-14 13:30:57,493 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "one member mentioned that, however, real wages in almost all advanced economies have started to register real negative variations, which anticipates future adjustments in private consumption."

First, we observe that the sentence starts with "one member mentioned," indicating a report or quote from a specific individual during a discussion, likely within the context of the Bank of Mexico's monetary policy meeting. The use of "however" suggests a contrast or an alternative viewpoint being presented.

The statement then discusses a factual observation about real wages in advanced economies, noting they "have started to register real

2025-04-14 13:31:24,475 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence discusses various economic factors and their potential impacts on inflation, referencing specific data (e.g., the deflator for durable goods spending) and broader economic conditions (e.g., lack of flexibility in production, distortions in the labor market). The language used is analytical and refers to specific observations made by a member during a discussion, likely from the minutes of the Bank of Mexico's monetary policy meeting.

The key elements to consider for classification are the tone and the language used in the sentence. The sentence is descriptive and reports on observations and potential associations without expressing a clear, definitive

The sentence is: "another member noted that the negative output gap continues to be above 4% and is not expected to close before 2023."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence contains a projection or expectation about a future event ("is not expected to close before 2023"), which inherently involves uncertainty.

2. **Justification**: The use of "noted" and "is not expected" indicates a level of uncertainty or a forecast rather than a statement of fact.

Therefore, the classification is as follows:

2025-04-14 13:31:26,252 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence discusses a member's point about the necessity of ensuring that certain government actions and assumptions are consistent with the soundness of public finances. The language used is more suggestive of a precautionary or forward-looking statement rather than a definitive or factual one. The use of phrases like "it will be necessary" and the focus on future consistency with "soundness of public finances in the medium and long terms" indicate a level of deliberation or caution rather than a statement of fact.

Given this analysis, the sentence is more about a future condition or requirement that needs to be

The sentence is: "some members associated said resilience with the support from private consumption."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence implies that there is a discussion or an interpretation made by "some members" regarding the association between resilience and the support from private consumption. The use of "some members" and the reporting of their statement or opinion introduces a level of subjectivity and does not convey a definitive or universally accepted fact.

The sentence is: "most members considered that the balance of risks with regards to the expected path of inflation continues to be biased to the upside, in an environment of marked uncertainty."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence indicates a discussion about the balance of risks regarding inflation and mentions an "environment of marked uncertainty." The presence of "uncertainty" directly points towards a lack of certainty.

2. **Justification**: The phrase "in an environment of marked uncertainty" explicitly indicates that the situation is not certain, directly influencing the classification.

2025-04-14 13:31:26,252 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence discusses the Bank of Mexico's monetary policy meeting and the actions to be taken regarding inflation. The key elements to focus on for classification are the language and tone used, particularly whether they convey certainty or uncertainty.

The sentence states that "most members highlighted that in the foreseeable future all factors and elements that have an impact on both inflation and its outlook should be followed, and the necessary actions be taken..." This indicates a forward-looking statement with a conditional tone, as it involves future actions based on certain conditions (monitoring factors affecting inflation).

The sentence discusses the consideration of someone regarding the recent performance of economic activity. It mentions "limited available information" and "high uncertainty," which already hints at a level of doubt or uncertainty. Furthermore, it talks about "different indicators" showing a "smaller contraction, or even a slight recovery," which implies a range of possible outcomes rather than a definitive statement.

Given these observations, the sentence is characterized by its acknowledgment of uncertainty and the tentative nature of its conclusions.

The sentence provided is: "another member highlighted that the primary sector continued to grow."

Let's break down the task:

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence is stating a fact or an observation made by a member. The key verb here is "highlighted," which indicates that a statement was made, and the content of that statement is about the continued growth of the primary sector. The phrase "continued to grow" is a factual report on the state of the primary sector.

The sentence is: "nevertheless, indicators, consumption growth is expected to moderate somewhat towards the second half of the year."

First, we observe the use of the word "nevertheless," which often indicates a contrast or a shift in the direction of the discussion. However, the key elements to determine the certainty of the statement lie in the verbs and adverbs used.

The phrase "is expected to" is a clear indicator of a prediction or forecast rather than a statement of fact. This suggests that the information is not certain but rather based on current indicators or trends.
