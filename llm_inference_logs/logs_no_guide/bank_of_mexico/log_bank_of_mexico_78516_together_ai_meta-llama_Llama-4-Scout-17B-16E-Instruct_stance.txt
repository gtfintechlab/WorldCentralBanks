A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that there is space for further easing, indicating a preference for accommodative monetary policy, which is a dovish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the mention of "open space for further easing", which implies that the speaker is inclined towards loosening monetary policy, a characteristic of a dovish stance.
2025-04-14 13:27:36,287 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance of the given sentence and provide a justification, let's analyze it step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the context of the sentence
The sentence discusses the persistence of monthly inflation in relation to its level in 2009 and its impact on expectations. This context suggests a discussion about inflation trends and their implications for monetary policy.

## 2: Identify key elements of the sentence
The key elements are the reduction in the persistence of monthly inflation to less than half the level of 2009 and the contribution to preventing expectations from being contaminated (likely referring to inflation expectations).

## 3: Analyze the implications

2025-04-14 13:27:36,287 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance of the given sentence and provide a concise justification, let's analyze it step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the sentence context
The sentence discusses the direction of adjustments of the target rate being a stronger signal than the level of the reference rate itself. This implies a focus on changes in interest rates rather than their current level.

## 2: Interpret the implications of the sentence
Emphasizing the "direction of adjustments" suggests that the speaker is concerned about or is signaling future changes in monetary policy, specifically through the target rate. This could imply a willingness to adjust policy in response to economic conditions.
2025-04-14 13:27:36,287 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance of the given sentence and provide a justification, let's analyze it step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the context of monetary policy stances
- "Hawkish" refers to a monetary policy stance that is more inclined towards controlling inflation, often suggesting higher interest rates.
- "Dovish" refers to a stance that prioritizes economic growth and employment, often suggesting lower interest rates.
- "Neutral" indicates a balanced view that does not clearly lean towards tightening or easing monetary policy.
- "Irrelevant" would imply the sentence does not provide a clear stance on monetary policy.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence focuses on the process of monitoring inflation and does not indicate a bias towards tightening or loosening monetary policy, suggesting a neutral stance."
}
```

The sentence appears to be describing a data-dependent approach to monetary policy, where the central bank closely monitors various indicators to guide its decisions, without expressing a clear inclination towards more restrictive (hawkish) or more accommodative (dovish) policy. Therefore, I classify the monetary policy stance as neutral.

## Step 1: Understand the context of the sentence
The sentence discusses the shortage of inputs slowing down production in certain sectors during an early upward stage of the economic cycle. This context implies a focus on economic conditions and potential factors influencing the economy.

## 2: Identify key elements related to monetary policy
The sentence does not directly mention interest rates, inflation, or other common monetary policy tools. However, it implies that the economic cycle's stage and production issues could be relevant for policy considerations.

## 3: Determine the
2025-04-14 13:27:39,400 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence is neutral as it simply acknowledges the role of the pandemic in inflationary pressures without expressing a clear stance on monetary policy."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence does not indicate a clear direction or bias towards tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) monetary policy, but rather provides a factual observation about the pandemic's impact on inflation.
2025-04-14 13:27:39,400 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies that the central bank prioritized inflation control over economic growth by continuing to hike interest rates despite decreasing headline inflation."
}
```

The label "hawkish" is assigned because the sentence suggests that the Bank of Mexico maintained a tight monetary policy stance, prioritizing inflation control by continuing the hiking cycle even when headline inflation was decreasing. This indicates a focus on fighting inflation, which is characteristic of a hawkish monetary policy stance.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence simply reports a factual revision in the growth rate for the United States without expressing a clear stance on monetary policy."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence is a factual statement that doesn't convey a clear direction or tone regarding the Bank of Mexico's monetary policy, nor it implies a specific action or inclination towards tightening or loosening policy.

The sentence appears to discuss industrial production and civil engineering construction projects, but it does not provide any information related to the Bank of Mexico's monetary policy meeting or its stance, making it irrelevant to the task.

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply lists potential risks without expressing a clear inclination towards increasing (hawkish) or decreasing (dovish) interest rates, nor does it seem unrelated (irrelevant) to monetary policy discussions.

My reasoning is that the mention of "inflationary surprises" and "high degree of uncertainty" suggests that the speaker is vigilant about inflation risks, which is a typical concern of policymakers with a hawkish view.

1. **Understanding the Sentence**: The sentence mentions that one member pointed out that something (likely an economic indicator, possibly inflation or growth) has narrowed for two consecutive quarters.

2. **Monetary Policy Stance Definitions**:
   - **Hawkish**: Suggests a tightening of monetary policy, often due to concerns about inflation or the economy overheating.
   - **Dovish**: Implies a loosening of monetary policy, typically to stimulate economic growth or because inflation is not a concern.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence simply states a fact about the divergence in inflation and its expectations in advanced economies without expressing a clear stance on monetary policy."

I chose "neutral" because the sentence is more of a factual observation and does not convey a clear direction or bias towards tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) monetary policy.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates that the Bank of Mexico will maintain a prudent monetary policy stance and closely monitor various economic indicators, suggesting a cautious but not clearly hawkish or dovish approach."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence does not contain clear indications of a tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) of monetary policy, but rather a careful and data-dependent approach. The mention of "prudent monetary policy stance" and close monitoring of indicators suggests a neutral or balanced approach.
2025-04-14 13:27:42,748 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance and provide a justification, let's analyze the given sentence:

 Sentence: "the majority pointed out that in the federal forecasts for inflation and economic growth increased, as well as the expectations for the federal funds rate."

## Step 1: Understand the terms
- **Hawkish**: A monetary policy stance that is more inclined towards controlling inflation, often implying higher interest rates.
- **Dovish**: A stance that prioritizes economic growth and employment, often implying lower interest rates.
- **Neutral**: A balanced stance that neither leans heavily towards inflation control nor growth stimulation.
- **Irrelevant**: The information

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions several factors that suggest a concern about inflation, such as persistence of core inflation and inflation expectations not declining, which are typically associated with a hawkish monetary policy stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the factors mentioned in the sentence, which indicate a focus on inflation concerns and a potentially tight labor market, suggesting that the speaker may be inclined to consider tightening monetary policy, which is characteristic of a hawkish stance.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions a neutral indicator (stabilization of the labor participation rate) without expressing a clear inclination towards tightening or loosening monetary policy."
}

I classified the sentence as "neutral" because it simply mentions a neutral indicator (stabilization of the labor participation rate) without expressing a clear inclination towards tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) monetary policy. The sentence does not convey a sense of urgency or concern that would typically be associated with a hawkish or dovish stance.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence simply reports a factual observation about international financial markets without expressing a clear stance on monetary policy."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence is a factual statement that doesn't convey a clear direction or tone regarding monetary policy, neither suggesting a tightening (hawkish) nor an easing (dovish) of policy.
2025-04-14 13:27:44,158 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence highlights high levels of world inflation, which suggests a concern for inflationary pressures, typically associated with a hawkish monetary policy stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence mentions "high levels that world inflation has registered", which indicates a focus on inflationary concerns. This type of language is often used by central banks to signal a desire to control inflation, which is a key aspect of a hawkish monetary policy stance.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The mention of a continuing disinflationary process suggests that the Bank of Mexico may maintain an accommodative monetary policy stance, which is a dovish signal."
}
```

This sentence implies that the Bank of Mexico might keep interest rates low or take other expansionary measures to support the disinflationary process, which is characteristic of a dovish monetary policy stance.
2025-04-14 13:27:44,158 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence does not mention the Bank of Mexico's monetary policy or economic conditions in Mexico, making it irrelevant to the classification of the monetary policy stance."
}
```

The sentence appears to discuss global economic and political risks, specifically in the Eurozone, the US, Brazil, and the UK, but does not provide any information about the Bank of Mexico's monetary policy meeting or its stance, leading to the classification as "irrelevant".

{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The statement implies that the current domestic monetary policy is restrictive and suggests that it may need to be adjusted, indicating a more accommodative or dovish stance."
}
```

The reasoning behind this classification is that the sentence highlights the restrictiveness of the domestic monetary policy and implies that it may be necessary to reassess this stance given the economic conditions, which is a dovish signal.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that a downward adjustment in the interest rate differential between Mexico and the US is expected, implying a potential easing of monetary policy, which is a dovish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the expectation of a downward adjustment in the interest rate differential, which implies that the Bank of Mexico might lower interest rates to align with market expectations, indicating a dovish monetary policy stance.

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The statement implies that further monetary policy easing may not be effective, suggesting a cautious or restrictive stance, which is characteristic of a hawkish tone."
}
```

This classification is based on the idea that a hawkish stance is associated with a cautious approach to monetary policy easing, and the sentence suggests that the speaker is skeptical about the effectiveness of further easing, which aligns with a hawkish view.

{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The mention of decreased risk of potential losses for banks and brokerage firms due to interest rate increases suggests a more accommodative monetary policy stance, which is characteristic of a dovish tone."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "dovish" because it implies that the member is concerned about the potential negative impacts of interest rate increases on financial institutions, which is a dovish concern. This suggests that the member may be inclined to support more gradual or limited interest rate increases, or even no increases at all, which is a dovish

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that the exchange rate shock may be temporary or moderate, implying a potentially less severe policy response, which is a dovish stance."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "dovish" because it implies that the speaker is open to the possibility that the exchange rate shock may not be as severe or long-lasting as others think, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance. This is a dovish view, as it suggests that the speaker is willing to consider a more relaxed policy response to economic shocks

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The mention of global inflationary pressures continuing to affect headline and core inflation suggests a concern for inflation, which is typically associated with a hawkish monetary policy stance."
}
```

In this classification, I chose "hawkish" because the sentence implies that the Bank of Mexico is vigilant about inflationary pressures, which is a characteristic of a hawkish stance. A hawkish stance typically involves prioritizing inflation control, which may lead to tighter monetary policy.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides information about US GDP growth forecasts without expressing a clear stance on monetary policy, making it neutral."

```

This sentence does not express a clear opinion on interest rates or monetary policy, but rather provides information about economic growth forecasts. Therefore, it is classified as neutral.
2025-04-14 13:28:01,331 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence acknowledges various factors influencing inflation but does not express a clear inclination towards tightening or loosening monetary policy."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence presents a balanced view of the factors affecting inflation, including economic deceleration, supply shocks, and uncertainty, without emphasizing the need for immediate action or a specific policy stance, which is characteristic of a neutral tone.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a potential recovery in economic activity and implies that the current situation is fragile, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "dovish" because it highlights the possibility of a recovery, but also emphasizes the uncertainty and fragility of the current situation, which could lead to a more supportive monetary policy stance. This type of language is typically associated with a dovish tone, which is concerned with promoting economic growth and stability.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence simply states a fact about market behavior without expressing a clear stance on monetary policy, indicating a neutral tone."

I chose "neutral" because the sentence does not convey a clear direction or bias towards tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) monetary policy, nor does it seem unrelated to monetary policy (irrelevant). The tone appears to be informative and observational, rather than advocating for a specific policy action.

My reasoning is that the statement seems to be warning against using international reserves for public spending, implying that such actions may not be desirable or sustainable. This cautionary tone is consistent with a hawkish monetary policy stance, which tends to prioritize inflation control and fiscal discipline over stimulating economic growth.
2025-04-14 13:28:02,843 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance of the given sentence and provide a justification, let's analyze it step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the context of the sentence
The sentence discusses the availability of close substitutes for certain economic inputs and the high price elasticity of demand for these inputs. This implies that economic agents can easily switch to alternative inputs if prices change.

## 2: Determine the implications for monetary policy
The discussion about substitutability and price elasticity of demand hints at the flexibility of economic agents in response to price changes. However, it does not directly mention interest rates, inflation targets, or money supply, which are typical indicators

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence is a neutral observation about the primary sector's growth and does not convey a clear stance on monetary policy."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply reports on a specific sector's growth without expressing a view on inflation, interest rates, or other monetary policy issues that would indicate a hawkish, dovish, or clearly irrelevant stance.
2025-04-14 13:28:04,323 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions a moderation in consumption growth, but does not provide a clear indication of a tightening or loosening of monetary policy, hence a neutral stance."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence provides a relatively balanced view of the economic outlook without suggesting a significant change in the monetary policy stance. The mention of moderation in consumption growth does not strongly lean towards a hawkish (concerned about inflation, potentially leading to rate hikes) or dovish (concerned about economic growth, potentially leading to rate cuts) stance
2025-04-14 13:28:04,323 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates a decision to lower the target for the overnight interbank rate, which is an expansionary monetary policy move."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that a dovish monetary policy stance is characterized by a tendency to prioritize economic growth and lower inflation targets through expansionary monetary policies, such as lowering interest rates. In this case, the decision to lower the target for the overnight interbank rate by 25 basis points is a clear example of a dovish policy move.

I chose "neutral" because the sentence discusses potential factors that could lead to a contraction, but does not indicate a specific policy stance or bias towards more aggressive action (hawkish) or more accommodative action (dovish). The tone is more analytical and cautious, rather than advocating for a particular policy direction.

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply states a fact about energy prices without indicating a desire to tighten (hawkish) or loosen (dovish) monetary policy. The sentence does not provide enough information to classify it as hawkish or dovish, and it is relevant to the discussion of monetary policy, so it is not irrelevant.

2025-04-14 13:28:11,971 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance of the given sentence and provide a concise justification, let's analyze it step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the context of monetary policy stances
- "Hawkish" refers to a monetary policy stance that is focused on controlling inflation, often implying higher interest rates or a reduction in the money supply.
- "Dovish" refers to a stance that prioritizes economic growth and employment, often implying lower interest rates or an increase in the money supply.
- "Neutral" indicates a balanced approach, neither strongly favoring inflation control nor economic growth.
- "Irrelevant" suggests the statement does

}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence does not indicate a clear inclination towards tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) monetary policy, but rather presents a factual assessment of the energy price situation. The tone is informative and objective, without expressing a clear bias towards a specific policy action. 

Alternatively, one could argue that the sentence has a slightly dovish tone, as

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply states a fact about maritime transport costs and commodity scarcity without expressing a view on inflation, interest rates, or other monetary policy issues that would suggest a hawkish, dovish, or clearly directional stance. The sentence seems to be providing context or background information rather than advocating for a specific policy action.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions uncertainty and an adverse sociopolitical environment, but does not explicitly suggest a change in the monetary policy stance, indicating a neutral tone."

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence does not express a clear stance on monetary policy, instead discussing general economic factors and structural changes."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence appears to be a factual statement about economic trends and does not convey a clear opinion or direction on monetary policy that would lean towards being hawkish (favoring tighter monetary policy) or dovish (favoring looser monetary policy). The sentence seems irrelevant to a direct discussion of monetary policy stance but given the options, "neutral" seems the most appropriate as it doesn't directly advocate for

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that interest rate cuts are expected in the second half of 2023, implying a loosening of monetary policy, which is a dovish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the idea that a dovish monetary policy stance is associated with a more accommodative or expansionary policy, often involving lower interest rates. The sentence implies that the Bank of Mexico's policy is expected to become more accommodative in the future, which is consistent with a dovish stance.

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence does not mention monetary policy, interest rates, or economic indicators, making it unrelated to the Bank of Mexico's monetary policy meeting."
}

The sentence appears to discuss a company's structural problems and the need for a credible business plan, which is unrelated to monetary policy. Therefore, I classified it as "irrelevant".

}
```

In this sentence, the speaker highlights the contribution of monetary policy to the performance of the Mexican peso in a context of tight global monetary conditions, which suggests a cautious or restrictive approach to monetary policy, characteristic of a hawkish stance.

## Step 1: Understand the Context
The sentence discusses a component that declined during the first seven months of the year but showed an upward trend in the last four months. This information is related to economic data that could influence monetary policy decisions.

## 2: Identify Key Elements
The key elements here are the decline and the subsequent upward trend of a specific economic component. However, the sentence does not directly mention what this component is or how it relates to inflation, economic growth, or other factors that typically influence monetary policy st
2025-04-14 13:28:22,202 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual observation about breakeven inflation rates without expressing a clear stance on monetary policy, indicating a neutral tone."
}
```

The sentence simply reports on the state of breakeven inflation rates without indicating a desire to change or maintain the current monetary policy stance, which suggests a neutral classification.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence describes general economic trends and their effects on various markets without expressing a clear stance on monetary policy, indicating a neutral tone."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply reports on the consequences of certain economic developments without suggesting that the Bank of Mexico will tighten (hawkish) or loosen (dovish) its monetary policy. The sentence's focus on describing general economic trends and their effects on various markets, without expressing a clear stance on monetary policy, supports this classification. 

Alternatively, one might argue that this sentence has

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that the slowdown of global economic activity has reduced expectations of a faster reduction of monetary stimulus, implying a more accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "dovish" because it implies that the reduction of monetary stimulus may be slower than previously expected, which is a more accommodative or dovish stance.

"label": "neutral",
"justification": "The sentence is neutral as it simply states a fact about the differences in recovery being associated with implemented policies without expressing a clear direction or bias towards tightening or loosening monetary policy."
