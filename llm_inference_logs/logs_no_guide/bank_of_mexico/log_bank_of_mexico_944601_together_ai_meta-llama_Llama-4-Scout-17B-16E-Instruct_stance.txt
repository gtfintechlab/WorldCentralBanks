A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a concern for downside risks to global economic growth, which typically leads to a more accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

The sentence implies that the speaker is concerned about the potential for economic downturn, which is a dovish signal. This concern for downside risks could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy, which is characteristic of a dovish stance.
2025-04-14 13:33:09,790 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance of the given sentence and provide a concise justification, let's analyze the content:

The sentence discusses factors that could influence inflation, such as the lack of flexibility in production, distortions in the labor market, and their potential effects on inflation and risk perception. It does not directly express a clear stance on monetary policy (like raising, lowering, or keeping interest rates steady) but mentions factors that could pressure inflation.

Given that it mentions potential inflationary pressures (e.g., "have pressured inflation", "the lack of flexibility in production of goods and the unprecedented distortions in the labor market that have led to lower availability of

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence does not express a clear stance on monetary policy, instead discussing a potential economic benefit of trade tensions between China and the US for Mexico."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence does not imply any specific action or inclination towards tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) monetary policy, nor does it seem entirely unrelated (irrelevant) to economic conditions that could influence policy decisions.
2025-04-14 13:33:09,790 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The statement implies a reduced need for monetary restriction, suggesting a more accommodative stance, which is characteristic of dovish monetary policy."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "dovish" because it suggests that the shocks and risks have mitigated, implying that the current level of monetary restriction may not be necessary going forward, which is a dovish signal.
2025-04-14 13:33:09,790 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides factual information about capital inflows without expressing a clear stance on monetary policy, thus indicating a neutral tone."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply reports on the state of capital inflows from foreign investors without expressing a view that would suggest a tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) of monetary policy. The information provided is more informative than directive, which aligns with a neutral classification.

The sentence mentions that the number of shocks increased during the second half of the year, mainly due to supply effects that are not permanent. This implies an acknowledgment of temporary supply-side shocks.

## 2: Interpret the Implications
The mention of supply effects that are not permanent suggests that these shocks are seen as transitory rather than long-term or structural issues. This kind of characterization can influence monetary policy decisions, as central banks often look through temporary supply shocks when setting policy, especially if

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The statement indicates that the current monetary policy is consistent with the inflation target and decides to maintain the interest rate, showing no inclination towards tightening or loosening policy."

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence mentions maintaining the current interest rate target, which implies no change in the monetary policy stance. The tone is not restrictive (hawkish) or accommodative (dovish), but rather neutral, as it aims to keep inflation in line with the target.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence acknowledges progress in disinflation but also highlights uncertainty and risks, suggesting a balanced tone without a clear inclination towards tightening or easing."

```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence strikes a balance between noting positive developments (disinflationary progress) and cautioning about ongoing uncertainty and risks, without expressing a clear bias towards a more hawkish (tightening) or dovish (easing) stance.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The mention of downward adjustments in the yield curve of treasury bonds implies a loosening of monetary policy, which is a dovish stance."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "dovish" because a downward adjustment in the yield curve typically implies a decrease in interest rates, which is a monetary policy easing, and this is a characteristic of a dovish stance.

I chose "neutral" because the sentence implies that the members are not seeing significant changes in the economy, which suggests that they are not advocating for a tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) of monetary policy. The tone is observational and cautious, rather than advocating for a specific policy action.

{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a desire for more timely data, which is a neutral and practical concern rather than a clear indication of a hawkish or dovish stance."

I chose "neutral" because the sentence does not express a clear opinion on the direction of monetary policy or the economy, but rather a desire for more information to make informed decisions. This suggests a cautious and data-dependent approach, which is consistent with a neutral monetary policy stance.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence highlights risks but does not express a clear inclination towards tightening or loosening monetary policy."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply lists potential risks without indicating a specific policy stance or bias towards inflation, growth, or interest rates. The tone is cautionary but does not lean towards advocating for a more restrictive (hawkish) or accommodative (dovish) monetary policy.

This sentence does not express a clear direction or bias towards tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) monetary policy, nor does it provide insight into the Bank of Mexico's own policy stance. It merely states a fact about other central banks' actions, which suggests a neutral classification.

I chose "neutral" because the sentence implies that the speaker wants to assess the scenarios and challenges before making any adjustments to the monetary policy stance, which does not indicate a clear bias towards a more hawkish (tightening) or dovish (loosening) stance.

{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence only mentions a factual observation about domestic gas prices without expressing a clear stance on monetary policy."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply states a fact about gas prices without implying any specific action or direction for monetary policy, which would be characteristic of a hawkish (more aggressive tightening) or dovish (more accommodative) stance.

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies concerns about inflation, suggesting a cautious or tightening stance, which is characteristic of a hawkish monetary policy view."
}
```

The sentence expresses concern about the "price formation process" and "inflation expectations", which indicates that the speaker is vigilant about inflationary pressures. This concern is typically associated with a hawkish stance, which prioritizes controlling inflation over stimulating economic growth.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions an observation about interest rates without expressing a clear intention to change or maintain them, indicating a neutral stance."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply notes a fact about interest rates without expressing a clear opinion or intention to tighten (hawkish) or loosen (dovish) monetary policy. The mention of "idiosyncratic factors" also suggests a neutral, observational tone rather than a value judgment that would imply a hawkish or dovish stance.

{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The mention of a negative output gap and its persistence until 2023 suggests a concern for economic growth, which is typically associated with a dovish stance."
}
```

This sentence implies that the speaker is concerned about the economic growth and the output gap, which is a characteristic of a dovish monetary policy stance. A dovish stance tends to prioritize economic growth and employment over inflation concerns, often leading to more accommodative monetary policies.

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply reports on economic data (gross fixed investment rebounding in January and declining in February) without expressing a view on inflation, interest rates, or other aspects of monetary policy that would indicate a hawkish, dovish, or clearly directional stance. The information provided is more observational than directive or suggestive of a specific policy action, aligning with a neutral classification.

The sentence mentions that "the persistence of monthly inflation has been reduced to less than half the level of 2009, thus contributing to prevent expectations from being contaminated." This statement implies a positive development regarding inflation, suggesting that the current situation is improving compared to a previous period (2009). The focus on reduced inflation persistence and its implications for expectations indicates a cautiously optimistic view on inflationary trends.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence highlights economic obstacles in Mexico but does not express a clear stance on monetary policy, making it neutral."

I chose "neutral" because the sentence focuses on identifying economic challenges in Mexico, such as governance problems and uncertainty in domestic economic conditions, without expressing a clear opinion on the direction of monetary policy or suggesting specific actions regarding interest rates or economic stimulus. This makes the statement more observational and less indicative of a hawkish (favoring tighter monetary policy) or dovish (favoring looser monetary policy) stance.

## Step 1: Understand the context of the sentence
The sentence mentions "the core component" showing "persistence," which likely refers to inflation or another economic indicator being discussed in the context of the Bank of Mexico's monetary policy meeting.

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",

I classified the sentence as "hawkish" because it implies that the Bank of Mexico is expecting a tightening in credit conditions, which is a sign of a more restrictive monetary policy stance. This is consistent with a hawkish tone, which is associated with a focus on inflation control and potentially higher interest rates.

2025-04-14 13:33:32,468 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance of the given sentence and provide a justification, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Understanding the Sentence**: The sentence discusses the effect of interest rate increases on inflation expectations and the real interest rate. It mentions that these increases led to the expectation of more permanent inflation, which did not affect the real interest rate.

2. **Defining Monetary Policy Stances**:
   - **Hawkish**: A stance that is more concerned with inflation and tends to favor raising interest rates to control it.
   - **Dovish**: A stance that prioritizes economic growth and employment over inflation, often favoring

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a concern for low demand and a potential need for accommodative policy, suggesting a dovish stance."
}
```

My reasoning is that the sentence highlights weak demand and low storage capacity, which could be seen as factors that might require a more accommodative monetary policy stance, which is characteristic of a dovish tone. There is no mention of inflation concerns or a need to tighten policy, which would be more consistent with a hawkish stance. The neutral label does not fit as the sentence has a clear implication for policy

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions risks to the global economy but does not explicitly indicate a tightening or loosening of monetary policy, suggesting a neutral stance."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence highlights risks and mentions "tighter monetary and financial conditions" as an external factor, but does not express a clear intention to change the monetary policy stance, which would be characteristic of a hawkish or dovish tone.

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence does not mention monetary policy or economic indicators that would influence the Bank of Mexico's policy stance."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "irrelevant" because it discusses fiscal policy (tax increases) rather than monetary policy, and does not provide any insight into the Bank of Mexico's policy stance.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions a potential risk but does not express a clear direction for monetary policy, nor does it imply a change in the stance."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply mentions a potential complication without expressing a view on interest rates or the economy that would suggest a hawkish (favoring higher interest rates) or dovish (favoring lower interest rates) stance. The mention of a risk does not inherently lean towards tightening or easing policy, hence the classification as neutral.
2025-04-14 13:33:34,111 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Based on the given sentence, here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence highlights weak economic activity in the euro area and declining industrial production and investment in China, suggesting a potentially accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

The sentence mentions weak economic indicators, which could lead to a dovish monetary policy stance, as it might imply a need for stimulus or supportive measures to boost economic activity.

I chose "dovish" because the sentence implies that the economy may be slowing down, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy, a characteristic of a dovish stance.

## Step 1: Understand the Sentence
The sentence provided is quite neutral and does not directly indicate any change or specific direction in monetary policy. It simply states an observation about something being consistent across all categories.

## 2: Define Monetary Policy Stances
- **Hawkish**: Indicates a preference for tighter monetary policy, possibly to control inflation, which might involve raising interest rates.
- **Dovish**: Suggests a preference for looser monetary policy, possibly to stimulate the economy

The sentence implies that despite potential volatility due to the country's elections, the market expects the peso's foreign exchange rate to stabilize and return to previous levels in the medium to long term. This suggests an expectation of stability in macroeconomic conditions.

Given this analysis, the stance seems to lean towards not anticipating significant negative impacts on the economy or inflation that would necessitate a tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) of monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a view that current conditions will persist, which doesn't strongly advocate for a

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that the slowdown of global economic activity has reduced expectations of a faster reduction of monetary stimulus, implying a more accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

This sentence implies a dovish stance because it suggests that the reduction of monetary stimulus might be slower than previously expected, which is a more accommodative policy stance.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence simply states facts about inflation trends and does not express a clear stance on monetary policy."
}
```

The sentence is neutral because it only mentions the causes of the inflation trend without implying any specific action or direction for monetary policy, which is a characteristic of a neutral stance.
2025-04-14 13:33:52,072 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that continuing to signal a downward cycle may be too risky, implying a cautious approach to easing monetary policy and potentially limiting further rate cuts."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "hawkish" because it implies a concern about the potential risks of further monetary policy easing, which is a characteristic of a hawkish stance. This suggests that the speaker is cautious about loosening policy too much and may be inclined to keep interest rates higher than they would in a dovish scenario.

## Step 1: Understand the Sentence
The sentence provided is: "they mentioned that this upward adjustment was due to the rise continued decreasing." This sentence seems to imply a change in economic indicators that could influence monetary policy decisions.

## 2: Identify Key Elements
The key elements here are "upward adjustment" and "continued decreasing." An upward adjustment typically suggests an increase, possibly in interest rates or economic indicators. However, the phrase "continued decreasing" seems to indicate a trend of reduction or easing, which could imply

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies that the monetary policy tightening had little effect on inflation expectations, suggesting a more accommodative or cautious stance."
}
```

The sentence is classified as "dovish" because it questions the effectiveness of monetary policy tightening, which is a dovish perspective. The tone of the sentence suggests that the speaker is concerned about the limited impact of policy actions, which is consistent with a dovish stance.

{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that the Bank of Mexico does not see a wage-price spiral, which implies that there is no strong argument for tightening or loosening monetary policy, indicating a neutral stance."
}
```

The sentence does not indicate a clear direction towards tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) monetary policy, and it is related to the Bank of Mexico's monetary policy, so it is not "irrelevant". The tone is more informative and factual, suggesting that the current situation does not call for a specific policy action, which

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",

I chose "hawkish" because the sentence implies that the speaker is concerned about inflation, which is a characteristic of a hawkish stance. A hawkish stance is associated with a preference for tighter monetary policy to combat inflation, even if it means slower economic growth. 

However, I can also make a case for "irrelevant" since the sentence does not directly relate to

I classified the sentence as dovish because it implies that the speaker is concerned about the persistence of low inflation and is uncertain about the impact of economic recovery on prices, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance.

The sentence discusses the central bank's commitment to its primary mandate, which involves managing inflation, and mentions the importance of considering core inflation over headline inflation when making monetary policy decisions due to the volatility of the non-core component. This focus on inflation, particularly core inflation, which tends to reflect underlying trends more accurately, can be seen as a careful approach to monetary policy, emphasizing the achievement of the inflation target.

Given this analysis, the stance seems neither strongly expansionary (dovish) nor contractionary (hawkish) but rather measured
