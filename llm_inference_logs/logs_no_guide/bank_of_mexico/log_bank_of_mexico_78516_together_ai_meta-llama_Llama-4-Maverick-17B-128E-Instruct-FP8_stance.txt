A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

2025-04-14 13:29:46,363 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence according to the Bank of Mexico's monetary policy stance, let's analyze its content.

The sentence mentions that "low economic activity and reduced risk aversion open space for further easing." This indicates a leaning towards a more accommodative monetary policy, which is typically associated with a dovish stance. Although it also notes that the "temporary increase in inflation could reduce this margin for a few months," the overall tone suggests that easing is considered possible due to current economic conditions.

Therefore, the classification should reflect the overall dovish tone due to the mention of "further easing" as a possibility based on current economic conditions.

Here's the output
2025-04-14 13:29:46,363 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence according to the Bank of Mexico's monetary policy stance, let's analyze its content.

The sentence mentions that "the persistence of monthly inflation has been reduced to less than half the level of 2009, thus contributing to prevent expectations from being contaminated." This indicates a positive development regarding inflation control, suggesting that the situation is improving.

Given this context, the improvement in inflation and the prevention of contaminated expectations could imply a less urgent need for tight monetary policy, leaning towards a dovish stance. However, the overall tone is more about acknowledging a positive development rather than directly signaling a policy shift.

Let's examine the options:

2025-04-14 13:29:46,363 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence according to the Bank of Mexico's monetary policy stance, let's analyze the information provided.

The sentence lists several points made by an individual (likely a policymaker or an analyst) regarding Mexico's monetary policy stance in comparison to the United States. The key points include:
- The volatility-adjusted interest rate spread relative to the U.S. is high among emerging economies.
- The Mexican peso has performed well with low volatility.
- Mexico's policy should rely on domestic variables rather than just following the Federal Reserve's stance.
- A 75-basis point increase would put Mexico's policy stance in restrictive territory.
- Mexico doesn't face
2025-04-14 13:29:46,363 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence regarding the Bank of Mexico's monetary policy meeting, let's analyze it step by step.

1. **Understanding the Sentence**: The sentence mentions that the direction of adjustments of the target rate is considered an even stronger signal than the level of the reference rate itself.

2. **Analyzing the Content**: The key elements here are "direction of adjustments" and "target rate." The direction of adjustments refers to whether the rate is being increased or decreased. The fact that this direction is highlighted as a significant signal implies that the focus is on the change (or the intent behind it) rather than the current level of the rate
2025-04-14 13:29:46,364 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence and provide a justification, let's analyze it step by step.

1. **Understanding the Sentence**: The sentence mentions that real wages in almost all advanced economies have started to show negative variations, which could lead to future adjustments in private consumption.

2. **Contextualizing the Sentence**: The context is a monetary policy meeting of the Bank of Mexico. The discussion is likely about the implications of economic conditions (in this case, real wages and private consumption in advanced economies) on monetary policy decisions.

3. **Analyzing the Content**:
   - The sentence discusses a negative trend in real wages in advanced economies and its potential

2025-04-14 13:30:43,161 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence and provide a justification, let's analyze it step by step.

1. **Understanding the Sentence**: The sentence mentions that one member emphasized the unemployment rate being below the NAIRU and that its increase doesn't imply the presence of slack. NAIRU stands for Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment, which is the rate of unemployment at which inflation is stable. If the unemployment rate is below NAIRU, it typically suggests that the economy is at or beyond full employment, potentially leading to inflationary pressures.

2. **Analyzing the Implication**: The statement implies that despite the unemployment rate increasing, it is
2025-04-14 13:30:43,161 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence according to the Bank of Mexico's monetary policy stance, let's analyze its content.

The sentence mentions adopting "a highly accommodative stance" due to the expectation of a "fragile, difficult and prolonged economic recovery." An accommodative monetary policy stance typically involves easing monetary conditions, such as lowering interest rates or implementing quantitative easing, to stimulate economic growth.

Given this context, the sentence is clearly indicating a supportive or easing stance on monetary policy.

Therefore, the classification should be as follows:

2025-04-14 13:30:43,161 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence according to the Bank of Mexico's monetary policy stance, let's analyze its content.

The sentence discusses the risks to non-core and core inflation and their susceptibility to monetary policy actions. It highlights that risks to core inflation are considered more asymmetrical and are, in principle, susceptible to monetary policy actions. This implies a focus on controlling core inflation through monetary policy, which is typically associated with a more cautious or restrictive monetary stance.

Given this analysis, the classification should reflect a stance that is more inclined towards tightening or being cautious with monetary policy, which is characteristic of a "hawkish" stance.

Here's the output following the

1. **Understanding the Sentence**: The sentence is "they mentioned that this upward adjustment was due to the rise continued decreasing." This sentence seems to be somewhat awkwardly phrased or possibly incomplete, but it appears to be discussing an "upward adjustment" that is related to a "rise" that is "continued decreasing." Despite the awkward phrasing, we can infer that there's a discussion about an adjustment (potentially of interest rates) and its rationale.
