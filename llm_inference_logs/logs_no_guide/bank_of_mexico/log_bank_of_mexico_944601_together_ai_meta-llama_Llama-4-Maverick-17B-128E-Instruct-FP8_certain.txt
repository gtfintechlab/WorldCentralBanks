A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "some members noted that the balance of risks for world economic growth is biased to the downside and is subject to high uncertainty, mainly for european economies."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence indicates a level of doubt or unpredictability regarding world economic growth, especially highlighting that it "is subject to high uncertainty." This kind of language typically signifies uncertainty.

2. **Justification**: The use of phrases like "balance of risks... is biased to the downside" and "is subject to high uncertainty" directly implies a lack of certainty about future economic growth.
2025-04-14 13:36:23,514 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence discusses various economic factors and their potential impact on inflation, referencing specific data (e.g., the deflator for durable goods spending) and general conditions (e.g., lack of flexibility in production, distortions in the labor market). The language used is analytical and observational, indicating a discussion based on observed data and trends.

However, the key to determining the certainty or uncertainty of the statement lies in understanding the nature of its claims. The sentence mentions that certain factors "could be associated" with specific perceptions and effects, which introduces a level of speculation or uncertainty regarding the direct

The sentence is: "similarly, the same member mentioned that an escalation of trade tensions between china and the u.s. may benefit mexico, as a result of the natural redirectioning of certain bilateral trade flows between those countries."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence contains the word "may," which is a modal verb often used to express possibility or uncertainty. The presence of "may" indicates that the outcome or benefit to Mexico is not definite but rather a possibility.

The sentence discusses a member's mention of a risk factor related to the fiscal front in emerging economies, highlighting an expected deterioration in certain financial indicators due to specific economic pressures. The key elements to focus on for classification are the language and tone used.

1. **Language and Tone Analysis**:
   - The sentence uses phrases like "continues to be a risk factor" and "is expected," which indicate a level of anticipation or prediction rather than a statement of fact.
   - It discusses "deterioration" and "budgetary pressures," which are negative outlooks.
2025-04-14 13:36:25,120 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and context.

The sentence is: "one member noted that this has been due to the fact that, in an uncertain environment, they have been highly sensitive to economic data."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence directly mentions being "in an uncertain environment," which indicates a lack of certainty or clarity about future events or conditions.

2. **Justification**: The presence of the word "uncertain" to describe the environment directly implies uncertainty.

Therefore, the classification is as follows:

The sentence provided is: "some members mentioned the stabilization of the labor participation rate."

Let's break down the task:

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence does not assert a fact directly but reports on what "some members mentioned." The use of "some members mentioned" indicates a report of a statement or opinion rather than a direct assertion of fact by the speaker. This suggests a level of detachment or indirectness.

The sentence is: "he/she warned that this problem could worsen due to the economic slowdown and to lower tax revenues derived from the support measures for pemex."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence contains the word "warned" and the phrase "could worsen," which indicate a level of uncertainty or prediction about future events rather than a statement of fact.

2. **Justification**: The use of "could worsen" suggests a possibility rather than a certainty, indicating uncertainty about the future outcome.

The sentence is: "all members noted that interest rates on medium- and long-term government bonds increased idiosyncratic factors."

First, we need to understand the sentence. It appears to be discussing a point made by all members during a meeting (likely the Bank of Mexico's monetary policy meeting) regarding the increase in interest rates on medium- and long-term government bonds due to idiosyncratic factors.

The key elements to determine the certainty or uncertainty of the statement are the phrases "all members noted" and the content of what was noted.

The sentence is: "another member noted that the negative output gap continues to be above 4% and is not expected to close before 2023."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence contains a projection or expectation about a future event ("is not expected to close before 2023"), which inherently involves uncertainty.

2. **Justification**: The use of "noted" and "is not expected" in the sentence indicates a discussion based on current information and projections, suggesting uncertainty about future outcomes.

Given these observations, the output should be structured as follows:

The sentence provided is: "another member pointed out that, although gross fixed investment rebounded in january, it declined again in february."

Let's break down the task:

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence reports on a statement made by a member regarding the trend of gross fixed investment. The information is presented as a factual report of what was pointed out, without expressing a clear opinion or forecast that would inherently carry uncertainty.

2. **Justification**:
2025-04-14 13:36:33,964 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and implications.

The sentence is: "however, he/she indicated that this sector has not shown a clear trend since mid-2023."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence implies a lack of clear direction or certainty regarding the sector's performance since mid-2023. The use of "has not shown a clear trend" directly points to uncertainty about the sector's future or current state.

2. **Justification**: The phrase "has not shown a clear trend" indicates a lack of definitive direction or pattern, suggesting uncertainty.

The sentence is: "one member added that headline inflation has been affected by significant adjustments stemming from both the exchange rate and from pressures to non-core inflation, particularly energy prices."

This sentence reports a statement made by a member, indicating that it is conveying information that is based on a specific viewpoint or observation rather than stating a fact directly. The use of "one member added" suggests that the information is part of a discussion or a meeting, and the content reflects an interpretation or an analysis of the factors affecting headline inflation.

Given this, the sentence is reporting on a specific analysis

The sentence is: "as to the core component, some members highlighted that it has shown persistence."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence implies a discussion or analysis by some members regarding the core component's behavior. The key phrases here are "some members highlighted" and "it has shown persistence." The fact that "some members" are discussing this indicates a subset of a group is in agreement or has a particular observation, not necessarily all members. This suggests a degree of subjectivity or variability in opinion within the group.

The sentence is: "finally, one member also mentioned the potential impact of the increase to the tax on flavored drinks and on cigarettes projected on the 2020 budget."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence discusses a "potential impact," which indicates a discussion about something that may or may not happen. This kind of language typically introduces uncertainty.

The sentence discusses the Bank of Mexico's approach to monetary policy in the face of certain factors that pose risks to inflation and inflation expectations. It states that monetary policy "will be adjusted in a timely and robust manner" to achieve the inflation target and anchor inflation expectations.

The key elements to consider are the conditionality and the firmness of the action described:

1. The adjustment of monetary policy is conditional on "the presence and possible persistence of factors" that involve risks.
2. The language used ("will be adjusted") indicates a future action that is dependent on certain conditions being

The sentence is: "he/she stated that, from the first increase to date, short-term inflation expectations have only increased, so that the intended objective of the supposed reinforcement of monetary policy seems to have had very low effectiveness."

First, we observe that the sentence is reporting someone else's statement, which already introduces a layer of indirectness. The phrase "he/she stated that" indicates that the information is being relayed from another source, rather than being directly asserted by the speaker.

The sentence is: "however, some members highlighted that, according to Banco de México estimates, a wage-price spiral is not being observed."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence implies a level of uncertainty or debate regarding the presence of a wage-price spiral, as it mentions "some members highlighted" a specific condition based on the Bank's estimates. This indicates that not all members may agree on the absence or presence of a wage-price spiral, or it is a point of discussion.

The sentence is: "another member stated that in the united states, 2-year inflation expectations have been above 3% over the last weeks."

Let's break it down:

1. The sentence starts with "another member stated," which indicates that it is reporting someone else's statement or opinion. This already introduces a level of indirectness.
2. The statement itself is about a factual observation regarding 2-year inflation expectations in the United States being above 3% over the last weeks. This is a specific, verifiable

The sentence is: "thus, in order to achieve an orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to maintain the reference rate at its current level for an extended period."

First, we need to understand the context and the elements of the sentence. The sentence refers to the Bank of Mexico's decision regarding its monetary policy, specifically maintaining the reference rate. The phrase "in order to achieve" suggests a goal or intention, and "for an extended period" indicates a future commitment or plan.

2. **Justification**: The phrase "it is still to be seen" directly implies uncertainty about a future outcome.
