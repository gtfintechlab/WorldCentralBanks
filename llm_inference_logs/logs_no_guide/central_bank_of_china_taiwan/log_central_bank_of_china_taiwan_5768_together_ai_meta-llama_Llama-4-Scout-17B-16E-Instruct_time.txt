A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses potential future uncertainties and risks, indicating a focus on future events and prospects."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "forward looking" because it discusses future uncertainties and risks, such as repeated COVID-19 outbreaks, changes in monetary policy of major central banks, and lingering global economic and trade uncertainties, which indicates a focus on future events and prospects.
2025-04-14 22:47:15,840 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a historical decision made during a past meeting without providing any information about future policy intentions."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "not forward looking" because it simply states the outcome of a past decision regarding interest rates without providing any guidance or hints about potential future policy actions.
2025-04-14 22:47:15,840 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses the future state of the global economic outlook, implying a forward-looking perspective."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "forward looking" because it mentions the future state of the global economic outlook, indicating that it is discussing potential future developments rather than current or past events.
2025-04-14 22:47:15,840 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence describes past market movements and reactions to specific events, rather than making predictions or statements about future monetary policy actions."
}
```

This sentence is not forward looking because it reports on past market movements and reactions to specific events (e.g. "caused us and german 10-year government bond yields to fall"), rather than making predictions or statements about future events or monetary policy actions.
2025-04-14 22:47:15,840 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence describes past actions taken by the bank, without expressing future intentions or projections."
}
```

I chose "not forward looking" because the sentence reports on actions that have already been taken by the bank (managing market liquidity and keeping banks' excess reserves at a certain level), without providing any information about future plans or expectations.

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses past events and reactions to past data, without referencing future expectations or projections."
