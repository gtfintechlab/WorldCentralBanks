A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "around 70 of this increase came from price rises in food such as food away from home and entertainment services as well as higher rent, with a combined contribution of 1.72 percentage points."

Here's the analysis:

1. **Label**: The sentence is stating a fact about the composition of a certain increase, specifying the sources and quantifying their contribution. The language used is factual and does not express doubt or ambiguity about the information being presented.

The sentence is: "this director pointed out that co-movements between stock prices and exchange rates could create risks."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence is discussing a potential risk associated with the co-movements between stock prices and exchange rates. The key word here is "could," which indicates a possibility rather than a certainty.

2. **Justification**: The use of "could create risks" suggests that the occurrence of risks is conditional or possible, not definite, hence introducing uncertainty.

The sentence is: "in respect of domestic economic conditions, several board directors discussed the issue of domestic investment growth momentum."

To determine whether it is certain or uncertain, we need to look at the language used.

1. The phrase "several board directors discussed" indicates an action that took place, which is a factual statement and thus certain in terms of the action happening.
2. The phrase "the issue of domestic investment growth momentum" suggests that there was a topic of discussion, implying that the state or condition of domestic investment growth momentum was being examined or debated.

However
2025-04-14 22:54:46,652 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and the language used.

The sentence discusses future price trends and lists several factors that are expected to influence these trends, including the likelihood of a steeper increase in food prices due to the previous year's low prices for fruit and vegetables, a base wage hike driving up employee pay and prices for away-from-home food, and an increase in coach bus fares. The key phrases to focus on are "is likely to result," "would drive upwards," and "would be raised," which indicate predictions or expectations about future events.

Given this analysis, the classification can be determined as follows:

First, we observe that the sentence contains two main clauses: 
1. "domestic inflation has continued to come down gradually in the year so far" - This part is a statement of fact about what has happened.
2. "is expected to drop to below 2 next year" - This part expresses a future prediction.

The first clause is a factual statement about a past trend and is certain because it reports on

The sentence discusses the uneven growth among major economies, specifying the performance of the US, euro area, UK, Japan, and China. It states facts about the economic performance of these regions without expressing a clear future prediction or ambiguity that would typically be associated with uncertainty.

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence is discussing potential outcomes ("could hinder" and "jeopardize") that are conditional on certain risks materializing ("should they materialize"). This indicates a level of uncertainty because it is not stating that the risks will definitely materialize or that the negative outcomes are certain.

The sentence is: "based on the assessments thereof, the bank may adjust its monetary policy timely and appropriately to fulfill the statutory duties of maintaining price stability, safeguarding financial stability, and fostering economic development."

The key elements to consider are the phrases "may adjust" and the context in which they are used. The use of "may adjust" indicates a possibility or potential action rather than a definitive or certain one. This kind of phrasing typically introduces uncertainty because it leaves open the possibility that the action might not be taken.

Given this analysis, the classification should reflect the uncertainty

2. **Justification**: The sentence is uncertain because it uses the word "could," which suggests a potential outcome rather than a definitive one.

Therefore, the classification output is:
