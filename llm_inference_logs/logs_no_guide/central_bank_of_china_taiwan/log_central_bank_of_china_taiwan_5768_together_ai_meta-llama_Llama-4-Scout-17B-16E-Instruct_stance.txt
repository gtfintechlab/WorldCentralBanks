A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence highlights various uncertainties and risks in the global economic outlook, suggesting a cautious and accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

The sentence mentions several downside risks to the global economy, including COVID-19 outbreaks, financial fragilities, and global economic and trade uncertainties. This tone suggests that the Central Bank of China (Taiwan) may maintain a dovish or accommodative monetary policy stance to mitigate these risks, which is consistent with a dovish classification.
2025-04-14 22:45:38,098 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The decision to keep interest rates unchanged indicates a neutral stance, as it neither tightens nor loosens monetary policy."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence reports no changes to the interest rates, which suggests that the Central Bank of China (Taiwan) is maintaining its current monetary policy stance, neither becoming more hawkish (tightening policy) nor dovish (loosening policy).
2025-04-14 22:45:38,098 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my response:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions uncertainty in the global economic outlook, which could be a concern for monetary policy, but does not indicate a clear direction for interest rates or policy stance."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence is more of a statement of fact about the economic outlook, rather than a clear indication of a hawkish (inflation-fighting) or dovish (stimulative) policy stance. The sentence does not provide enough information to suggest that the Central Bank of China (Taiwan) is leaning towards tightening or loosening monetary policy
2025-04-14 22:45:38,098 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions falling government bond yields and rallying global stock markets, indicating a market expectation of looser monetary policy, which is consistent with a dovish stance."
}
```

Note that the sentence does not directly mention the Central Bank of China (Taiwan)'s monetary policy, but based on the context and the information provided, we can infer that the sentence is related to the global market reaction, which can influence the Central Bank of China (Taiwan)'s decision. The sentence is not directly irrelevant, and it hints at a dov
2025-04-14 22:45:38,098 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates that the Central Bank of China (Taiwan) is maintaining a stable liquidity environment, which suggests a neutral stance as it neither tightens nor loosens monetary policy."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence describes the bank's actions as managing market liquidity and keeping excess reserves at an "adequately accommodative level", which implies a maintenance of the current policy stance rather than a shift towards tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) policy.

The sentence simply reports on the Central Bank of China's (Taiwan) economic projection without expressing any clear intention to adjust monetary policy, which suggests a neutral stance. There is no indication of a hawkish (concerned about inflation and potentially raising interest rates) or dovish (focused on economic growth and potentially lowering interest rates) tone.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides an objective analysis of global economic trends without expressing a clear stance on monetary policy, thus it is neutral."
}
```

The sentence discusses global economic trends, such as cooling goods demand, easing supply disruptions, and falling supply chain pressures, but does not mention anything about interest rates, inflation, or other monetary policy indicators that would suggest a hawkish, dovish, or irrelevant stance. Therefore, I classify it as neutral.

{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that cutting rates would be an 'ill-timed adjustment' due to upside inflationary pressures, implying a cautious or restrictive monetary policy stance."

This classification indicates that the sentence has a hawkish tone, as it expresses concerns about inflation and implies that rate cuts might not be suitable at the moment.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a cautious and potentially accommodative monetary policy stance, as it highlights uncertainties and a slower growth pace, which could lead to a more dovish tone."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "dovish" because it presents a cautious outlook on the economy, mentioning uncertainties and a slower growth pace, which could suggest that the Central Bank of China (Taiwan) might adopt a more accommodative monetary policy stance to mitigate potential risks.
2025-04-14 22:45:41,076 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a loosening of monetary policy as market interest rates have slipped downwards, suggesting an accommodative stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that a decrease in market interest rates is often associated with a more accommodative or expansionary monetary policy, which is characteristic of a dovish stance.
2025-04-14 22:45:41,076 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence acknowledges the challenge of managing inflation in a small open economy like Taiwan, but does not express a clear stance on monetary policy."
}
```

The sentence is neutral because it simply states a fact about the difficulty of managing inflation in a small open economy like Taiwan, without expressing a clear opinion or intention to tighten or loosen monetary policy. There is no hawkish (inflation-fighting) or dovish (growth-supporting) tone, hence the label "neutral".

  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual projection about the economy without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance, thus it is neutral."
}
```

The sentence simply states a projection about the economy, mentioning a "higher base effect" and "mild real growth" without suggesting any specific action or change in the monetary policy stance that would lean towards being hawkish (tightening) or dovish (loosening). Therefore, it is classified as neutral.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual update on the ratio of real estate loans to total loans, but does not convey a clear stance on monetary policy, thus it is neutral."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply reports a statistic about banks' lending concentration in real estate loans, without expressing a clear opinion or intention that would suggest a hawkish (tightening), dovish (loosening), or irrelevant (unrelated to monetary policy) stance.

  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates a continued accommodative monetary policy stance, which suggests a supportive and loose policy approach, characteristic of a dovish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the language used in the sentence, which mentions a "continued accommodative monetary policy stance", implying a commitment to maintaining a supportive policy environment. This is consistent with a dovish monetary policy stance, which prioritizes economic growth and stability over inflation concerns.

{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The statement justifies the adjustment proposition due to persistent housing price increases, indicating a concern about inflation and a potential tightening of monetary policy."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "hawkish" because it suggests that the Central Bank of China (Taiwan) is concerned about the persistent increase in housing prices, which could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to curb inflation. This is a hawkish stance, as it prioritizes inflation control over economic growth.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions the effects of existing policies and economic conditions, but does not indicate a change in the monetary policy stance, suggesting a neutral tone."

The tone is informative and observational, rather than advocating for a specific policy action.

I chose "neutral" because the sentence seems to be asking a question about the effect of a specific factor (ETF assets) on a monetary policy indicator (M2 growth), without indicating a bias towards tightening (hawkish) or easing (dovish) monetary policy. The tone is inquiring and analytical, rather than advocating for a specific policy stance.

The sentence simply reports on the economic situation, specifically the impact of foreign capital inflows on the NT dollar's value against the US dollar, without expressing any hawkish ( inclination to raise interest rates) or dovish (inclination to lower interest rates) stance. Therefore, it is classified as "neutral".

```

The sentence seems to be more informative and observational, discussing the potential impact of the Fed's decision on the NT dollar exchange rate, rather than explicitly stating a hawkish (favoring rate hikes) or dovish (favoring rate cuts) stance. Therefore, I classified it as "neutral".
2025-04-14 22:45:49,803 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions downward revision and cites factors indicating a prolonged period of low growth, suggesting a accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

The sentence implies that the Central Bank of China (Taiwan) is concerned about low global growth and is considering a downward revision, which is a dovish stance. The mention of supply-side and demand-side factors, as well as long-term structural factors, suggests that the bank is focused on supporting economic growth, which is consistent with a dovish monetary policy stance.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence highlights a decline in employment and overtime hours in the manufacturing sector, suggesting economic weakness, which is a dovish signal."

The sentence implies that the economy is experiencing weakness, particularly in the manufacturing sector, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance, hence the "dovish" classification.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual update on the economic situation without indicating any specific policy action or bias, suggesting a neutral stance."

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply reports on the current economic situation, mentioning the control of the pandemic, recovery in global economic and trade activities, and the uptrend in international crude oil and commodity prices, without expressing any hawkish (tightening) or dovish (loosening) sentiments.
2025-04-14 22:45:49,803 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence highlights a downtrend in inflation rates, which could suggest a less hawkish or more accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

My reasoning is that the sentence mentions a decrease in inflation rates, which might imply that the Central Bank of China (Taiwan) may not need to raise interest rates aggressively, leaning towards a dovish stance.

{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual update on the monetary aggregate M2 growth rate, stating it is still within the reference range, without indicating a change in policy stance."

{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a relaxed monetary policy stance by expecting a decline in CPI growth rate, which may reduce the need for tightening monetary policy."
}
```

The sentence is classified as "dovish" because it suggests that the Central Bank of China (Taiwan) may not need to take aggressive action to combat inflation, given the expected decline in CPI growth rate. This implies a more accommodative monetary policy stance, which is characteristic of a dovish stance.

{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions upside pressures on staple prices and potential price increases due to rising energy costs, indicating a concern about inflation and a possible tightening of monetary policy."

This suggests that the Central Bank of China (Taiwan) might be more likely to raise interest rates or tighten monetary policy to combat inflation.

  "justification": "The sentence mentions uncertainties, which suggests a cautious tone, but does not express a clear direction or bias towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence does not contain language that would suggest a hawkish (inflation-fighting, rate-hiking) or dovish (growth-supporting, rate-cutting) stance. The mention of uncertainties is a neutral/ cautious statement that does not lean towards either direction.

  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates a rate hold, which suggests no change in the monetary policy stance, hence a neutral classification."

Explanation:
- "Hawkish" typically implies a stance that is more inclined towards raising interest rates to combat inflation.
- "Dovish" implies a stance that is more inclined towards lowering interest rates to stimulate the economy.
- "Neutral" implies no change or a balanced view, which aligns with supporting a rate hold.
- "Irrelevant" would imply the sentence does not relate to monetary policy, which is

  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides factual information about the current inflation rate without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance."

```

The sentence simply reports on the current state of the economy, mentioning both positive (solid growth in private consumption) and negative (sluggish private investment) trends, without suggesting that the Central Bank of China (Taiwan) would need to adjust its monetary policy stance. Therefore, I classify the sentence as "neutral".

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates a strong commitment to rein in inflation, suggesting a tightening or restrictive monetary policy stance, which is characteristic of a hawkish stance."
}
```

I chose "hawkish" because the sentence implies a focus on controlling inflation, which is a key concern of a hawkish monetary policy stance. The mention of "rein in inflation" and "lower inflation expectations" suggests that the Central Bank of China (Taiwan) is prioritizing inflation control, which is consistent with a hawkish approach.

  "justification": "The sentence mentions monetary tightening measures and higher interest rates, indicating a restrictive monetary policy stance."

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence cautions about monitoring the effects of policy implementation, indicating a wait-and-see approach rather than a clear tightening or loosening stance."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence does not indicate a clear direction of monetary policy easing or tightening, but rather a cautious and monitoring approach. This suggests that the Central Bank of China (Taiwan) is not taking a strong stance, either hawkish (tightening) or dovish (loosening), but rather a neutral one.

2025-04-14 22:46:14,857 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions a consistent exchange rate policy aimed at dynamic stability, implying a balanced and non-extreme approach, which is characteristic of a neutral monetary policy stance."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence does not indicate a tightening or loosening of monetary policy, but rather a commitment to stability, which is a neutral stance. There is no indication of a hawkish (tightening) or dovish (loosening) stance.
2025-04-14 22:46:14,857 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies that the coronavirus outbreak is having a negative impact on the global economy, suggesting a dovish stance as it may lead to accommodative monetary policy."
}
```

The reasoning is that the mention of "serious supply and demand shocks" to the global economy implies a negative economic outlook, which is typically associated with a dovish monetary policy stance, characterized by a willingness to ease policy to mitigate the economic downturn.
2025-04-14 22:46:14,857 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To provide a response, I need a specific sentence related to the Central Bank of China (Taiwan)'s monetary policy meeting. Since you haven't provided a particular sentence, I'll create a hypothetical scenario based on common understandings of monetary policy stances.

Let's assume the sentence is: "The Central Bank of China (Taiwan) decided to raise the interest rate by 25 basis points to curb inflationary pressures."

Here's my response:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The decision to raise the interest rate indicates a tightening of monetary policy, which is characteristic of a hawkish stance."
}
```

2025-04-14 22:46:14,857 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions a potential upward pressure on prices due to a tax hike, but does not indicate a significant concern about inflation or a change in the monetary policy stance."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply states a fact about a potential price increase due to a tax hike, without expressing a strong concern about inflation that would suggest a hawkish stance, nor does it suggest a dovish stance by downplaying inflation risks or implying a need for policy easing. The tone is informative and objective, rather than advocating for a specific
2025-04-14 22:46:14,857 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides an economic forecast without indicating any change in monetary policy or a clear bias towards tightening or easing, hence it is neutral."
}
```

The sentence simply states an expectation about economic indicators (exports and private investment posting negative real growth) without expressing a clear stance on monetary policy, which would be characteristic of a hawkish (favoring tighter monetary policy) or dovish (favoring looser monetary policy) statement. Therefore, it is classified as neutral.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The director's decision to keep policy rates steady indicates a neutral stance, as it implies no change in the current monetary policy."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that keeping policy rates steady implies no tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) of monetary policy, hence a neutral stance.

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The mention of stricter credit controls, including no grace period and lower LTV ratios, indicates a tightening of monetary policy, which is a hawkish stance."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "hawkish" because it mentions stricter credit controls, which suggests that the Central Bank of China (Taiwan) is taking a more restrictive approach to lending, aiming to reduce borrowing and mitigate potential risks. This is consistent with a hawkish monetary policy stance.

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a potential tightening of monetary policy to address real estate lending, indicating a cautious or hawkish stance."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "hawkish" because it suggests that the Central Bank of China (Taiwan) is prepared to take further measures to monitor and potentially address real estate lending, implying a willingness to tighten policy if necessary. This indicates a cautious or hawkish stance, rather than a dovish or neutral one.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides an objective outlook on private investment without indicating any inclination towards tightening or loosening monetary policy."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply presents a positive forecast for private investment based on an improving outlook for goods exports, without suggesting any specific action or bias towards a more hawkish (tightening) or dovish (loosening) monetary policy stance.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that inflation rates are expected to decrease and ease to below 2%, indicating a relaxed monetary policy stance."
}
```

The reasoning behind this classification is that the sentence implies a positive outlook on inflation, with rates expected to decrease, which is often associated with a dovish monetary policy stance, where the central bank is more likely to implement expansionary policies to support economic growth.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a mechanical adjustment to bank lending rates, suggesting no significant change in the monetary policy stance."

{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a neutral outlook on economic growth, mentioning a 'slightly slower or similar pace' without indicating a significant change in monetary policy or a strong bias towards tightening or easing."
}
```

This sentence does not indicate a clear direction for monetary policy, nor does it express a strong concern about inflation (hawkish) or economic growth (dovish). The tone is more balanced, focusing on the projection of economic growth without suggesting a specific policy action, which aligns with a neutral stance.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides an economic growth forecast without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance, making it neutral."

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a potential tightening of monetary policy in response to the US Fed and other central banks reducing accommodation, indicating a hawkish stance."
}
```

Explanation: The sentence mentions that other central banks are reducing monetary policy accommodation, which suggests that the Central Bank of China (Taiwan) may also consider tightening its monetary policy, indicating a hawkish stance. The tone is cautious and concerned about the global economic slowdown, but the focus on reducing accommodation implies a hawkish bias.

The sentence provided does not directly relate to the Central Bank of China's (Taiwan) monetary policy decisions or indicate a clear direction of policy stance (hawkish for tightening, dovish for loosening).

{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence emphasizes the Central Bank of China's role in maintaining price stability, financial stability, and fostering economic development, without indicating a specific direction or bias towards tightening or loosening monetary policy."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "neutral" because it focuses on the bank's statutory duties and the possibility of adjusting monetary policy in a timely and appropriate manner, without expressing a clear hawkish (inflation-fighting) or dovish (growth-supporting) stance.
2025-04-14 22:46:19,309 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The mention of the US Fed's balance sheet normalization program and the ECB's potential review of its asset purchase scheme implies a concern about global monetary policy tightening, suggesting a hawkish stance."
}
```

The sentence implies that the speaker is aware of potential tightening of monetary policies by other major central banks, which could influence the Central Bank of China's (Taiwan) decision, leaning towards a hawkish stance.
2025-04-14 22:46:19,309 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a positive outlook on employment and wage growth, which could lead to increased private consumption, indicating a supportive monetary policy stance."

I classified the sentence as "dovish" because it implies a optimistic view on economic growth and suggests that the economy may not require tightening of monetary policy, which is a characteristic of a dovish stance.
2025-04-14 22:46:19,309 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance based on the given sentence, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Understanding the context**: The sentence discusses labor market conditions in terms of the unemployment rate and the number of employed persons.

2. **Identifying key information**: 
   - The unemployment rate fell slightly compared to the same period of the previous year.
   - The number of employed persons recorded a modest year-on-year decrease.

3. **Interpreting the data**:
   - A slight decrease in the unemployment rate could indicate a strengthening labor market or at least stability, which might not necessarily call for immediate easing of monetary policy.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence clarifies the purpose of the Central Bank of China's measures, framing them as financial stability measures rather than direct attempts to control housing prices, which suggests a neutral stance."
}
```

The sentence does not indicate a tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) of monetary policy, but rather provides context and clarification on existing measures, which aligns with a neutral stance.
2025-04-14 22:46:20,944 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a positive economic indicator, but does not suggest any specific monetary policy action or change in stance."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply reports on a positive development in global trade activity without implying any change in the Central Bank of China's monetary policy stance. The sentence does not contain any hawkish (suggesting tighter monetary policy) or dovish (suggesting looser monetary policy) signals, making "neutral" the most suitable classification.
2025-04-14 22:46:20,944 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence focuses on the positive outlook of domestic demand and private investment, but does not mention any specific monetary policy actions or changes, indicating a neutral stance."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence provides an optimistic view on domestic demand and private investment, but it does not imply any tightening or loosening of monetary policy, nor does it suggest a change in the current policy stance. The sentence appears to be a factual analysis of economic trends rather than a policy statement.
2025-04-14 22:46:20,944 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions a projected slowdown in global economic growth, which suggests a potentially accommodative monetary policy stance, characteristic of a dovish tone."
}
```

The reasoning behind this classification is that the sentence highlights a negative outlook on global economic growth, which is often associated with a dovish monetary policy stance, as it may warrant a more accommodative policy to mitigate the potential downturn.
2025-04-14 22:46:20,944 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The director's statement highlights signs of economic weakening, suggesting a cautious or accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

The director's mention of leading indicators trending downwards, exports weakening, and a monitoring indicator descending to the lower threshold of the stable signal range implies a concern for the economy's growth prospects, which is consistent with a dovish monetary policy stance.

The sentence simply reports on the current state of the labor market, noting both positive (unemployment rate downtrend, increase in employed persons) and negative (not yet back to pre-pandemic levels) trends, without suggesting that the Central Bank of China (Taiwan) would need to adjust its monetary policy stance. Therefore, I classify the sentence as "neutral".

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply reports on the state of the labor market without suggesting that the Central Bank of China (Taiwan) should tighten (hawkish) or loosen (dovish) its monetary policy. The mention of the unemployment rate remaining high might suggest some concern, but it does not explicitly advocate for a policy change, hence neutral.
