A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence reports historical data and does not discuss future economic or policy prospects."
}
```

The sentence provides specific data on the annual growth rate of SME loans and overall bank lending as of the end of April 2021, which is a report on past or current information, and does not contain any information about future expectations, projections, or guidance, which are typical characteristics of forward-looking statements.
2025-04-14 22:57:59,938 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence describes past events and trends in the international financial markets, without making predictions or referring to future economic conditions or policy actions."
}
```

This sentence is not forward looking because it only discusses what happened in the past (e.g., "equity price volatility intensified at the beginning of the year", "VIX... dropped then and moved within a narrower range"), without expressing expectations or projections about future events or economic indicators.

Given sentence: "related discussions are summarized as follows"

## Analysis
The sentence "related discussions are summarized as follows" appears to be an introductory phrase used to present a summary of previous discussions or decisions. It does not contain any information about future actions, projections, or guidance regarding the Central Bank of China's (Taiwan) monetary policy.

## Classification
Given that the sentence does not provide any information about future economic conditions, policy intentions, or projections, it is reasonable to classify it as not forward looking.
