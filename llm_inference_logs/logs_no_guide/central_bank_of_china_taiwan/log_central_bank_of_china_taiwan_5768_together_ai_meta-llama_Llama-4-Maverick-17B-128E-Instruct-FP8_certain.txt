A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "the bank projected taiwans economy to expand by 4.05 this year, while the growth projections by major institutions ranged between 3.11 and 4.42."

First, we observe that the sentence contains a specific projection made by the bank regarding Taiwan's economic expansion, which is 4.05%. This is a definitive statement about the bank's projection.

However, the sentence also mentions that the growth projections by major institutions varied, ranging between 3.11% and 4.42%. This indicates a range of possible outcomes

The sentence is: "meanwhile, a historically low rate level, upside inflationary pressures from rising raw material prices and transportation costs, and ample market liquidity all made a rate cut an ill-timed adjustment."

Here's the step-by-step thought process:

1. **Understanding the sentence**: The sentence discusses factors that influenced the decision regarding a rate cut by the Central Bank of China (Taiwan) during a monetary policy meeting. It mentions specific economic conditions (low rate level, inflationary pressures, and market liquidity) that made a rate cut "an ill-timed adjustment."

The sentence provided is: "export growth is likely to benefit from a firming global economy next year."

Let's break down the task:

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence contains the phrase "is likely to benefit," which indicates a degree of probability rather than a definitive statement.

2. **Justification**: The use of "likely to" suggests that the outcome is not certain but is based on a probability, hence indicating uncertainty.

The sentence is: "the board directors also discussed the feds decision to initiate balance sheet normalization in october and how this might affect the nt dollar exchange rate"

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence discusses a discussion about a past event (the Fed's decision) and its potential impact on the NT dollar exchange rate. The key phrase here is "how this might affect," which indicates speculation or uncertainty about future outcomes.

2. **Justification**: The use of "might affect" suggests that the impact is not certain, indicating uncertainty.

Therefore, the classification is:

The sentence states: "moreover, in recent months, the number of employed persons and the amount of overtime hours worked both continued decreasing in the manufacturing sector but rose further in the services sector."

This sentence reports on specific trends observed in the employment and overtime hours in different sectors of the economy. The language used is factual and descriptive, indicating observed changes without expressing doubt or uncertainty about these changes.

Therefore, the classification is as follows:

The sentence is: "against such a background, inflation rates of most major economies have displayed a drastic downtrend from their peak levels, whereas core inflation rates have eased at a mild pace."

This sentence reports on a factual trend observed in inflation rates without expressing a clear future prediction or ambiguity that would typically be associated with uncertainty. The language used describes observed changes ("have displayed," "have eased") rather than speculating on future changes or using modal verbs that could indicate doubt or uncertainty.

Therefore, the classification is as follows:

The sentence discusses a board director's agreement with the propositions made during a monetary policy meeting and outlines the considerations behind a specific policy rate increase. The key phrases to focus on for determining certainty or uncertainty are those that indicate the tone and language used regarding the events or decisions described.

Upon examination, the sentence contains phrases such as "likely slackening off," "sputtering," and discusses specific economic indicators and their implications. The use of "likely" and "sputtering" introduces a level of uncertainty because they indicate potential or probable events rather than definitive outcomes.

1. The word "therefore" indicates a conclusion based on previous discussion or analysis, suggesting a decision has been made.
2. The phrase "the director was in favor of" directly states the director's stance on the issue.
3. "keeping the policy rates steady" clearly indicates the action the director supports.

Given these points, the sentence directly conveys the director's opinion or decision without expressing doubt or ambiguity.
