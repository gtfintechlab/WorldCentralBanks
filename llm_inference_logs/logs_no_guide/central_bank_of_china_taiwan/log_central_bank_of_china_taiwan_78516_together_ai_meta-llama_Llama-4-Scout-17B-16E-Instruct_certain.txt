A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence presents a factual claim based on research findings, without expressing doubt or ambiguity."

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it states a conclusion based on research ("research shows that...") and presents it as a fact, without using uncertain language such as "suggests," "may be," or "is likely to be." The use of "suggesting" in the sentence introduces a conclusion that follows from the research, but the overall tone is one of presenting a finding rather than expressing uncertainty.

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it mentions a proposal or suggestion for adjusting LTV caps, but does not indicate that the change has been made or is definite. The use of phrases such as "expressed support for the adjustment" and "would help restrain property speculation" suggests a potential or proposed action rather than a certain one.

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it does not provide specific details about the monetary policy meeting and instead seems to describe a general concept. The sentence mentions the government's help for banks and businesses, but it does not directly relate to the Central Bank's policy decisions or actions, making it uncertain.

{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a clear expectation about inflation rate based on a survey, indicating a certain level of confidence in the prediction."

However, upon re-reading, I think I made a mistake. The sentence actually expresses a prediction based on a survey, but it's still a prediction and not a fact. Therefore, I would revise my answer to:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a prediction or expectation about future inflation rate based on a survey, which is inherently uncertain."

{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports specific, factual data about the annual growth rates of CPI and core CPI for a given period, without any ambiguous language or uncertainty."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence provides concrete numbers and a specific time frame, indicating a statement of fact rather than an uncertain or speculative one.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a possibility or consideration rather than a definitive statement, indicated by the phrase 'may also include'."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it suggests that housing price trends "may also" be considered in the Central Bank of China's monetary policy conduct, implying that it is not a definite or fixed consideration.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions a range of inflation projections, indicating a lack of a single, definitive value."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence provides a range of values (2.20 to 3.80) rather than a specific, precise number, which suggests uncertainty.
2025-04-14 22:52:17,224 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains the word 'expected', which indicates a degree of uncertainty or prediction rather than a statement of fact."
}
```

This classification is based on the presence of the word "expected", which suggests that the increase in domestic consumption is a prediction or forecast rather than a confirmed fact, thereby introducing uncertainty.

{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a possibility of an economic slowdown in China, indicating uncertainty about its future economic performance."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it uses phrases like "saw greater risk" which implies a possibility rather than a certainty, and also describes uneven growth across various economies, indicating a degree of unpredictability.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence presents specific data and a clear conclusion about the absence of imported inflation pressures, indicating a statement of fact rather than uncertainty."
}
```

This sentence reports specific year-on-year increases in import prices and domestic sales prices, and draws a clear conclusion based on this data, which suggests a certain or factual statement rather than an uncertain or speculative one.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a potential future scenario with conditional phrases ('if', 'could ensue'), indicating uncertainty about the outcome."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "uncertain" because it discusses a possible future event that may or may not happen, depending on certain conditions (a wider US-Taiwan interest rate differential inducing more capital outflows). The use of words like "could ensue" and "if" indicates that the outcome is not guaranteed, hence the classification as uncertain.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a factual sequence of economic events and their impacts, without expressing doubt or ambiguity."

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it reports on specific economic trends and events, such as the strengthening of inflation expectations, the increase in long-term government bond yields, and the volatility in international stock markets, all of which are presented as facts rather than possibilities or opinions.
2025-04-14 22:52:39,599 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence uses 'expected to see' which indicates a prediction based on specific factors, suggesting a level of confidence or certainty about future growth."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because, although it discusses future projections, it is based on concrete factors such as "robust development of emerging technology applications, new capacity for advanced semiconductor production, and increased production in Taiwan". The tone implies a degree of confidence in these projections, rather than uncertainty.
