A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it clearly states that monetary authorities should not stay on the sidelines when housing prices continue to surge, despite tax policies being an effective tool. The sentence does not express ambiguity or doubt, but rather a definitive position, which is characteristic of certain language.

{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific fact about exports, indicating a certain state of affairs."
}
```

In this case, I classified the sentence as "certain" because it reports a specific fact about the exports of non-ai servers and mobile phones being "tepid", which implies a clear and definite state of affairs. There is no ambiguity or uncertainty expressed in the sentence.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a clear expectation about the future growth of real private investment, using the phrase 'expected' which implies a degree of confidence or certainty."
}
```

However, I can also argue that:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence uses the phrase 'on balance' and 'expected' which implies some degree of uncertainty or conditionality, even though the tone is generally positive."
}
```

Upon re-reading, I think the second classification is more accurate, as "on balance"

{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a clear and definitive action that the Central Bank of China (Taiwan) will take under specific circumstances, indicating certainty."

{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions that several board directors 'discussed' the issue, implying that there is no definitive decision or outcome, hence uncertain."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it describes a discussion or consideration of an issue, rather than a definitive statement or decision about domestic investment growth momentum.

```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it explicitly states that the policy rates will be kept unchanged "for the time being", indicating a clear and definitive decision. There is no ambiguity or indication of doubt or potential change, which suggests a certain outcome.
2025-04-14 22:57:27,746 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a conditional or prospective view on monetary policy, indicated by phrases such as 'supported a 25 bps rate hike' and 'suggested to continue monitoring', which implies uncertainty about future actions."
}
```

Although the sentence mentions a specific action that was supported (a 25 bps rate hike), the overall tone is cautious and conditional, with an emphasis on monitoring various factors, which suggests that the outcome or future actions are not entirely certain. Therefore, I classified the sentence as "uncertain".

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it reports on specific, factual information about economic projections, without any ambiguity or uncertainty. The use of phrases like "recently projected by international forecasters" and "register negative growth" suggests a level of confidence and certainty in the statement.
