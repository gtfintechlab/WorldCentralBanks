The sentence discusses several uncertainties facing the global economic outlook, including repeated COVID-19 outbreaks, financial fragilities, changes in major central banks' monetary policies, and global economic and trade uncertainties. It highlights the challenges and risks associated with the current global economic situation but does not directly indicate a specific direction for monetary policy adjustment.

However, by emphasizing the uncertainties and risks that could negatively impact the economy, the statement leans towards a cautious or accommodative stance, as it implicitly suggests the need for continued support or vigilance.
2025-04-14 22:48:00,192 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence regarding the Central Bank of China (Taiwan)'s monetary policy meeting, let's analyze the information provided.

The sentence states that the board members reached a unanimous vote to keep the discount rate and other related rates unchanged. This action implies that there is no adjustment in the monetary policy stance, as the rates are maintained at their current levels.

Given this context, we can infer that the decision to keep the rates unchanged suggests a continuation of the existing monetary policy without any tightening (hawkish) or easing (dovish) measures.

Therefore, the classification should reflect a neutral stance since there's no change in the interest rates
