A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

I chose "not forward looking" because the sentence provides a description of the current or past economic situation of various countries/regions, without indicating what will happen in the future. There are no words or phrases that suggest a forward-looking perspective, such as "will", "expect", "forecast", or "project".
