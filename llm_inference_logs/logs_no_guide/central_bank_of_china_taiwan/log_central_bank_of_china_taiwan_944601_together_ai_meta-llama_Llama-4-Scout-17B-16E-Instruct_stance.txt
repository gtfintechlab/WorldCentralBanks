A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual forecast of economic growth without indicating any change in monetary policy, resulting in a neutral stance."
}
```

The sentence discusses a forecast of private consumption growth and factors contributing to it, such as a hike in minimum wage and public sector pay, without suggesting any specific action or tone that would indicate a hawkish (concerned about inflation) or dovish (concerned about growth) monetary policy stance. Therefore, it is classified as neutral.

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies concern over rapid growth in real estate loans, suggesting a potential risk that may warrant a hawkish monetary policy stance to mitigate."
}
```

The sentence implies a potential risk associated with the rapid growth of real estate loans, which could lead to concerns about financial stability and inflation. This type of concern is typically associated with a hawkish monetary policy stance, which aims to curb inflation and maintain financial stability through tighter monetary policy. 

However, an alternative and reasonable classification could be:

{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a neutral outlook on economic growth, mentioning a 'slightly slower or similar pace' without indicating a significant change in monetary policy or a strong bias towards tightening or easing."
}
```

This sentence does not indicate a clear direction for monetary policy, nor does it express a strong concern about inflation (hawkish) or economic growth (dovish). The tone is more balanced, focusing on the projection of economic growth without suggesting a specific policy action, which aligns with a neutral stance.

I chose "neutral" because the statement does not indicate a clear intention to tighten (hawkish) or loosen (dovish) monetary policy, but rather a willingness to observe the situation before making a decision.

{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions 'monetary tightening' which indicates a restrictive monetary policy stance, characteristic of a hawkish position."
}
```

This classification is based on the understanding that "hawkish" refers to a monetary policy stance that is restrictive, aiming to curb inflation or economic growth, often through interest rate increases or other measures to reduce liquidity. The mention of "monetary tightening" directly supports this classification.

The sentence provided appears to be discussing global commodities and oil prices, without any reference to the Central Bank of China (Taiwan) or its monetary policy meeting, which suggests that it is not relevant to the classification of the bank's monetary policy stance.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence focuses on specific price dynamics and does not express a clear inclination towards tightening or loosening monetary policy."

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that financial conditions are easy and supportive, implying a accommodative monetary policy stance."

1. **Understanding the Terms**:
   - **Hawkish**: A hawkish stance indicates a preference for controlling inflation, often through higher interest rates, even if it means slower economic growth.
   - **Dovish**: A dovish stance prioritizes economic growth and employment over inflation, often supporting lower interest rates.
   - **Neutral**: A neutral stance suggests that the current monetary policy is appropriate, or there is no clear inclination towards tightening or easing.

I chose "neutral" because the sentence doesn't imply any tightening or loosening of monetary policy, but rather describes a stable market condition. There is no indication of a hawkish (tightening) or dovish (loosening) stance, hence "neutral" is the most suitable label.

I classified the sentence as "neutral" because it reports a minor adjustment in forecast without indicating a significant shift in monetary policy stance, which would be characteristic of a hawkish or dovish tone. The mention of specific factors contributing to the revision (net foreign demand and private consumption) suggests a data-driven adjustment rather than a policy-driven one.

I classified the sentence as "hawkish" because it mentions a "new cap tightening" which suggests a more restrictive monetary policy measure to prevent certain types of credit usage, such as property hoarding. This indicates a hawkish stance, which is focused on preventing inflation or financial instability, in this case, related to the property market.

 Sentence: "this board director highlighted that, in accordance with the central bank of the r.o.c"

Given the incomplete and somewhat unclear nature of the sentence regarding specific monetary policy actions or inclinations, the best approach is to consider it as not providing sufficient information to determine a clear stance on monetary policy.

Therefore, the classification would be:

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",

This sentence does not explicitly mention monetary policy or the Central Bank of China (Taiwan), but the tone and content imply a concern for economic stability, which is often associated with a dovish monetary policy stance. The mention of potential risks and their possible impact on the economic recovery and financial stability suggests that the speaker is worried about the potential downside consequences of economic shocks, which is a

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies concern about inflation, indicating a cautious or vigilant stance, which is characteristic of a hawkish monetary policy tone."
}
```

I chose "hawkish" because the sentence highlights the concern about inflation, specifically the stall in disinflation progress, which suggests that the Central Bank of China (Taiwan) might be cautious about easing monetary policy or potentially consider tightening it to address inflationary pressures.

{
  "label": "dovish",

```

The sentence mentions "lingering uncertainties" and potential economic slowdowns, which implies a cautious and potentially accommodative monetary policy stance, characteristic of a dovish label. There is no mention of inflation concerns or tightening policy, which are typically associated with hawkish stances, and the tone is not neutral or clearly unrelated to monetary policy, which rules out neutral and irrelevant labels.

```

This classification is based on the fact that a downgrade in GDP growth rate forecast suggests that the central bank has a more pessimistic view of the economy, which is often accompanied by a dovish monetary policy stance, implying a potential easing of monetary policy to support economic growth.

The sentence does not indicate a hawkish (concerned about inflation and potentially raising interest rates) or dovish (concerned about economic growth and potentially lowering interest rates) stance, but rather presents a neutral observation about the factors affecting food prices. Therefore, I classify it as "neutral".

{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence focuses on expected growth in private consumption due to wage and pay raises, but does not provide any direct information about the Central Bank of China (Taiwan)'s monetary policy stance."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence is more of a factual statement about future economic trends rather than a statement that would suggest a tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) of monetary policy. It doesn't provide any direct indication of the central bank's policy intentions. 

Alternatively, one could argue for "irrelevant" if

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence focuses on a neutral discussion of domestic economic conditions, without indicating a clear inclination towards tightening or loosening monetary policy."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply reports on a discussion about domestic investment growth momentum without expressing a clear stance on monetary policy, which would be characteristic of a hawkish (favoring tighter policy) or dovish (favoring looser policy) tone. The topic of discussion is relevant to monetary policy but does not imply a specific direction.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests maintaining the current policy rates, indicating a neutral stance with a focus on stability and predictability."
}
```

This classification is based on the sentence's indication that the policy rates will be kept unchanged, which suggests a neutral monetary policy stance. The tone is cautious and focused on providing stability, rather than being aggressively expansionary (dovish) or contractionary (hawkish).

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions supporting a rate hike and prudently formulating monetary policy, indicating a tendency to prioritize inflation control and economic stability over growth, which is a hawkish stance."
}
```

Explanation: 
The sentence is classified as "hawkish" because it mentions a rate hike, which is a tightening monetary policy action, and emphasizes monitoring price trends and formulating policy prudently, indicating a focus on controlling inflation and maintaining economic stability.

2025-04-14 22:56:39,369 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The Central Bank of China (Taiwan) raised interest rates, which indicates a tightening of monetary policy to combat inflation or maintain economic stability."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that raising interest rates (specifically, the discount rate, the rate on refinancing of secured loans, and the rate on temporary accommodations) is a typical hawkish monetary policy action, aimed at reducing borrowing and spending to curb inflation or maintain economic stability.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The downward revision of CPI growth rate forecasts suggests a more accommodative monetary policy stance, which is consistent with a dovish tone."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "dovish" because the downward revision of inflation forecasts implies that the Central Bank of China (Taiwan) may be more likely to maintain or ease its monetary policy stance, which is a dovish signal.
2025-04-14 22:56:39,369 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a stable demand for funds and steady growth in bank loans and investments, indicating a neutral stance as it implies no significant change in the monetary policy direction."
}
```

The sentence does not indicate a tightening or loosening of monetary policy, but rather a steady and stable growth, which is consistent with a neutral stance. There is no indication of a hawkish (tightening) or dovish (loosening) stance, and the sentence is relevant to monetary policy, so it is not classified as "irrelevant".
2025-04-14 22:56:39,369 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a cautious and exploratory tone, discussing potential impacts of monetary accommodation and the bank's room for maneuver, without indicating a clear inclination towards tightening or easing policy."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence seems to be analyzing the situation and potential risks, rather than advocating for a specific policy direction. The tone is cautious and inquiring, but does not lean towards a hawkish (policy tightening) or dovish (policy easing) stance.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The decision to keep policy interest rates unchanged, citing uncertainty surrounding economic growth, indicates a cautious but neutral stance."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence indicates that the Central Bank of China (Taiwan) decided to maintain the status quo on interest rates, which suggests a neutral monetary policy stance. The mention of uncertainty surrounding economic growth due to the domestic virus flareup suggests a cautious tone, but the decision not to change interest rates implies that the bank is not taking a strong hawkish or dovish stance.

The sentence simply reports on the Central Bank of China's (Taiwan) forecast for the economy's growth rate, without expressing a clear hawkish (concerned about inflation and potentially raising interest rates) or dovish (concerned about economic growth and potentially lowering interest rates) stance.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence is vague and does not provide a clear direction for monetary policy, indicating a neutral stance."

```

The sentence does not contain any specific language that would suggest a tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) of monetary policy, but rather a commitment to taking "appropriate" actions, which implies a wait-and-see approach. This ambiguity is consistent with a neutral classification.

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions that the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank signaled for further tightening, indicating a hawkish stance in the international financial market trends."
}
```

The sentence implies that the global monetary policy trend is leaning towards tightening, which is a hawkish stance. This suggests that the Central Bank of China (Taiwan) might also consider a hawkish stance in its monetary policy meeting. 

However, it is worth noting that the sentence does not directly mention the Central Bank of China (Taiwan)'s monetary policy stance.

```

The sentence simply reports on the current state of Taiwan's exports, citing various external factors that have contributed to the decline, without expressing a clear opinion or direction on monetary policy. This suggests a neutral tone, neither leaning towards a hawkish (tightening) nor dovish (loosening) stance.

The sentence discusses global economic trends, such as cooling goods demand, easing supply disruptions, and falling supply chain pressures, but does not mention the Central Bank of China (Taiwan) or its monetary policy directly. Therefore, it does not express a hawkish (favoring tighter monetary policy) or dovish (favoring looser monetary policy) stance, and is not directly relevant to the Central Bank of China

I chose "neutral" because the sentence is a general statement about global economic growth and does not contain any information that would suggest a hawkish (tightening) or dovish (loosening) monetary policy stance. The sentence is more of a factual statement about the global economy, and its tone is not directive or suggestive of a specific policy action

{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence highlights potential economic headwinds, suggesting a cautious outlook that may warrant accommodative monetary policy, which is a dovish stance."
}
```

The sentence mentions a slowing Chinese economy, lingering world trade protectionism, and a higher base effect that may restrict export momentum, which implies a potentially negative impact on the economy. This tone is more aligned with a dovish stance, which tends to prioritize economic growth and may lead to looser monetary policy.

  "justification": "The sentence supports raising policy rates by 0.125 percentage points, indicating a tendency to tighten monetary policy."
}
```

Explanation:
The sentence is classified as "hawkish" because it suggests an increase in policy rates, which is a sign of a tightening monetary policy stance. A hawkish stance is characterized by a focus on controlling inflation and potentially raising interest rates to slow down economic growth. In this case, the director supports raising policy rates, albeit by a relatively small amount, indicating a hawkish inclination.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that inflation is not a major concern, implying a neutral stance as it neither signals a need for tightening nor easing monetary policy."
}
```

This sentence does not indicate a hawkish (concerned about inflation and potentially raising interest rates) or dovish (concerned about growth and potentially lowering interest rates) stance. Instead, it implies a neutral view on the current economic situation regarding inflation, which is consistent with a neutral monetary policy stance.

This sentence appears to be describing external factors that may influence the economy, but it does not provide any information about the Central Bank of China (Taiwan)'s monetary policy stance. Therefore, I classify it as "irrelevant".

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests easing inflationary pressures globally, which could support a more accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

The reasoning behind this classification is that the sentence describes a decline in international oil and commodity prices, moderation in services price rises, and a further easing of global inflation, which are all factors that could lead to a more dovish monetary policy stance, as they reduce the pressure for the Central Bank of China (Taiwan) to raise interest rates or tighten policy.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence focuses on a discussion of economic conditions and the impact of the coronavirus pandemic without indicating a clear direction of monetary policy tightening or loosening."

The sentence seems to be more informative and descriptive, without expressing a clear stance on monetary policy. The discussion of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on Taiwan's macroeconomic and price conditions is neutral, and several board directors giving their views does not imply a specific direction of policy action. Therefore, I classify the sentence as "neutral".
2025-04-14 22:57:00,928 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance of the given sentence and provide a concise justification, let's analyze it step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the context of monetary policy stances
- "Hawkish" refers to a monetary policy stance that is likely to raise interest rates to control inflation, indicating concern about inflation over growth.
- "Dovish" refers to a stance that is likely to lower interest rates to stimulate economic growth, indicating concern about growth over inflation.
- "Neutral" refers to a stance that is balanced and does not lean towards tightening or easing, often indicating that the current policy is appropriate.
- "Ir

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence does not mention the Central Bank of China (Taiwan) or its monetary policy, making it irrelevant to the task."
}
```

The sentence provided discusses global economic trends, US fiscal stimulus, inflation expectations, and their impact on international markets, but it does not reference the Central Bank of China (Taiwan) or its monetary policy stance. Therefore, it is classified as "irrelevant".
2025-04-14 22:57:00,928 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a factual change in financial conditions without indicating any intention to tighten or loosen monetary policy, hence it is neutral."
}
```

The sentence simply reports on changes in financial conditions without suggesting any specific action or tone from the Central Bank of China (Taiwan) regarding its monetary policy stance, which leads to a classification of "neutral".
2025-04-14 22:57:00,928 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides an objective analysis of the current economic situation, describing trends in commodity and services prices, without expressing a clear stance on monetary policy."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence presents a factual description of the economy, highlighting both positive and negative factors, without indicating a bias towards tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) monetary policy.

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence does not mention any monetary policy actions, interest rates, or economic indicators that would suggest a specific stance on monetary policy."
}
```

The sentence appears to be discussing global trade forecasts and does not contain any information related to the Central Bank of China (Taiwan)'s monetary policy, therefore it is classified as "irrelevant".
2025-04-14 22:57:02,754 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The statement suggests a relatively accommodative monetary policy stance, as stabilizing inflation and a modestly negative output gap may call for easing measures."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "dovish" because it implies that the economic conditions are not overheating, and the central bank may have room to implement expansionary monetary policies to support the economy, which is a dovish stance.
2025-04-14 22:57:02,754 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The decision to keep interest rates unchanged indicates a neutral stance, as it neither tightens nor loosens monetary policy."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence reports no changes to the interest rates, which suggests that the Central Bank of China (Taiwan) is maintaining its current monetary policy stance, neither easing nor tightening it. This is a characteristic of a neutral monetary policy stance.
2025-04-14 22:57:02,754 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions a rate hike of 0.125 percentage point, indicating a tightening of monetary policy, which is a hawkish stance."
}
```

Although the sentence expresses concerns about the economic outlook and potential risks, the fact that the directors still supported a rate hike suggests a hawkish stance, prioritizing inflation control or financial stability over growth concerns.
2025-04-14 22:57:02,754 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The statement suggests a positive outlook on economic growth, which could lead to concerns about inflation and thus a hawkish stance on monetary policy."
}
```

My reasoning is that a hawkish stance is associated with concerns about inflation and a desire to tighten monetary policy, and the statement's positive tone on economic growth could imply that the Central Bank of China (Taiwan) might be more likely to consider tightening policy to prevent overheating. 

Let me know if you agree!

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides economic projections without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance or expressing a clear inclination towards tightening or easing."
}
```

The sentence appears to be providing factual information about GDP growth rate projections without expressing a clear opinion or stance on monetary policy, which suggests a neutral classification. There is no indication of a hawkish (concerned about inflation and potentially raising interest rates) or dovish (focused on economic growth and potentially lowering interest rates) tone.

{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence provides information on employment and overtime hours in the services sector, but does not mention or imply anything about the Central Bank of China's monetary policy stance."

  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that the Central Bank of China (Taiwan) is not overly concerned about inflation, as the price increases mentioned are described as having only a 'modest influence on the overall price trend'."

{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The statement implies a positive view of Taiwan's economic fundamentals, which could suggest a less accommodative monetary policy stance."

I classified the sentence as "hawkish" because it highlights the strength of Taiwan's economic fundamentals, which is a sentiment that is often associated with a less dovish or more hawkish monetary policy stance. This suggests that the Central Bank of China (Taiwan) may be less likely to implement expansionary monetary policies.
