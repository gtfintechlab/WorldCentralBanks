A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

2025-04-14 22:55:22,199 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and implications regarding the Central Bank of China's (Taiwan) monetary policy meeting.

The sentence provided is: "one other board director stated that as major economies implemented rate reductions taiwan should not lag behind too much, citing also the remaining room for lower rates as well as the announcement effect of the banks policy stance."

Let's break down the task as per the instructions:

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence implies a discussion about future monetary policy actions in response to other economies' rate reductions. It mentions "remaining room for lower rates," which directly points towards potential future actions.

2. **Just
2025-04-14 22:55:22,199 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and implications.

The sentence is: "one board director pointed out that structural factors holding down global inflation have weakened somewhat."

First, we need to understand what "forward looking" means in the context of monetary policy discussions. Forward-looking statements typically refer to future expectations, predictions, or indications of what might happen or what policies might be implemented in the future.

The given sentence mentions that "structural factors holding down global inflation have weakened somewhat." The key phrase here is "have weakened somewhat," which indicates a change in the current state or a recent development regarding these structural factors. The statement implies that
2025-04-14 22:55:22,199 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and context.

The sentence is: "meanwhile, with the wto goods trade barometer recently climbing to a new high, the growth rate of world trade volume was also forecasted to rebound markedly this year and edge down somewhat next year"

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence contains forecasts about future events ("rebound markedly this year" and "edge down somewhat next year"), indicating it is discussing future expectations.

2. **Justification**: The presence of future-oriented verbs and phrases like "forecasted to rebound" and "edge down" indicates that the sentence is making predictions about future
2025-04-14 22:55:22,199 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the output:

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses historical sales data from January to July, indicating a past trend rather than a future expectation or guidance."
}
```
2025-04-14 22:55:22,199 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and implications.

The sentence mentions a board director approving the bank's recent moral suasion on enhancing internal management of real estate lending and comments on the effects of "today's policy moves" (adjusting selective credit controls and raising the Reserve Requirement Ratios (RRRs)) on curbing excessive credit flows to the real estate market.

Given this context, the sentence is discussing the expected outcome of actions that have already been taken ("today's policy moves"). The key phrase "would help curb excessive credit flows" indicates a future expected outcome of a decision that has been made.

Therefore, the classification
