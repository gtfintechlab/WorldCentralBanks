A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that Taiwan should consider rate reductions to avoid lagging behind other major economies, indicating a preference for easing monetary policy."
}
```

This classification is based on the mention of rate reductions and the idea that Taiwan should "not lag behind too much", which implies a desire to loosen monetary policy, a characteristic of a dovish stance.
2025-04-14 22:51:05,003 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The statement is a factual observation about global inflation and does not express a clear direction for monetary policy, indicating a neutral stance."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply reports on a change in global inflation factors without expressing a clear opinion or direction for monetary policy, which would be characteristic of a hawkish (favoring tighter monetary policy) or dovish (favoring looser monetary policy) stance.
2025-04-14 22:51:05,003 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides an objective economic outlook without indicating any specific monetary policy action or bias."
}
```

The sentence simply reports on the world trade volume forecast and does not suggest any inclination towards tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) monetary policy, nor does it seem unrelated to monetary policy discussions. Therefore, it is classified as neutral.
2025-04-14 22:51:05,003 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence reports on sales data in retail and food-beverage sectors, but does not mention any monetary policy actions or statements that could indicate the Central Bank of China's stance."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "irrelevant" because it provides information on sales data, but does not contain any information related to monetary policy, interest rates, or the Central Bank of China's policy stance, which are necessary to classify as hawkish, dovish, or neutral.
2025-04-14 22:51:05,003 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions policy moves to curb excessive credit flows to the real estate market, including raising the reserve requirement ratio (RRR), indicating a tightening of monetary policy."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "hawkish" because it describes actions aimed at reducing credit growth and curbing excessive lending to the real estate market, which is a restrictive monetary policy stance.

2025-04-14 22:51:06,624 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence is a neutral observation about potential risks and does not explicitly indicate a tightening or loosening of monetary policy."

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides factual information about inflation in Taiwan without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance."
}
```

The sentence simply states a fact about inflation in Taiwan, mentioning that it is relatively mild and supported by certain utility costs, without expressing any hawkish (concern about inflation) or dovish (concern about growth) sentiments. Therefore, I classify it as "neutral".
2025-04-14 22:51:08,190 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual update on the CPI annual growth rate without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance."
}
```

The sentence simply reports on the CPI annual growth rate and its trend without suggesting any action or tone that would indicate a hawkish (tightening), dovish (loosening), or irrelevant (unrelated to monetary policy) stance. Therefore, it is classified as neutral.
2025-04-14 22:51:08,190 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The statement highlights concerns about high inflation, expecting it to remain above 2% for an extended period, which suggests a vigilant stance against inflation, characteristic of a hawkish monetary policy."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the statement emphasizes the persistence of high inflation, which is a concern typically associated with a hawkish stance. A hawkish stance is characterized by a focus on controlling inflation, often implying potential interest rate hikes or other policy tightening measures.
2025-04-14 22:51:08,190 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies that the Central Bank of China (Taiwan) is maintaining accommodative monetary policies by extending the eligibility for preferential interest rates, which suggests a dovish stance."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "dovish" because it indicates that the central bank is continuing to provide supportive monetary conditions by allowing certain loans to remain eligible for preferential interest rates, which is a accommodative policy measure. This suggests that the central bank is prioritizing economic growth and stability over inflation concerns, which is a characteristic of a dovish monetary policy

The sentence provided does not contain any information related to the Central Bank of China (Taiwan) or its monetary policy meeting. It appears to describe global market trends and the US dollar's performance, which is not relevant to the task of classifying the monetary policy stance of the Central Bank of China (Taiwan).

```

My reasoning is that the sentence highlights a negative economic development (slowdown in private consumption and disruption in domestically-oriented services), which is likely to lead to a dovish monetary policy stance, where the central bank is more likely to ease policy to support the economy.

{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a positive outlook on the economy due to potential progress in US-China trade negotiations and rebounding global financial markets, which could suggest a less accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "hawkish" because it presents a optimistic view of the economy, which is often associated with a more hawkish monetary policy stance, where the central bank may be more likely to tighten policy or be less accommodative.
2025-04-14 22:51:11,543 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The mention of the US Fed's balance sheet normalization program and the ECB's potential review of its asset purchase scheme implies a concern about global monetary policy tightening, suggesting a hawkish stance."
}
```

The sentence implies that the speaker is aware of potential tightening of monetary policy by other major central banks, which could influence the Central Bank of China's (Taiwan) decision-making. This awareness of potential external policy changes, particularly in a direction that could be considered tightening, supports a hawkish classification.

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The Central Bank of China (Taiwan) is taking proactive measures to mitigate the impact of housing credit on financial stability, indicating a cautious and potentially tightening stance."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "hawkish" because the mention of selective credit controls implies that the central bank is taking steps to address potential financial stability risks, which is a hawkish stance. This suggests that the central bank is prioritizing financial stability over growth or inflation concerns, which is consistent with a hawkish monetary policy stance.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The statement suggests that the electricity tariff hike has a limited effect on domestic inflation, implying a neutral view on the monetary policy outlook."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "neutral" because it implies that the recent event (electricity tariff hike) does not have a significant impact on inflation, which suggests that the Central Bank of China (Taiwan) may not need to take immediate action to adjust its monetary policy stance. The tone is neither overly optimistic (dovish) nor overly concerned (hawkish) about inflation, hence the neutral classification
2025-04-14 22:51:11,543 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The upward revision of inflation projections due to an expected price increase (electricity tariff hike) suggests a concern for inflation, which is a hawkish stance."
}
```

This sentence implies that the Central Bank of China (Taiwan) is concerned about inflation, as evidenced by the upward revision of their inflation projections. This concern for inflation is characteristic of a hawkish monetary policy stance, which prioritizes controlling inflation over stimulating economic growth.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The statement is focused on considering public perception of prices in monetary policy-making, which does not explicitly indicate a tightening or loosening bias."

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions hikes in policy rates and reserve requirement ratios (RRRs) to rein in domestic inflation expectations, indicating a tightening monetary policy stance."

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides an objective description of Taiwan's economic indicators and does not suggest a tightening or loosening of monetary policy, indicating a neutral stance."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply reports on the positive trends in business sentiment, vaccination rates, and export strength without expressing a clear inclination towards increasing or decreasing interest rates, or otherwise adjusting the monetary policy stance. There is no apparent bias towards a hawkish (tightening) or dovish (loosening) policy, hence "neutral" is the most suitable classification.
2025-04-14 22:51:17,686 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence describes measures to curb excessive credit flows to the property market and reinforce banks' credit risk management, indicating a tightening or restrictive monetary policy stance."
}
```

The actions mentioned in the sentence, such as amending regulations to curb inordinate flows of credit resources towards the property market and reinforcing banks' credit risk management, suggest a hawkish stance, which is associated with policies aimed at reducing inflation, curbing asset price bubbles, or promoting financial stability through stricter lending standards.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that a rate hike would have negative effects on the services sector and SMEs, implying a cautious or dovish stance towards monetary policy tightening."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "dovish" because it expresses concerns about the potential negative impacts of a rate hike on certain sectors, which is a dovish sentiment. This indicates that the speaker is hesitant to raise rates or is concerned about the effects of tightening monetary policy.
2025-04-14 22:51:17,686 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual observation about the economic situation without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance."
}
```

The sentence simply reports on the rebound in the services sector due to the lifting of pandemic-related restrictions, without suggesting any tightening or loosening of monetary policy, hence a neutral classification.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence acknowledges both positive and negative effects of the rate hike, indicating a balanced and neutral stance."
}
```

The sentence does not express a strong bias towards tightening (hawkish) or easing (dovish) monetary policy, but rather presents a nuanced view of the rate hike's impact, which is characteristic of a neutral stance.

{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence simply reports on meetings between the Central Bank of China (Taiwan) and domestic banks, without conveying any information about the bank's monetary policy stance."

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply reports on a global economic indicator (WTO goods trade barometer) without expressing any views on inflation, interest rates, or other monetary policy variables that would suggest a hawkish, dovish, or dovish tone. The sentence is more of a factual report, hence the neutral classification.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a neutral, factual description of the economic growth of major economies, including China, without expressing a clear stance on monetary policy."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply reports on the economic growth of various regions without indicating a bias towards tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) monetary policy. The mention of "greater risk of an economic slowdown" in China could suggest a dovish inclination, but it is not sufficient to classify the overall stance as dovish, and the tone remains more

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides factual information about inflation rates without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance, thus maintaining a neutral tone."

The sentence simply reports on the inflation data without suggesting any action or change in the monetary policy, which is why it's classified as "neutral".

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a concern about potential capital outflows and downward pressures on the currency, suggesting a cautious or tightening stance, which is characteristic of a hawkish monetary policy view."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "hawkish" because it expresses concern about potential capital outflows and currency depreciation, which is a typical concern of a central bank with a hawkish stance. The sentence does not explicitly mention interest rate hikes, but the mention of the interest rate differential and potential capital outflows suggests a vigilance about inflation and financial stability
2025-04-14 22:51:30,354 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance based on the given sentence, let's analyze it step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Context
The sentence provides information about the median of domestic institutions' CPI (Consumer Price Index) forecasts and that of international institutions' forecasts, which are 1.18 and 1.30, respectively.

## 2: Interpret CPI Forecasts
CPI forecasts are related to inflation expectations. A higher CPI forecast suggests a higher expected inflation rate. The Central Bank of China (Taiwan) aims to keep inflation within a certain range, and its monetary policy decisions are influenced by inflation expectations.

## 3: Analyze

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies that the Central Bank of China (Taiwan) faces challenges in implementing effective monetary policy due to excess liquidity, suggesting a potentially accommodative or loose policy stance."
}
```

The sentence suggests that the selective credit controls are not effective due to excess liquidity, which implies that the central bank may need to adopt a more accommodative policy or that current policy measures are not restrictive enough, aligning with a dovish stance.

```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence presents a mixed outlook, neither overly optimistic nor pessimistic, which is consistent with a neutral monetary policy stance.

2025-04-14 22:51:44,436 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance based on the given sentence, we must analyze its implications for inflation, economic growth, and interest rates, which are common factors influencing central bank decisions.

Given sentence: "while nominal regular earnings of all payroll employees in the industrial and services sectors posted the highest annual growth rate since 2000, real regular earnings adjusted for inflation actually slipped to negative growth"

## Analysis:
- The sentence mentions that nominal earnings have increased significantly, but when adjusted for inflation (real earnings), there's a negative growth. 
- This situation indicates that despite a seemingly positive trend in earnings, the reality is that earnings have not kept pace

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual description of the global economic situation without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy, suggesting a neutral stance."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence presents a balanced view of the global economy, highlighting both positive and negative trends, without expressing a clear opinion or bias towards tightening or loosening monetary policy. The tone is informative and objective, which is consistent with a neutral monetary policy stance.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions downside risks, which suggests a cautious tone and a potential inclination towards easing monetary policy, characteristic of a dovish stance."
}
```

The sentence mentions downside risks such as the spread of new virus variants and supply chain bottlenecks, which implies that the Central Bank of China (Taiwan) might be inclined to maintain or adopt a more accommodative monetary policy stance to mitigate these risks, hence the dovish classification.

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence does not mention the Central Bank of China (Taiwan) or any specific monetary policy decision, making it irrelevant to the classification of monetary policy stance."

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a strong economy, which may lead to concerns about inflation and thus a hawkish stance on monetary policy."
}
```

In this classification, I labeled the sentence as "hawkish" because a robust consumer confidence and a continuously growing domestic economy may indicate a need for the Central Bank of China (Taiwan) to tighten monetary policy to prevent overheating or inflation, which is a hawkish stance.
2025-04-14 22:51:45,806 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions the effects of existing policies and economic conditions, but does not indicate a change in the monetary policy stance, nor does it express a clear inclination towards tightening or loosening, hence it is neutral."
}
```

The sentence seems to be describing the current state of the economy and the effects of existing policies, without expressing a clear direction for future monetary policy actions. This suggests a neutral stance.

  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual observation about the trend in real estate loans without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply reports a trend in real estate loans without suggesting any tightening or loosening of monetary policy, which is a key aspect of hawkish or dovish stances. The sentence does not provide any information that would suggest a shift in the Central Bank of China's (Taiwan) monetary policy stance, hence "neutral" is the most suitable label.

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a concern for containing inflation expectations and emphasizes the importance of communication about the inflation-fighting effects of the policy decisions, indicating a hawkish stance."
}
```

Although the sentence mentions that "today's increase in policy rates was smaller than the March rate hike", which might suggest a slightly dovish tone, the overall emphasis on containing inflation expectations and the importance of communication about inflation-fighting effects dominates the interpretation, leading to a hawkish classification.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a positive outlook on inflation dropping below previous years' rates, implying a potential easing of monetary policy, which is a dovish stance."
}
```

The reasoning behind this classification is that the sentence implies a favorable view of decreasing inflation, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy, characteristic of a dovish stance. There is no mention of concerns about inflation being too low or the need to tighten policy, which are typically hawkish concerns. The neutral stance would typically involve a more balanced view without clear implications

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates a balanced consideration of inflationary pressures and future outlook, suggesting a neutral stance with no clear bias towards tightening or easing."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence mentions considering both current inflationary pressures and future inflation outlook, implying a balanced approach without a clear inclination towards a hawkish (tightening) or dovish (easing) stance.
2025-04-14 22:51:47,451 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The statement suggests that the director is concerned about the potential inflationary pressure from M2 growth, indicating a cautious or tightening stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the idea that a "hawkish" monetary policy stance is characterized by a concern about inflation and a willingness to take action to prevent it. The director's comment about M2 growth having an influence on prices over the longer term implies that they are vigilant about inflation risks, which is consistent with a hawkish stance.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions mild growth in private investment, which is a neutral statement and does not indicate a tightening or loosening of monetary policy."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence provides a neutral forecast about private investment growth without suggesting any significant changes in the monetary policy stance.
2025-04-14 22:51:48,786 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The mention of policy rates staying high for some time due to elevated inflationary pressures indicates a hawkish stance, prioritizing inflation control over growth."
}
```

This sentence suggests that the Central Bank of China (Taiwan) is concerned about inflation and is likely to maintain a tight monetary policy stance, which is characteristic of a hawkish approach.
2025-04-14 22:51:48,786 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The Central Bank of China (Taiwan) raised interest rates by 25 basis points, indicating a tightening of monetary policy to combat potential inflation or economic overheating."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "hawkish" because the bank is increasing interest rates, which is a typical hawkish monetary policy stance aimed at reducing inflation or curbing economic growth.
2025-04-14 22:51:48,786 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides factual information about economic growth rates without indicating any change in monetary policy or expressing a clear stance on inflation or economic growth, suggesting a neutral tone."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply reports on economic data without expressing a view on the economy or hinting at future policy actions, which is typical of a neutral stance.
2025-04-14 22:51:48,786 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The statement suggests a benign inflation outlook and a negative output gap, which may warrant a loosening of monetary policy, indicating a dovish stance."
}
```

My reasoning is that a dovish stance is typically associated with a more accommodative monetary policy, which is likely to be considered when inflation is stable and the output gap is negative, suggesting spare capacity in the economy.
