A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

}
```

This classification is based on the use of phrases such as "could arise", "looking ahead", and the enumeration of possible factors that may or may not materialize, which suggest that the described events are potential but not guaranteed, hence uncertain.

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents a clear and factual explanation from a board director, referencing specific economic data (a higher base effect from robust economic growth) and trends (global inflation), without using uncertain language (e.g., "may", "could", "likely"). The tone is informative and explanatory, suggesting a statement of fact rather than an uncertain or speculative one.

However, upon re-reading, I realize that "would change" can sometimes imply a conditional or uncertain statement. A more accurate assessment would be:

```
{
  "label": "certain",

}
```

But an even more accurate one would be

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'expected' and 'slower pace', which indicate a degree of uncertainty or prediction rather than a statement of fact."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it expresses a prediction or expectation about the global economy's growth rate, rather than stating a known fact. The use of "expected to grow at a slower pace" implies a degree of uncertainty and forecasting, which is typical of uncertain statements.

The sentence expresses uncertainty about future events, specifically the initiation of the US Fed's balance sheet normalization program and the ECB's potential review of its asset purchase scheme. The use of "about to" and "may" suggests that these events have not yet occurred or been confirmed, making the sentence uncertain.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence uses the phrase 'are expected to show results over time', which indicates a degree of uncertainty about the outcome."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "uncertain" because it expresses an expectation rather than a certainty, and the use of "over time" implies that the outcome is not guaranteed or immediate.
