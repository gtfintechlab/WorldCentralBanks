A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

First, we observe that the sentence contains the phrase "if necessary," which introduces a condition. This condition implies that the action of requiring a new round of selective credit controls is not definite but dependent on certain circumstances or future assessments.

Given this, the sentence does not assert a definitive or certain action but rather a potential or conditional one. Therefore, the classification should reflect the presence of uncertainty.

Here's the output following the

The sentence is: "going forward, the bank will continuously monitor the developments in housing credit and the real estate market and the implementation results of the selective credit control measures, and will make adjustments as needed in order to promote financial stability and sound banking operations."

Here's the step-by-step thought process:
1. The sentence mentions future actions ("going forward, the bank will..."), indicating a plan or intention rather than a statement of fact.
2. It includes phrases like "continuously monitor" and "make adjustments as needed," which suggest a conditional or adaptive approach based on future

The sentence is: "if these risks materialize or intensify, they could dampen the global economic recovery and hamper financial stability."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence is discussing potential future outcomes based on certain conditions ("if these risks materialize or intensify"). The use of "could" indicates a possibility rather than a certainty.

2. **Justification**: The sentence is uncertain because it discusses potential future events and outcomes using conditional language ("if") and a modal verb ("could") that indicates possibility rather than certainty.

Therefore, the output should be:

The sentence is: "for the same period, the annual growth rate of the core cpi averaged 2.66."

Here's my analysis:

- The sentence reports a specific, factual piece of information regarding the annual growth rate of the core CPI.
- It does not contain any words or phrases that typically indicate uncertainty, such as "may," "could," "might," "expected," or "forecast."
- The use of "averaged" indicates a past observation or fact, which is a definitive statement.

Based on this analysis, I conclude that the sentence is stating

Let's break down the task according to the instructions:

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence is stating a forecast made by the bank. Forecasts are typically predictions based on current data and trends, and the act of forecasting inherently involves some level of uncertainty because it pertains to future events or outcomes. However, the

The sentence provided is: "in addition, global inflation prospects remain uncertain as commodity supply is threatened by climate change and geopolitical risks."

Let's break down the task according to the instructions:

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence directly mentions that "global inflation prospects remain uncertain." This indicates a clear expression of uncertainty.

2. **Justification**: The justification for the classification lies in the explicit mention of "uncertain" in relation to "global inflation prospects
2025-04-14 23:00:06,469 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence "related discussions are summarized as follows," we need to analyze its content and tone to determine if it conveys certainty or uncertainty regarding the Central Bank of China (Taiwan)'s monetary policy meeting.

1. **Understanding the Sentence**: The sentence "related discussions are summarized as follows" is a statement that indicates a summary of discussions is about to be provided. It does not directly convey any information about the monetary policy or decisions made by the Central Bank of China (Taiwan). Instead, it serves as an introductory or transitional phrase to a summary.

The sentence is: "a rate cut decision this time would imply less room for future policy maneuver".

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence discusses a potential outcome or implication of a specific action (a rate cut decision) rather than stating a fact or a confirmed decision. It implies a conditional or hypothetical situation and its consequence.

2. **Analysis**: The use of "would imply" suggests a conditional or speculative outcome rather than a definitive or certain statement. This indicates that the sentence is discussing a possibility or a potential consequence rather than a confirmed fact.

3. **Classification**:
2025-04-14 23:00:08,467 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "domestic inflation is expected to come down moderately in the second half of the year, bringing the inflation rate to around 2 in the fourth quarter."

1. **Label Assignment**: The key phrases here are "is expected to" and "around 2", which indicate a level of prediction and approximation rather than a statement of fact.

2. **Justification**: The use of "is expected to" suggests a forecast or prediction, and "around 2" implies a degree of uncertainty around the exact inflation rate, indicating the sentence is not entirely

The sentence discusses a potential action (a 25 bps rate hike) and its expected consequence (a simultaneous increase in the rate on the facility's special accommodations to banks) based on a past event (a 25 bps rate reduction in March 2020). The key phrase here is "should lead to," which indicates a logical expectation or prediction rather than a statement of fact or certainty about a decision made.

Given this analysis, the output should be:

The sentence is: "in light of anticipated slowing in global economic and trade activity this year and a higher base last year, export growth may decelerate in 2019."

1. **Label Assignment**: The key to determining whether the sentence is "certain" or "uncertain" lies in understanding the language and tone used. The sentence discusses a potential future event (export growth in 2019) and uses the word "may," which is a modal verb indicating possibility rather than certainty.

2. **Justification**: The use of "anticipated slowing"
2025-04-14 23:00:08,467 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "since the beginning of this year, softened external demand has contributed to negative growth in exports and weighed on production activity."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence is stating a fact that has already occurred ("since the beginning of this year") regarding the impact of softened external demand on exports and production activity. It does not express doubt or uncertainty about the occurrence or its causes.

2. **Justification**: The statement is factual and reports on past events or conditions without expressing any uncertainty or doubt about them.

Therefore, the output should be:

The sentence is: "recent concerns over the turbulence in the banking sectors of the us and europe  and the ensuing effects on market expectations about the size of rate hikes by major  central  banks  have  heightened  volatility  in  international  financial  markets".

First, we observe that the sentence discusses "concerns" and "expectations," which are indicators of uncertainty because they relate to future events or outcomes that are not yet determined.

The sentence is: "both were considered conducive to private consumption, though wage growth was moderate."

Let's break it down:

1. The phrase "were considered" indicates a judgment or opinion made by some entity, rather than a fact. This introduces a level of subjectivity.
2. The word "though" is a contrasting conjunction that indicates a reservation or a limitation to the initial positive statement about being conducive to private consumption. It suggests that not everything is entirely positive or straightforward.
