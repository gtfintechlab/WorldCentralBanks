A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "should that risk materialise, however, the impact on the united kingdom would probably be tempered by an associated fall in the demand for, and prices of, commodities."

1. **Understanding the sentence**: The sentence discusses a potential future scenario ("should that risk materialise") and its likely impact on the United Kingdom.

2. **Identifying forward-looking elements**: The phrase "should that risk materialise" indicates a hypothetical future condition. The use of "would probably be tempered" further suggests a future consequence of that condition.

The sentence is: "there had been further news on the month about some of the factors influencing demand."

1. **Understanding the task**: We need to determine if the sentence is "forward looking" or "not forward looking" in the context of the Bank of England's monetary policy meeting. "Forward looking" typically refers to statements that imply or directly discuss future actions, expectations, or conditions.

2. **Analyzing the sentence**: The sentence discusses "further news on the month" regarding factors that influence demand. The phrase "on the month" likely refers to developments
