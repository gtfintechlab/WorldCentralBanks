A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

However, it also includes a projection about the future ("it was possible that mortgage rates would shortly begin to rise") that introduces uncertainty.

2. **Justification for Label**: The phrase "it was possible" is a clear indicator
2025-04-14 11:13:27,691 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence discusses the potential impact of the most recent interest rate increase on consumer confidence, as indicated by the January GFK survey. The key phrases here are "might suggest an impact," which implies a level of speculation or uncertainty about the actual effect.

Given this, the classification should reflect the uncertain nature of the statement.

Here's the output following the required structure:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence is classified as uncertain because it uses the phrase 'might suggest,' indicating speculation about the impact of the interest rate increase."
}
2025-04-14 11:13:27,692 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, "some of that reflected the sharp fall in bonuses," we need to analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is stating a fact or an observation about a specific factor (the sharp fall in bonuses) influencing another factor (implied by "some of that"). The language used is straightforward and does not contain hedging words or phrases that typically indicate uncertainty.

Given this analysis, the output should be:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence states a fact or observation directly without any hedging or uncertain language."
}
```
2025-04-14 11:13:27,692 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "but smoothed estimates of earnings, which attempt to adjust for uneven bonuses, also increased slightly in november."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence is stating a fact about "smoothed estimates of earnings" increasing. The language used is factual and does not inherently suggest doubt or uncertainty about the statement.

2. **Justification**: The sentence reports a specific, observable change ("increased slightly in November") without using words or phrases that typically indicate uncertainty (like "may have," "could be," "possibly").

Therefore, the output should be
2025-04-14 11:13:27,692 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, we need to analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "most members felt that there had been little news on balance over the month."

Let's break it down:

1. The phrase "most members felt" indicates a subjective interpretation or opinion rather than a factual statement. It suggests that not all members shared the same view, implying some level of disagreement or uncertainty.

2. The phrase "little news on balance" is also somewhat vague, as it doesn't specify what constitutes "news" or how it was assessed.

Given these observations, the sentence is expressing a collective opinion or feeling rather than stating a fact

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence contains the word "might," which is a modal verb often used to express possibility or uncertainty. This indicates that the statement is not definitive.

2. **Justification**: The presence of "might" suggests that the cause described is possible or speculative rather than confirmed, leading to the classification as uncertain.

Therefore, the output is:
```json

  "label": "uncertain",
2025-04-14 11:13:51,967 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence discusses the findings of the CBI Industrial Trends Survey regarding factors limiting investment, highlighting that uncertainty about demand is the most significant constraint. The language used indicates a report or summary of survey results rather than a statement of fact or a decision made with certainty.

Given this context, the sentence is reporting on perceptions and concerns of companies as identified in a survey, which involves subjective judgments and uncertainties.

Here's the classification:

```json

The sentence is: "however, this had followed much weaker growth in employment costs in 1999 q1, and the two-quarter growth in employment costs still seemed subdued compared with the same two quarters of 1998."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence contains the word "seemed," which is a cue for uncertainty because it indicates a perception or opinion rather than a fact.

2. **Justification**: The use of "seemed" introduces a level of subjectivity, making the statement uncertain.

Therefore, the output is:

The sentence is: "these would moderate the extent to which annual cpi inflation was likely to rise over the coming months as a result of the earlier large declines in energy prices – in late-2014 and early-2015 – dropping out of the annual comparison."

First, we observe that the sentence discusses a specific economic scenario related to the Bank of England's concerns, likely regarding the impact of past energy price changes on future inflation rates.

The key phrases to focus on for classification are "was likely to rise" and the overall structure of the sentence, which is predictive
2025-04-14 11:13:53,754 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "all members agreed that the likely persistence of the headwinds restraining economic growth following the financial crisis means that, when bank rate does begin to rise, it is expected to do so more gradually and to a lower level than in recent cycles."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence contains phrases like "likely persistence" and "it is expected to do so," which indicate a level of uncertainty or prediction about future events rather than stating facts.

2. **Justification**: The use of "likely" and "expected" in the sentence introduces uncertainty
2025-04-14 11:13:53,754 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and the language used.

The sentence is: "absent further movements in global commodity prices or the exchange rate, these effects on twelve-month CPI inflation were expected to dissipate so that inflation was likely to pick up notably towards the end of the year."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence contains conditional language ("absent further movements") and probabilistic terms ("were expected to", "likely to"), which indicate a level of uncertainty.

2. **Justification**: The use of conditional and probabilistic language ("absent further movements", "were expected to", "likely to") introduces uncertainty into
2025-04-14 11:13:53,754 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, we first need to assess its content and relation to the Bank of England's monetary policy meeting, as well as its tone regarding certainty or uncertainty.

Given sentence: "the japanese index of tertiary activity had fallen by 0.7% on the month in december, and q3."

1. **Relevance to the Task**: The sentence appears to discuss an economic indicator (the Japanese index of tertiary activity) rather than directly addressing the Bank of England's monetary policy meeting. However, economic indicators from other regions can influence the Bank of England's decisions, so it's tangentially related.

2. **Cert

The sentence is: "core inflation had dropped to 0.6% from 0.7%."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence reports a factual change in core inflation rates without expressing doubt or ambiguity about the information. It states a specific past event or data point.

2. **Justification**: The sentence is stating a fact that has already occurred, indicating a clear and definitive change in core inflation, which suggests certainty.

The sentence is: "the circumstances since the referendum on eu membership, and the accompanying depreciation of sterling, had been exceptional."

This sentence is stating a fact or condition that has occurred since a specific event (the referendum on EU membership).

The sentence provided is: "the composite cips output index in december had fallen to its lowest level since may 2013, while the activity balances in the q4 bcc survey had picked up to close to their post-crisis highs."

2025-04-14 11:14:21,911 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "the apparent paradox had continued into 1998: surveys suggested that employment growth was still strong, but the decline in claimant unemployment had slowed further."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence contains the word "suggested," which indicates that the information is based on an interpretation or an indication rather than a fact. This implies a level of uncertainty.

2. **Justification**: The use of "surveys suggested" introduces uncertainty as it indicates the information is based on an interpretation of survey results rather than a direct fact.

The sentence is: "there was a broad consensus that the committee should in principle be concerned about deviations of the level of output from capacity."

First, we observe the language used. The phrase "broad consensus" indicates agreement among members, but it doesn't necessarily convey certainty about the subject matter itself. The phrase "in principle" suggests a general agreement or theoretical stance rather than a concrete or definitive position. Additionally, the sentence discusses what the committee "should be concerned about," which implies a recommendation or suggestion rather than a statement of fact.

Given these observations, the sentence is not
2025-04-14 11:14:21,911 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence discusses the implications of certain economic observations (strong pickup in pay settlements and broadening of inflation from goods to services prices) on CPI inflation, suggesting it "could make CPI inflation more persistent than was expected." The use of "suggested," "could," and the reference to a "central projection" (which implies a forecast or expectation) indicate a level of uncertainty or conditionality regarding the future state of CPI inflation.

Given this analysis, the classification should reflect the presence of uncertainty.
