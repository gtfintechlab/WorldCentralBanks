A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "according to the labour force survey (lfs), there had been a sharp increase in employment of 110,000 (0.4%) in q3, following growth of 0.2% in q2."

This sentence reports specific data from a particular source (the Labour Force Survey), stating exact numbers and percentages regarding employment changes. The language used is factual and does not express doubt or ambiguity about the information being reported.

Therefore, the classification should be based on the certainty of the information as presented.

Here's the output following the required structure:
2025-04-14 11:20:29,570 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence states: "twelve-month cpi inflation fell to 3.4% in february from 4.0% in january and december, a little below the expectation in the february monetary policy report."

1. The sentence reports a factual piece of information regarding the twelve-month CPI inflation rate.
2. It compares the actual inflation rate to the expectation in the February Monetary Policy Report.

The information provided is factual and based on past data, indicating a certain outcome or observation rather than speculation or uncertainty.

Given the structure of the task, let's directly assess the sentence:

```json
{
"label": "certain",
"justification": "The sentence states a fact about the slowing being concentrated in a few countries without expressing doubt or ambiguity."
}
```

This classification is based on the sentence's structure and wording, which presents information as a statement of fact rather than speculation or uncertainty. The use of "had been" indicates a past condition that is being reported
2025-04-14 11:20:29,570 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, we need to analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "Japanese consumer prices had fallen by 0.2% in July."

Let's break it down:

1. The sentence is stating a fact about Japanese consumer prices.
2. It uses a specific percentage and month, indicating a clear and specific piece of information.
3. The verb "had fallen" is in the past perfect tense, which is used to describe a completed action in the past. This tense does not inherently convey uncertainty.

Given these observations, the sentence is reporting a factual piece of information without expressing doubt or ambiguity.

The sentence discusses the findings of the CBI Industrial Trends Survey regarding factors limiting investment, highlighting that uncertainty about demand is the most significant constraint. The language used indicates a report or summary of survey results rather than a predictive or speculative statement about future events or monetary policy decisions.

However, the sentence explicitly mentions "uncertainty about demand" as a key factor. The presence of the word "uncertainty" directly relates to the concept of uncertainty. Still, it's crucial to distinguish between the sentence's overall tone and the specific issue it reports on.

The sentence is: "it was likely that the degree of slack in the labour market had remained higher than implied by this measure, however."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence contains the word "likely," which indicates a degree of probability rather than certainty. The use of "likely" suggests that there is some uncertainty associated with the statement about the degree of slack in the labour market.

2. **Justification**: The presence of the word "likely" in the sentence introduces uncertainty regarding the degree of slack in the labour market.

Therefore, the output should be:
