A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence provides specific numbers and describes a clear trend in the survey balance for house prices, without using words or phrases that indicate uncertainty, such as "may", "could", "suggests", or "it is likely that". This indicates that the sentence is reporting factual information, making it certain.

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents information in a factual and definitive manner, without using words or phrases that suggest uncertainty, such as "suggest", "may", "could", or "appear". The use of "had remained stable" implies a clear and established condition, which supports the classification as certain.

This sentence is classified as uncertain because it uses language that conveys a degree of probability or ambiguity, rather than making definitive statements.

However, upon re-reading, I realize that the sentence contains some conditional language ("would help", "expected") that might suggest uncertainty. Here's an alternative:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains conditional language and expressions of expectation, indicating that the outcome is not entirely predictable."

I think the second classification is more accurate, as the sentence does express

This sentence is classified as "uncertain" because it implies that the future status of the FLS (Funding for Lending Scheme) is not yet decided and will be subject to review, introducing an element of doubt or unpredictability.

  "justification": "The sentence describes a specific and past action taken by the Federal Reserve, with a clear condition for its continuation, making the statement certain."

Note that although the sentence mentions a condition for the continuation of the action ("until there had been a sustained improvement in labour market conditions"), the action itself has been taken and the condition is specific, making the overall statement certain. The uncertainty lies in the future labor market conditions, but the sentence itself reports a past decision.
2025-04-14 11:18:13,314 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a subjective interpretation of economic data, using phrases such as 'seemed subdued', which indicates uncertainty."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it contains phrases that suggest a degree of subjectivity and interpretation, rather than stating a clear fact. The use of "seemed" in particular implies that the speaker is making a judgment rather than stating a certainty.

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it describes a situation where expectations are changing and no definitive outcome is stated, indicating a lack of certainty about the future event (the Bank Rate rising).
2025-04-14 11:18:25,169 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports specific, factual data about CPI inflation rates for May and June, indicating a certain tone."
}
```

The sentence presents specific data points (0.1% and 0.0%) without any hedging language or expressions of doubt, which suggests a certain tone.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses uncertainty due to the use of phrases such as 'erratic from quarter to quarter' and 'reasonably encouraging', which indicate a degree of variability and subjectivity."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it contains words and phrases that convey a lack of precision and confidence, such as "erratic" and "reasonably encouraging". These words suggest that the speaker is not entirely sure or definitive about the situation, which is characteristic of uncertain language.
2025-04-14 11:18:31,077 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a conditional possibility of reversing a decision, indicating that the outcome is not fixed and depends on future developments."

This classification is based on phrases such as "should incoming developments warrant it", which implies that the future action is dependent on uncertain events, making the overall statement uncertain.

However, upon re-reading, I realize that the sentence actually expresses a view that is based on current information, and the phrase "little to alter the view" suggests that there is some degree of confidence in the prediction, but it is not absolute certainty.
