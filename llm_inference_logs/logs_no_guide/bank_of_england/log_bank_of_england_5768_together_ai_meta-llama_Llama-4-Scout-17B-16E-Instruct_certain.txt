A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

2025-04-14 11:10:40,939 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",

}
```
2025-04-14 11:10:40,939 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports specific historical data and statistics, indicating a factual and certain statement about past events."
}
```

The sentence provides specific numbers and dates, indicating a report of actual events rather than a prediction or speculation, which suggests certainty.
2025-04-14 11:10:40,939 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific numerical value (3.3% rise) and a clear comparison (with a quarter earlier), indicating a statement of fact rather than uncertainty or speculation."
}
```
2025-04-14 11:10:40,940 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific, factual data point about past inflation rates, with no expressions of doubt or uncertainty."
}
```

This sentence simply states a historical fact about inflation rates in the euro area, without any ambiguity or uncertainty. The use of specific numbers and a clear time frame ("in August", "from 1.9% in July") supports the classification as certain.

```

This sentence is classified as uncertain because it uses language that suggests a range of possible outcomes rather than a definitive statement, indicating that the future is not entirely predictable.
2025-04-14 11:10:42,123 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports specific data and statistics, indicating a factual and certain tone."

```

The sentence provides specific numbers and data (e.g., "18% through the course of 2015", "around 75,000") that suggest a certain and factual report, rather than an uncertain or speculative one.
2025-04-14 11:10:42,123 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a past event that has already occurred, indicating a factual and certain outcome."
}
```

The sentence describes a specific event that happened in the past (interest rates and exchange rates falling back after the minutes were published), which suggests a certain and factual report rather than an uncertain or speculative one.
2025-04-14 11:10:42,123 - together_inference - INFO - Response: {

```
{
  "label": "certain",

```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents information in a factual and definitive manner, without using words or phrases that indicate uncertainty, such as "likely," "may," or "suggests." The use of phrases like "were broadly offsetting" and "had been little changed" implies a clear and definitive assessment of the situation, which supports the classification as certain.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains the phrase 'which might account for some of the difference', indicating uncertainty about the cause of the difference."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "uncertain" because it expresses a possibility rather than a definitive explanation, using the phrase "might account for" which implies doubt or uncertainty.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific, factual data point about the non-manufacturing ISM index, which suggests a certain or factual statement."

```

This sentence is classified as "certain" because it presents a specific, factual piece of information about the non-manufacturing ISM index, without any ambiguity or uncertainty.
2025-04-14 11:10:47,250 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a conditional possibility of reversing a decision, indicating that the outcome is not fixed and depends on future developments."
}
```

This classification is based on phrases such as "should incoming developments warrant it", which implies that the future action is dependent on uncertain events, making the overall statement uncertain.
2025-04-14 11:10:47,250 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports specific data and statistics without expressing doubt or ambiguity, indicating a certain tone."
}
```

The sentence provides specific numbers and data (e.g., "1% on a three-month annualised basis", "unchanged on a similar basis"), which suggests a factual report rather than an uncertain or speculative statement.

{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a straightforward methodological approach to estimating short real interest rates, implying a definite and calculable relationship."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents a clear and objective method for estimating short real interest rates, without any ambiguous or probabilistic language. The use of "could be made" might suggest some flexibility, but in this context, it seems to indicate a possibility that can be actualized through a specific approach, rather than uncertainty about the outcome.
