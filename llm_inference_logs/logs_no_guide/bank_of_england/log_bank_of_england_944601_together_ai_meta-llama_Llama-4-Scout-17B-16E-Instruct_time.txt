A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

I classified the sentence as "forward looking" because it discusses a future constraint on output growth and implies a prediction about the effectiveness of demand stimulus, which indicates a forward-looking perspective. The phrase "would be unlikely to be removed" suggests a projection into the future, which is a key characteristic of forward-looking statements.

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses a past or current situation without making a prediction or expressing a future expectation."

```

I classified the sentence as "not forward looking" because it analyzes a past situation (the effect of accumulated pension pots on spending or asset prices) without expressing a future expectation or prediction. The sentence's focus on what was "not likely to result" in a significant pick-up suggests a retrospective or current assessment rather than a forward-looking statement.
