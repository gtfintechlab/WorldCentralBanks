A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it contains phrases that suggest a degree of subjectivity and interpretation, rather than stating a clear fact. The use of "seemed" in particular implies that the speaker is making a judgment rather than stating a certainty.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses uncertainty due to the presence of phrases such as 'despite weaker data' and 'pointed to relatively stable conditions', which suggest a degree of ambiguity and unpredictability."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it contains phrases that imply a degree of doubt or ambiguity about the state of the housing market. The use of "despite" and "relatively stable" suggests that the situation is not entirely clear-cut, and the sentence is hedging its bets by acknowledging both weaker data and positive indicators.

2025-04-14 11:46:01,300 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence as certain or uncertain regarding the Bank of England's monetary policy meeting, let's analyze it:

```
{
"label": "uncertain",
"justification": "The sentence expresses uncertainty due to the use of phrases like 'was estimated to have fallen sharply' and 'a series that was often revised substantially', indicating potential for change or imprecision."
}
```

This classification is based on the language used in the sentence, which suggests that while some data is known (e.g., manufacturing output rising for the ninth consecutive month), other data is subject to estimation and potential revision (e.g., construction output), thereby introducing uncertainty.

{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific and factual outcome of a vote, with no ambiguity or uncertainty expressed."

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses expectations and predictions about future actions, rather than stating facts, indicating uncertainty."

```

This sentence is classified as "uncertain" because it reports on expectations and predictions about future investment cuts, rather than stating concrete facts. The use of phrases like "expected to cut investment" and "expecting the reductions to be 'significant'" implies a degree of uncertainty and unpredictability.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words and phrases such as 'might have been expected', 'although', and 'remained material' that indicate uncertainty and doubt."
}
```

The sentence expresses a possibility rather than a fact, and the use of hedging language like "might have been expected" and "remained material" suggests that the outcome is not certain, leading to an uncertain classification.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words and phrases that express doubt or unpredictability, such as 'expected', 'would be', and 'some companies'."
}
```

The sentence is classified as "uncertain" because it expresses a degree of doubt or unpredictability about the impact of foreign travel on domestic tourism and the number of visitors from North America. The use of words and phrases like "expected", "would be", and "some companies" suggests that the outcome is not guaranteed, contributing to the overall uncertainty of the sentence.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains phrases such as 'would depend on' and 'including negotiations', indicating uncertainty about future developments."
}
```

This sentence is classified as uncertain because it expresses a conditional or potential outcome that relies on various factors, including the outcome of negotiations, which are inherently uncertain.
2025-04-14 11:46:16,224 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains phrases such as 'not likely' and 'in many cases', which indicate a degree of uncertainty or ambiguity."
}
```

The sentence expresses a probabilistic view ("not likely") and acknowledges variability ("in many cases"), which suggests that the outcome is not guaranteed, hence the classification as "uncertain".
