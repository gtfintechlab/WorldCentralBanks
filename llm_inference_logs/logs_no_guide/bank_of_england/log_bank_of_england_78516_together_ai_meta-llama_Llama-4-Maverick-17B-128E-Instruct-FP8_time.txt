A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "the production and new orders components had both been above the neutral ‘50’ level for the first time this year."

This sentence discusses past data regarding production and new orders components in relation to a specific threshold ('50' level), indicating a historical or current state rather than making a statement about future expectations or intentions.

Given this analysis, the classification should be as follows:

{
"label": "not forward looking",
"justification": "The sentence reports on past data without indicating future expectations or policy directions."
}
2025-04-14 11:21:45,197 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and context.

The sentence is: "according to the labour force survey (lfs), there had been a sharp increase in employment of 110,000 (0.4%) in q3, following growth of 0.2% in q2."

1. **Understanding the task**: We need to determine if the sentence is "forward looking" or "not forward looking" in the context of the Bank of England's monetary policy meeting. "Forward looking" statements typically refer to future expectations, predictions, or guidance.

The sentence is: "twelve-month cpi inflation fell to 3.4% in february from 4.0% in january and december, a little below the expectation in the february monetary policy report."

1. **Understanding the task**: We need to determine if the sentence is "forward looking" or "not forward looking" in the context of the Bank of England's monetary policy meeting.

2. **Analyzing the sentence**: The sentence discusses a past event (the fall of twelve-month CPI inflation to 3.4% in February) and compares
2025-04-14 11:21:45,197 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, "that slowing had been concentrated in a few countries," we need to analyze its content and determine if it refers to future events or conditions.

The sentence is discussing a past phenomenon ("had been concentrated") related to "slowing," which implies a discussion about an economic condition or trend that was observed in the past. There is no explicit or implicit reference to future expectations, predictions, or guidance regarding the Bank of England's future monetary policy decisions.

Given this analysis, the classification should be based on whether the sentence looks forward or discusses past or current states.

Here is the output following the required structure:
