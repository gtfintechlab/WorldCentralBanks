A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

2025-04-14 11:23:10,915 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses a potential risk and its mitigating factors without indicating a clear inclination towards tightening or loosening monetary policy."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence presents a balanced view of a potential economic scenario without expressing a clear bias towards a more hawkish (tightening) or dovish (loosening) monetary policy stance.
2025-04-14 11:23:10,915 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a downward revision of economic growth prospects, suggesting a potentially accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

The sentence mentions a weaker near-term outlook and a slowdown in global demand, which suggests a cautious or dovish tone, indicating that the committee may be inclined to implement expansionary monetary policies to mitigate the negative effects of the euro-area financial crisis.
2025-04-14 11:23:10,916 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that interest rate expectations were broadly flat, indicating no expected change in the monetary policy stance, which is consistent with a neutral classification."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that "broadly flat" interest rate expectations imply that the market does not anticipate any significant changes in interest rates, which is a neutral stance. A hawkish stance would imply expectations of higher interest rates, while a dovish stance would imply expectations of lower interest rates. Since the expectations are flat, the stance is neutral.
2025-04-14 11:23:10,916 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a factual update on a monetary indicator without suggesting any change in the Bank of England's policy stance."
}
```

The sentence simply reports on the growth rate of a monetary indicator (M4) without implying any specific action or direction from the Bank of England, hence it is classified as "neutral".
2025-04-14 11:23:10,916 - together_inference - INFO - Response: {

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a neutral update on European banks' financial health without suggesting any specific policy action or inclination towards tightening or loosening monetary policy."

```

The sentence simply reports on the financial health of European banks without implying any particular direction for monetary policy, hence it's classified as "neutral".
2025-04-14 11:23:12,505 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a balanced view of inflationary pressures and economic growth, implying a neutral stance on monetary policy."
}
```

The sentence does not indicate a strong inclination towards tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) monetary policy, but rather a balanced assessment of the economic situation, which is consistent with a neutral stance.
2025-04-14 11:23:12,505 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence is merely informative about the committee being aware of economic data and does not convey a clear stance on monetary policy."

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that further demand stimulus alone may not be effective in addressing output growth constraints, implying a cautious approach to monetary policy easing."
}
```

This sentence implies that the author is highlighting limitations of demand stimulus, which is a hawkish stance, as it suggests that policymakers should be cautious about implementing expansionary monetary policies.
2025-04-14 11:23:14,255 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The decline in loan approvals for house purchase suggests a slowing economy, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "dovish" because the decline in loan approvals implies a weakening economy, which might prompt the central bank to adopt a more dovish stance, potentially leading to looser monetary policy.
2025-04-14 11:23:14,255 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence is a neutral observation about a historical relationship between the housing market and consumption growth, without expressing a clear policy bias."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply describes a past pattern without implying any specific policy action or stance, nor does it suggest a particular outlook for the economy that would lean towards hawkish or dovish.
2025-04-14 11:23:14,255 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual analysis of pay growth without indicating a clear direction for future monetary policy, suggesting a neutral stance."
}
```

The sentence appears to be providing an objective assessment of pay growth, noting its volatility and the fading impact of a tax reduction, without expressing a clear concern about inflation (which would be hawkish) or suggesting a need for policy easing (which would be dovish). Therefore, it is classified as neutral.
2025-04-14 11:23:14,255 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that the committee expects inflation to fall below the 2% target, implying a potentially accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the idea that a dovish stance is associated with a more accommodative monetary policy, which is often characterized by expectations of lower interest rates or looser policy to stimulate the economy. The sentence's implication that inflation will fall below target suggests that the committee may be willing to keep policy loose for longer, which is a dovish signal.

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests potential upward pressure on wages and inflation, implying a need for caution and possibly tighter monetary policy."

I classified the sentence as "hawkish" because it highlights upside risks to public sector pay and potential spillover effects to the private sector, which could lead to inflationary pressures. This type of language is often associated with a more cautious or "hawkish" tone, suggesting that the Bank of England might be concerned about inflation and potentially inclined to raise interest rates or tighten policy.

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that some participants expect an increase in official interest rates, indicating a tendency towards tightening monetary policy, which is a hawkish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the mention of participants expecting an increase in official interest rates, which implies a hawkish view on monetary policy. The focus on domestic demand and labour market indicators also suggests that some members are concerned about inflationary pressures, further supporting the hawkish classification.

I classified the sentence as "dovish" because it emphasizes potential risks and uncertainties, which is a typical feature of a dovish monetary policy stance. This stance tends to prioritize caution and potential easing of monetary policy to mitigate risks, rather than emphasizing inflation concerns or tightening policy, which would be more characteristic of a hawk

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence is neutral as it simply states a factual observation about the relationship between sterling movements and UK yields relative to overseas, without expressing a clear opinion or bias towards tightening or loosening monetary policy."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence appears to be a factual statement without any clear implication for monetary policy, and does not suggest a hawkish (favoring tighter policy) or dovish (favoring looser policy) stance.
2025-04-14 11:23:17,491 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that some committee members are concerned about the potential long-term effects of additional asset purchases, implying a desire to eventually withdraw stimulus and normalize policy, which is a hawkish stance."
}
```

This sentence implies that some members of the committee are thinking about the potential exit strategy from the current stimulus, which is a characteristic of a hawkish stance, as it indicates a concern about the potential risks of prolonged stimulus and a desire to maintain flexibility for future policy adjustments.
2025-04-14 11:23:17,491 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies that rising inflation expectations could lead to tighter monetary policy, which is a hawkish stance."
}
```

My reasoning is that a hawkish monetary policy stance is characterized by a focus on controlling inflation, and the sentence suggests that the Bank of England may need to take action in response to rising inflation expectations, which is consistent with a hawkish view.

  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a gradual weakening in overall pay pressures, which implies that the Bank of England may be more likely to ease monetary policy, aligning with a dovish stance."

```

This classification is based on the idea that a dovish monetary policy stance is associated with a more accommodative or expansionary policy, which is often characterized by a focus on reducing inflationary pressures or stimulating economic growth. The sentence's mention of weakening pay pressures suggests that the Bank of England may be more likely to maintain or adopt a loose monetary policy stance

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that consumer spending growth is weak, implying that the economy may need accommodative monetary policy, which is a dovish stance."
}
```

My reasoning is that the sentence highlights weakness in consumer spending growth and mentions a "squeeze on real disposable incomes", which implies that the economy is facing challenges and may require supportive monetary policy. This tone is consistent with a dovish monetary policy stance, which tends to prioritize economic growth and employment over inflation concerns.

I chose "irrelevant" because the sentence does not suggest any inclination towards tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) monetary policy, nor does it provide a neutral assessment of the current policy stance. Instead, it seems to provide a factual observation about the funding situation of certain financial vehicles.

I classified the sentence as "dovish" because it implies that the Bank of England is cautious about raising interest rates, which is a characteristic of a dovish monetary policy stance.

2025-04-14 11:45:02,316 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance of the given sentence and provide a justification, let's analyze it step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the context
The sentence discusses changes in a contract related to the Bank of England's monetary policy meeting, specifically mentioning a decline in the December 2005 contract by around 20 basis points since the committee’s previous meeting and by around 50 basis points since the May inflation report.

## 2: Identify key indicators of monetary policy stance
- A "hawkish" stance indicates a preference for tightening monetary policy to combat inflation, often signaled by increases in interest rates or a mention of potential
2025-04-14 11:45:02,316 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The decision to maintain the bank rate at 5% indicates no change in the monetary policy stance, making it neutral."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that maintaining the bank rate at its current level indicates no tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) of monetary policy, but rather a continuation of the existing stance, which is therefore considered neutral.
2025-04-14 11:45:02,316 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that the current growth is in line with projections, indicating no strong inclination towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
}
```

This sentence does not indicate a strong hawkish stance (which would suggest a need to tighten monetary policy to combat inflation) or a dovish stance (which would suggest a need to ease monetary policy to stimulate growth). Instead, it presents a balanced view that growth has remained robust and in line with previous projections, which aligns with a neutral monetary policy stance.
2025-04-14 11:45:02,316 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that there is still slack in the labour market, implying that the economy may not be at full capacity, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "dovish" because it implies that the labour market is not yet at full capacity, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance, typically associated with dovish central bankers.
2025-04-14 11:45:02,316 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a loosening of monetary policy as interest rates and the exchange rate had fallen back, suggesting a more accommodative stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that a decrease in interest rates is typically associated with a dovish monetary policy stance, as it indicates a more accommodative and expansionary policy. The fall in the exchange rate can also be seen as a sign of a dovish stance, as a lower exchange rate can make exports more competitive and boost economic growth.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a decrease in input price inflation, which could indicate a less aggressive monetary policy stance, aligning with a dovish tone."

The reasoning behind this classification is that a decrease in input price inflation (from 5.0% to 2.4%) is likely to be viewed positively by policymakers who prioritize low inflation and economic growth, as it reduces upward pressure on prices and may lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance, characteristic of a dovish view.
2025-04-14 11:45:05,875 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence regarding the monetary policy stance of the Bank of England and provide a justification, let's analyze it step by step.

## Step 1: Understand the Sentence
The sentence discusses recent economic data: manufacturing output increased for the ninth consecutive month in January, but construction output was estimated to have fallen sharply.

## 2: Identify Key Indicators
- Manufacturing output rising for the ninth consecutive month indicates a positive trend in that sector.
- Construction output falling sharply suggests a negative trend in that sector.

## 3: Relate to Monetary Policy Stance
- A "hawkish" stance implies concerns about inflation, suggesting potential

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence does not mention the Bank of England's monetary policy or provide any indication of its stance."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "irrelevant" because it discusses economic activity in Asia without referencing the Bank of England or its monetary policy, making it unrelated to the task.

{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests potential negative impacts on the economy, such as slower growth and potential falls in wage growth and employment, which aligns with a dovish stance that is concerned about economic downside risks."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "dovish" because it highlights potential risks and negative consequences for the economy, which is consistent with a dovish monetary policy stance that tends to prioritize economic growth and stability over inflation concerns.
2025-04-14 11:45:05,875 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my attempt to classify the sentence:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence is a neutral observation about the UK economy's performance and does not convey a clear stance on monetary policy."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply states a fact about the UK economy's performance without expressing a clear opinion or inclination towards tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) monetary policy.

2025-04-14 11:45:09,175 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To accurately classify the monetary policy stance and provide a justification, let's analyze the given sentence:

"seven members of the committee (the governor, mervyn king, christopher allsopp, kate barker, charles bean, marian bell and stephen nickell) voted in favour."

However, without specific details on what the members voted for (e.g., a rate hike, rate cut, or no change), it's challenging to directly infer the stance as hawkish, dovish, or neutral based solely on the information given. 

But, in the context of monetary policy meetings, if a vote is mentioned without specifying
2025-04-14 11:45:09,175 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the sentence, let's analyze its content in relation to monetary policy stances:

- **Hawkish** refers to a stance that is more inclined towards controlling inflation, often through increasing interest rates or reducing money supply, implying concerns about inflation over growth.
- **Dovish** refers to a stance that prioritizes economic growth and employment, often through lower interest rates or increasing money supply, showing more tolerance for inflation.
- **Neutral** refers to a balanced stance that is neither strongly in favor of tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) monetary policy.
- **Irrelevant** would imply the sentence does not

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that firms expect to cut investment, which implies a potential economic slowdown, indicating a dovish stance as it hints at the need for accommodative monetary policy."
}
```

My reasoning is that the sentence implies a negative economic outlook, with firms planning to cut investment, which is a dovish signal. This type of economic weakness typically leads to calls for looser monetary policy, which is a hallmark of a dovish stance.
2025-04-14 11:45:09,175 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence acknowledges a risk of persistent domestic price and wage pressures, but also suggests that a guarantee might mitigate this risk, indicating a balanced view rather than a clear hawkish or dovish stance."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence seems to be discussing the potential effects of a policy measure in a relatively balanced and objective way, without expressing a clear inclination towards tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) monetary policy. The mention of a "material" risk suggests that the speaker is aware of potential inflation

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence does not convey any information about the Bank of England's monetary policy stance."
}
```

I chose "irrelevant" because the sentence appears to be a neutral statement indicating that a UK-specific explanation was required, without expressing any views on interest rates, inflation, or other monetary policy issues that would suggest a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance.

{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual observation about the stock of broad money and its velocity without indicating a clear direction for future monetary policy, suggesting a neutral stance."

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a concern about persistent inflation, suggesting a potential for tighter monetary policy, which is a hawkish stance."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "hawkish" because it expresses concern about the persistence of elevated inflation, which is a concern typically associated with a hawkish monetary policy stance. This stance is characterized by a focus on controlling inflation, even if it means potentially slowing down the economy.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a slight increase in inflation expectations without implying any significant change in monetary policy, resulting in a neutral stance."

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply reports a factual change in inflation expectations without suggesting that the Bank of England will take any specific action or make any significant changes to its monetary policy.

I classified the sentence as "dovish" because it implies that the economy is experiencing weakness, which would likely lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance, a characteristic of dovish sentiment.
2025-04-14 11:45:21,662 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence regarding the Bank of England's monetary policy meeting, let's analyze its content:

The sentence provided is: "previous bank analysis had suggested that settlements do not necessarily lead wage drift; if anything the reverse tends to be the case."

This sentence implies that the relationship between settlements (often referring to wage or salary agreements) and wage drift (the tendency for wages to increase beyond officially agreed levels) might not be as straightforward as one might assume. It suggests that rather than settlements leading to higher wages through drift, the situation could be the opposite, or at least not directly correlated in a simple manner.

Given this context:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence reports on expectations of euro-area inflation and GDP growth without indicating any specific action or bias of the Bank of England's monetary policy."
}
```

This sentence does not convey any information about the Bank of England's monetary policy stance, as it only mentions surveys of private sector economists' expectations regarding the euro area, not the Bank of England's policy. Therefore, it is classified as "neutral".

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The mention of the MPC's asset purchase programme, which is a form of quantitative easing, suggests an accommodative monetary policy stance, characteristic of a dovish stance."
}
```

The sentence implies that the MPC (Monetary Policy Committee) is taking actions to inject liquidity into the economy through asset purchases, which is typically associated with a dovish or expansionary monetary policy stance.

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence provides factual information about export volume growth and does not convey a stance on monetary policy."
}
```

I chose "irrelevant" because the sentence simply reports a data point without expressing a view on interest rates, inflation, or other aspects of monetary policy that would suggest a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance.
2025-04-14 11:45:24,837 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that economists expect either no change or a small decrease in the repo rate, with no clear consensus on a significant change, indicating a neutral stance."
}
```

The reasoning behind this classification is that the probabilities assigned to different repo rate changes (55% for no change, 43% for a 25bps decrease, and 2% for a 50bps decrease) do not strongly lean towards a tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) of monetary policy, but rather suggest a wait-and-see
