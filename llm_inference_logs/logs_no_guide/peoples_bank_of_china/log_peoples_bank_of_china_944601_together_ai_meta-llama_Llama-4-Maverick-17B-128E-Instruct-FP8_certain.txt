A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "the pbc will also adopt a mix of policies to support coordinated regional development and guide financial institutions to step up support for msbs, sci-tech innovation, and green development."

1. The sentence uses the future tense ("will adopt"), indicating a planned action.
2. The language used is definitive regarding the actions the PBC will take.

Given these observations, the classification can be determined as follows:

```json

2025-04-15 00:39:42,434 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, we need to analyze its content and tone regarding the certainty or uncertainty it conveys about the situation discussed at the People's Bank of China's monetary policy meeting.

The sentence provided is: "however, the chinese economy still faced a complex situation, with both favorable and unfavorable factors in sight."

Let's break down the task:

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence indicates that the Chinese economy is dealing with a "complex situation" and mentions the presence of "both favorable and unfavorable factors." This kind of language suggests a lack of clear direction or outcome, pointing towards uncertainty.

2. **Justification**: The use of the word
2025-04-15 00:39:42,434 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "the rmb exchange rate has moved in both directions with stabilizing expectations and remained basically stable at a reasonable and balanced level, serving as a stabilizer for the macro economy."

This sentence reports on a past state of the RMB exchange rate and its role in the macro economy without expressing doubt or indicating future uncertainty. The language used is assertive and descriptive, indicating a factual or observed condition.

Therefore, the classification should be based on the certainty or uncertainty conveyed by the statement.

Here's the output following the required structure:

1. The sentence is stating a future action that the People's Bank of China (PBC) "will" take, indicating a plan or intention.
2. The language used is indicative of
2025-04-15 00:39:42,434 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence discusses future actions the People's Bank of China plans to take regarding monetary policy. The key phrase here is "measures would be taken," which indicates a future intention or plan rather than a definitive action that has already been taken.

Given this, the classification can be determined as follows:

```json
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence uses the phrase 'would be taken', indicating a future plan or intention rather than a definitive or current action."
}
