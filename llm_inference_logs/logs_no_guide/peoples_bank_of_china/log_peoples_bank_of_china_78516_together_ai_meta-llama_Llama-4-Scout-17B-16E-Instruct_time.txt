A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

I chose "not forward looking" because the sentence focuses on what has been done in the past (e.g., "we have scientifically managed market expectations", "made great efforts to serve the real economy") and describes the current state of monetary policy (e.g., "maintaining its continuity, stability and sustainability"), but does not provide information about future policy plans or projections.
