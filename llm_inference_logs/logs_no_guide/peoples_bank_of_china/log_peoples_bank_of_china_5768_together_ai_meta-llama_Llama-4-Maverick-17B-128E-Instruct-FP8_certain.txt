A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

2025-04-15 00:26:12,189 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "the pbc will act in accordance with the decisions and arrangements made by the cpc central committee and the state council, uphold the general principle of pursuing progress while ensuring stability, and place an utmost priority on stability."

This sentence indicates a commitment to follow previously made decisions and arrangements, suggesting a clear direction or intention.

To determine if it's certain or uncertain, let's examine the language used:

1. **"will act in accordance"** implies a future action that is determined based on prior decisions, indicating a level of certainty about the direction or intention.
2025-04-15 00:26:12,189 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "it will make good use of the support instruments providing inclusive financial support for micro and small businesses (msbs), increase central bank lending for rural development and msbs, and implement the carbon emission reduction facility (cerf) and the special central bank lending for the clean and efficient use of coals."

1. The sentence is discussing future actions that "it" (presumably the People's Bank of China, based on the context) will take regarding monetary policy and financial support.
2. The use of "will" indicates a future intention or plan
2025-04-15 00:26:12,189 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "the market-based reform of interest rates will be deepened, lending rates will be further guided downwards, and the rmb exchange rate will be kept basically stable at an adaptive and equilibrium level."

1. The sentence is making statements about future actions or states regarding monetary policy.
2. It uses future tense ("will be deepened", "will be further guided downwards", "will be kept") indicating planned or intended actions.
3. The language used is directive and indicative of future policy directions without expressing doubt or conditionality regarding these actions.

Given these observations
2025-04-15 00:26:12,189 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence discusses the People's Bank of China's (PBC) future actions based on the guidance from significant political meetings and documents, emphasizing adherence to certain principles and decisions made by higher authorities. The language used is directive and outlines specific actions and principles the PBC will follow.

Given this, the classification can be determined as follows:

```json
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence is classified as 'certain' because it uses definitive language regarding the PBC's future actions and adherence to specific guidelines and principles without indicating any ambiguity or conditional
2025-04-15 00:26:12,189 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, we need to analyze its content and tone to determine if it conveys a sense of certainty or uncertainty regarding the economic and financial performance as discussed in the context of the People's Bank of China's monetary policy meeting.

The sentence is: "the economic and financial performance has broadly remained in sound situation."

Let's break down the task:

1. **Label Assignment**: We need to decide whether the statement is "certain" or "uncertain".

2. **Justification**: We must provide a concise explanation for our choice.

The sentence is: "the domestic economy has seen stronger endogenous growth drivers but still faces instabilities and uncertainties such as the pandemic."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence acknowledges the presence of "instabilities and uncertainties" in the domestic economy, which directly implies a level of uncertainty.

2. **Justification**: The mention of "instabilities and uncertainties" indicates that the situation is not entirely clear or stable, justifying the classification as "uncertain".

Therefore, the output is:
