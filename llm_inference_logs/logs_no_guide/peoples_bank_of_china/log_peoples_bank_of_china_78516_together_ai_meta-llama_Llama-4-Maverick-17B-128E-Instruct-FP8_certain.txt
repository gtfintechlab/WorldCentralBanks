A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "the pbc carried out sound monetary policy, strengthened open market operations and employed various monetary policy instruments including raising reserve requirement ratio by 1 percentage point to keep money supply and credit grow in a steady way."

Here's the step-by-step thought process:
1. The sentence reports on actions taken by the People's Bank of China (PBC), such as carrying out sound monetary policy, strengthening open market operations, and employing various monetary policy instruments.

The sentence is: "the committee deliberated on the stance and measures of monetary policy in the next stage."

1. **Understanding the task**: We need to determine if the sentence implies a certain or uncertain outcome regarding the People's Bank of China's monetary policy.

2. **Analyzing the sentence**: The key verb here is "deliberated," which means to discuss or consider something carefully. The sentence indicates that the committee discussed the future stance and measures of monetary policy but does not state that a decision was made or what that decision was.

The sentence is: "the rmb exchange rate regime will be further improved to keep."

1. **Understanding the Sentence**: The sentence talks about a future action related to the RMB (Renminbi, China's currency) exchange rate regime. It implies that some improvement or adjustment is planned.

2. **Identifying Certainty or Uncertainty**: 
   - The phrase "will be further improved" indicates a future plan or intention.
   - The use of "will" suggests a degree of commitment or decision towards the action of improving the RMB exchange rate regime.

The sentence is: "on the other hand, due to a number of factors such as the european debt crisis, with global economic growth remaining tepid, instability and uncertainty rising, the chinese economy still faced complex domestic and external situation."

This sentence discusses the challenges faced by the Chinese economy due to various factors like the European debt crisis and rising global uncertainty. The key phrases that indicate the tone and certainty of the statement are "instability and uncertainty rising" and "complex domestic and external situation," which suggest a discussion about uncertain or unpredictable conditions.

Let's break it down:

1. **Labeling**: The sentence is stating a "should be" action, which implies a recommendation or a suggestion rather than a definitive or factual statement. However, the context is crucial; in policy discussions, "should be" can sometimes be interpreted as a directive or a clear intention.

2. **Justification

The sentence discusses the committee's call for an advanced analysis of the reasons behind the rapid increase in consumer and asset prices, indicating a specific action or requirement. However, the language used is more about a call for analysis and preparation for potential responses rather than a definitive statement or decision on monetary policy.

Given this, the sentence is more about a directive or a recommendation for further study rather than a clear, definitive action or statement. The presence of phrases like "called for" and "could be prepared" suggests a level of uncertainty or a future conditional action.

Therefore, the classification

2025-04-15 00:32:21,689 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "considering the situation, the pbc will follow the requirements of “containing the pandemic, stabilizing the economy, and maintaining sound development,” coordinated the efforts to stabilize employment and prices, place the utmost priority on stability and pursue progress while ensuring stability."

First, we observe that the sentence mentions a future action ("the PBC will follow"), indicating a plan or intention.

Next, we examine the language used. The phrase "considering the situation" suggests that the decision or plan is conditional upon the current circumstances, which might imply some level of uncertainty.
2025-04-15 00:32:21,689 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, "the chinese economy faces tougher challenges," we need to assess its certainty based on the language used.

2025-04-15 00:32:28,687 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "it will work on developing tools to support carbon emissions reduction, and improve the green finance system for the goals of achieving peak carbon emissions and carbon neutrality."

First, we observe the use of the future tense indicated by "will work," which suggests a plan or intention rather than a certainty or a fact. However, the tone is more about commitment or future action rather than expressing doubt or uncertainty.

Let's assign a label based on this analysis.

The output is:
