A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "the pbc will act in accordance with the decisions and arrangements made by the cpc central committee and the state council, uphold the general principle of pursuing progress while ensuring stability, and place an utmost priority on stability."

First, we need to understand what "forward looking" means in this context. A statement is considered "forward looking" if it contains information or guidance about future actions, plans, or expectations.

Let's break down the sentence:
1. The subject is "the PBC" (People's Bank of China), indicating the sentence is about
2025-04-15 00:27:10,511 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and context.

The sentence is: "it will make good use of the support instruments providing inclusive financial support for micro and small businesses (msbs), increase central bank lending for rural development and msbs, and implement the carbon emission reduction facility (cerf) and the special central bank lending for the clean and efficient use of coals."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence contains the phrase "it will make good use," "increase," and "implement," which are indicative of future actions or plans.

2. **Justification**: The use of future-oriented verbs like "will make
2025-04-15 00:27:10,511 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and implications.

The sentence is: "the market-based reform of interest rates will be deepened, lending rates will be further guided downwards, and the rmb exchange rate will be kept basically stable at an adaptive and equilibrium level."

This sentence implies future actions or states regarding monetary policy ("will be deepened", "will be further guided downwards", "will be kept basically stable"), indicating a direction or intention for future policy.

Therefore, the classification is as follows:

```json

2025-04-15 00:27:10,511 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and context.

The sentence discusses the People's Bank of China (PBC)'s future actions and adherence to certain guidelines and principles as emphasized at a meeting. It mentions that the PBC "will follow the guidance," "earnestly implement the guidelines," and "act in accordance with the decisions and arrangements" made by higher authorities, indicating future intentions and commitments.

Given this, the sentence is discussing future plans and policies, which aligns with the definition of being "forward looking."

Here's the classification:

The sentence is: "efforts will be made to guide financial institutions to improve their financial services to better serve the real economy."

1. **Understanding the task**: We need to determine if the sentence is "forward looking" or "not forward looking" based on its content and the context of a monetary policy meeting.

2. **Analyzing the sentence**:
   - The sentence mentions "efforts will be made," which indicates a future action or intention.
   - It talks about guiding financial institutions to improve their services, which implies a plan or objective for the future.
2025-04-15 00:27:12,323 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and structure.

The sentence discusses the People's Bank of China's (PBC) future actions and intentions regarding monetary policy and economic stability.
