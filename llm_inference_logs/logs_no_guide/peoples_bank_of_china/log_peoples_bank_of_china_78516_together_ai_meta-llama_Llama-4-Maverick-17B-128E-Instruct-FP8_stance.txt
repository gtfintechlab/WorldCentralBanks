A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

2025-04-15 00:30:32,899 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence according to the People's Bank of China's monetary policy stance, let's analyze its content and implications.

The sentence mentions "coordinated efforts... to help turn around overall economic performance, enhance the endogenous growth dynamics of the economy, improve social expectations, and defuse potential risks in a sustained way." This indicates a focus on supporting and enhancing economic performance and growth, which is typically associated with accommodative or expansionary monetary policies.

Given this context, the classification can be determined as follows:

The sentence mentions that the PBOC will "appropriately increase the quota for central bank lending" to support specific sectors like rural development, micro and small businesses, and sci-tech innovation, and make good use of the carbon emission reduction facility. This indicates an intention to ease or expand monetary support.

Given this, the classification should reflect a stance that is supportive or accommodative.

2025-04-15 00:30:32,899 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence regarding the People's Bank of China's (PBC) monetary policy stance, let's analyze its content.

The sentence states: "the pbc carried out sound monetary policy, strengthened open market operations and employed various monetary policy instruments including raising reserve requirement ratio by 1 percentage point to keep money supply and credit grow in a steady way."

1. **Understanding the key elements**:
   - The PBC carried out "sound monetary policy," which is a term often used to indicate a balanced or prudent approach to monetary policy.

2. **Analyzing the content**: The key elements here are "deliberated," "stance and measures," and "monetary policy in the next stage." The word "deliberated" implies a discussion or consideration, "stance and measures" refers to the direction and actions
2025-04-15 00:30:32,900 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence and provide a justification, let's analyze it step by step.

1. **Understanding the Sentence**: The sentence is "the rmb exchange rate regime will be further improved to keep." Although it seems incomplete due to the lack of an object for "to keep," the context suggests it's about enhancing the mechanism related to the RMB (Renminbi, China's currency) exchange rate.

2. **Analyzing the Content**: Improving the RMB exchange rate regime could be related to making the exchange rate more flexible or more stable, depending on the context. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) managing the RMB exchange rate is
