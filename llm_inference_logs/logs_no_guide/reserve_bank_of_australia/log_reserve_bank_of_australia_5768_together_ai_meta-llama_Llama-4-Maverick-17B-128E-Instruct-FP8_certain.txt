A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence states: "building approvals, particularly for houses, were bottoming out in all states except western australia, where approvals continued to trend up."

This statement reports on a specific economic indicator (building approvals) and its trend across different regions. The language used is factual and descriptive, indicating observed trends without expressing doubt or speculation about the future or the data itself.

Given the information and the tone of the sentence, we can proceed to classify it.

Here's the classification:

2025-04-15 01:00:34,962 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, we need to analyze its content and tone to determine if it reflects certainty or uncertainty regarding the Reserve Bank of Australia's monetary policy meeting.

The sentence is: "members discussed the implications of this for the australian dollar exchange rate."

Let's break it down:

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence does not assert a fact or a definitive outcome but rather indicates that a discussion took place. This suggests a level of uncertainty because it doesn't convey a clear decision or outcome.

2. **Justification**: The sentence implies an exploration or examination of potential effects rather than stating them as facts, which aligns with uncertainty.

Therefore
2025-04-15 01:00:34,962 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and implications.

The sentence is: "however, central banks had also emphasised that policy rates were unlikely to decline over coming months, in contrast to market-implied expectations."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence discusses the central banks' emphasis on the unlikelihood of policy rates declining, which indicates a level of certainty about their stance. However, it also mentions "market-implied expectations," suggesting a divergence in views between the central banks and the market. The key phrase "were unlikely to decline" suggests a degree of certainty from the central banks' perspective, but the overall context
2025-04-15 01:00:34,962 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "they noted the sharp differences in performance between sectors and regions of the economy, and the considerable structural change that was occurring, as well as the soft overall conditions in the housing sector and the likelihood of significant fiscal tightening in the next few years."

This sentence discusses observations and acknowledges a "likelihood" of future events, indicating some level of uncertainty.

Here's the classification:

```json

2025-04-15 01:00:34,962 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "against the background of rising global inflationary pressures, a few central banks, including the federal reserve, had increased their policy rates in recent months, and the degree of monetary policy accommodation was expected gradually to be reduced."

First, we observe that the sentence reports on past actions taken by central banks, which is a factual statement. However, the key part of the sentence for determining certainty is the phrase "was expected gradually to be reduced." This phrase indicates a future expectation rather than a statement of fact.

The use of "was expected" suggests that the

2025-04-15 01:00:38,707 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and context.

The sentence discusses the European Central Bank's (ECB) indication to potentially add more monetary stimulus under certain conditions. The key elements here are the ECB's statement about its preparedness to act if certain conditions are not met, specifically if the outlook for growth and inflation does not improve.

The sentence implies a conditional action that is dependent on future events or outcomes (the outlook for growth and inflation). The use of "if the outlook for growth and inflation did not improve" introduces a condition that may or may not be met, making the actual implementation of the action uncertain.
