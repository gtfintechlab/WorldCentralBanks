A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

2025-04-15 00:59:36,553 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence according to the Reserve Bank of Australia's monetary policy stance, let's analyze it step by step.

1. **Understanding the Sentence**: The sentence discusses building approvals, specifically mentioning that they were bottoming out in most states except Western Australia, where they continued to trend upwards.

2. **Relevance to Monetary Policy**: The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) uses monetary policy to influence economic activity, including construction and housing markets, by adjusting interest rates. Information about building approvals can be relevant because it indicates the state of the housing market and, by extension, the overall economy.

3. **Interpreting the Information
2025-04-15 00:59:36,553 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence and provide a justification, let's analyze it step by step.

1. **Understanding the sentence**: The sentence is "members discussed the implications of this for the australian dollar exchange rate." This indicates a discussion about the potential effects of some unspecified action or situation on the Australian dollar's exchange rate during a meeting, likely of the Reserve Bank of Australia.

2. **Analyzing the content**: The sentence does not directly indicate the stance or decision made regarding monetary policy. It merely states that there was a discussion about the implications for the Australian dollar exchange rate. The discussion itself does not lean towards tightening, easing, or
2025-04-15 00:59:36,553 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence and provide a justification, let's analyze it step by step.

1. **Understanding the sentence**: The sentence mentions that central banks, likely including the Reserve Bank of Australia, have emphasized that policy rates are unlikely to decrease in the coming months. This is contrasted with what the market expects based on implied rates from financial instruments.

2. **Identifying the monetary policy stance**: The key information here is that policy rates are "unlikely to decline." This implies that the central bank is not leaning towards easing monetary policy by cutting interest rates, which is typically done to stimulate the economy.

3. **Classifying the stance**:
2025-04-15 00:59:36,553 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence according to the Reserve Bank of Australia's monetary policy stance, let's analyze its content.

The sentence mentions "soft overall conditions in the housing sector and the likelihood of significant fiscal tightening in the next few years." This indicates concerns about economic conditions and potential future tightening, but it does not directly suggest an immediate need for monetary easing or tightening. However, the overall tone is more cautious and acknowledges challenges, which leans towards a dovish stance due to the recognition of "soft overall conditions."

Here's the classification:
