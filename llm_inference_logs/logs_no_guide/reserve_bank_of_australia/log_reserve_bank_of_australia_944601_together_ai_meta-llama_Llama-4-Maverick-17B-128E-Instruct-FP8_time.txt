A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "the aggregate return on equity had fallen over the past year, partly owing to increases in banks' capital ratios."

Let's break it down:

1. **Content Analysis**: The sentence discusses the "aggregate return on equity" having "fallen over the past year." This indicates a historical or past event. It also mentions "increases in banks' capital ratios" as a reason, which is also a past event or condition relative to the time of the statement.

2. **Forward
2025-04-15 01:11:34,426 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze it step by step.

The sentence is: "as a result, the exchange rate was offering less assistance than would normally be expected in achieving balanced growth in the economy."

1. **Understanding the sentence**: The sentence discusses the impact of the exchange rate on the economy, specifically mentioning its role in achieving balanced growth.

2. **Determining the time frame**: The verb tense used is "was offering," which indicates a past action or state. The phrase "than would normally be expected" refers to a general or typical expectation, not a future prediction.

3. **Analyzing for forward-looking content**:
2025-04-15 01:11:34,426 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze it step by step.

The sentence is: "in the united states, the yield curve was now as steep as it had been in previous decades."

1. **Understanding the sentence**: The sentence discusses the yield curve in the United States, comparing its steepness at the time of reference ("now") to its steepness in previous decades. The key elements here are "yield curve" and the comparison being made.

2. **Determining if it's forward looking**: A statement is considered "forward looking" if it contains information or statements about future events, expectations, or forecasts. The given sentence is discussing
2025-04-15 01:11:34,426 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and implications.

The sentence is: "the decline in the exchange rate seen to date would assist in achieving balanced growth in the economy, though members noted that the exchange rate remained high by historical standards."

First, we need to understand what "forward looking" means in this context. A statement is considered "forward looking" if it contains information or implications about future events, conditions, or outcomes.

Let's break down the sentence:
1. "the decline in the exchange rate seen to date" refers to a past or ongoing event.
2. "would assist in achieving balanced growth in the economy
2025-04-15 01:11:34,426 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze it step by step.

The sentence is: "members noted that the first $100 billion phase of the bond purchase program was scheduled to be completed in early April."

1. **Understanding the task**: We need to determine if the sentence is "forward looking" or "not forward looking" based on its content and context.

2. **Analyzing the sentence**: The sentence discusses a future event - the completion of the first phase of the bond purchase program in early April. The use of "was scheduled to be completed" indicates a plan or expectation for the future.

3. **Classification**:
