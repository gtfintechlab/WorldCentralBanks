A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a clear and definitive statement about the exchange rate's effect on the economy, without any ambiguity or uncertainty."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it makes a specific claim about the exchange rate's role in achieving balanced growth, using phrases like "was offering" and "would normally be expected", which imply a level of confidence and definiteness.

```

This sentence is classified as "certain" because it mentions a specific and scheduled event (the completion of the bond purchase program's first phase) with a specific timeframe (early April), which implies a level of certainty about the event's occurrence.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports specific facts and data about rental vacancy rates and market conditions in Perth, without expressing any doubt or ambiguity."

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents information as factual and specific, without using words or phrases that indicate uncertainty, such as "may", "could", "likely", or "it is expected that". The language used is descriptive and assertive, suggesting that the information is being presented as a matter of fact.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific, factual observation about past data, indicating a clear and definite occurrence."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents a factual statement about specific data (growth in prices of administered items and the cost of constructing new dwellings) that had increased in a specific quarter (June quarter), without any hedging or uncertainty.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes past trends and observations using definite language, indicating a statement of fact rather than uncertainty."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it uses phrases such as "had trended lower" and "had suggested", which indicate a description of past facts rather than uncertain or hypothetical situations.

  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a current state of global financial conditions as 'accommodative', indicating a factual statement rather than a speculative or uncertain one."
}
```

However, upon re-reading, I realize that the sentence contains some forward-looking statements ("expected to maintain") which might suggest uncertainty. Therefore, a more accurate classification would be:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains forward-looking phrases like 'expected to maintain' that introduce uncertainty about future events."

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a past condition as a fact, without expressing any doubt or uncertainty about its occurrence."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it states a historical fact about credit conditions without using language that suggests uncertainty, such as modal verbs (e.g., "may", "might") or hedging phrases (e.g., "it seems", "it is likely"). The sentence's tone is informative and descriptive, implying that the condition described is a established fact.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses uncertainty about the state of the US economy, using phrases such as 'signs that' and 'showing some improvement', which indicate a degree of ambiguity."
