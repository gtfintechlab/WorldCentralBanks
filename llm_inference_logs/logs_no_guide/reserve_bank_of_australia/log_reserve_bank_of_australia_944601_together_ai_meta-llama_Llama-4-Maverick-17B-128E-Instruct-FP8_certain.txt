A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence provided is: "the aggregate return on equity had fallen over the past year, partly owing to increases in banks' capital ratios."

Let's break down the task:

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence states a fact about the aggregate return on equity and its cause. It does not express doubt or uncertainty about the fact.

2. **Justification**: The sentence is phrased in a definitive manner, indicating a clear
2025-04-15 01:10:39,680 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "as a result, the exchange rate was offering less assistance than would normally be expected in achieving balanced growth in the economy."

This sentence implies a statement of fact regarding the role of the exchange rate in the economy relative to expectations. It does not contain hedging language or speculative elements that would suggest uncertainty about the fact being reported.

Here's the classification:

```json
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence states a fact about the exchange rate's impact without expressing doubt or uncertainty."
}
```
2025-04-15 01:10:39,680 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, we need to analyze its content and tone regarding the Reserve Bank of Australia's monetary policy meeting, even though the sentence itself doesn't directly mention it.

The sentence provided is: "in the united states, the yield curve was now as steep as it had been in previous decades."

## Step 1: Understand the sentence
The sentence discusses the yield curve in the United States, comparing its current steepness to that in previous decades. It is a statement about a historical or factual condition regarding the yield curve.

## Step 2: Analyze the context and tone
The sentence is observational, stating a fact about the
2025-04-15 01:10:39,680 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "the decline in the exchange rate seen to date would assist in achieving balanced growth in the economy, though members noted that the exchange rate remained high by historical standards."

First, we observe that the sentence contains a conditional or prospective statement ("would assist"), which indicates a degree of uncertainty about the future outcome. However, the main clause is about the expected positive effect of the decline in the exchange rate on achieving balanced growth, which is a relatively assertive statement about a future condition.

The key to the classification lies in understanding the implications of the words and phrases
2025-04-15 01:10:39,680 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and context.

The sentence is: "members noted that the first $100 billion phase of the bond purchase program was scheduled to be completed in early April."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence is stating a fact about a scheduled event related to the bond purchase program. The use of "was scheduled" indicates a planned or predetermined action rather than an uncertain or speculative one.

2. **Justification**: The sentence is classified as "certain" because it reports a factual, predetermined event or schedule without expressing doubt or uncertainty about its occurrence.

Therefore, the output is:

The sentence provided is: "the stock of non-residential building work yet to be done had fallen further in the june quarter but was still around its decade-average as a share of gdp, and approvals for new work remained low."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence reports on historical data regarding non-residential building work and approvals without expressing a clear future prediction or ambiguity that would suggest uncertainty about a future event or outcome directly related to the Reserve Bank of Australia's monetary policy decision.

The sentence is: "a risk to the inflation outlook over the medium term was the possibility that price- and wage-setting behaviour would shift, resulting in domestic inflationary pressures becoming more persistent."

1. The sentence discusses a "risk" and a "possibility," which are terms that inherently suggest uncertainty.
2. The use of "would shift" further indicates a hypothetical or potential scenario rather than a confirmed or certain outcome.

Given these observations, the sentence is discussing a potential future scenario that is not guaranteed to happen, indicating uncertainty.

Therefore, the classification is:

The sentence is: "it was also likely that having the various arms of policy all taking steps in the same direction would deliver a greater impact than the sum of the individual parts."

The key word here is "likely," which indicates a degree of probability rather than certainty.

Given this, the classification should reflect the uncertainty expressed by the word "likely."

Here's the output following the required structure:

The sentence provided is: "gdp in the euro area picked up in the final quarter of 2006, taking growth over the year to 3.3 per cent."

First, we observe that the sentence does not directly relate to the Reserve Bank of Australia's monetary policy meeting; instead, it discusses the GDP growth in the Euro area. However, the task of classifying the sentence as "certain" or "uncertain" is still applicable

The sentence is: "moreover, both central banks had maintained negative policy rates."

1. **Understanding the task**: We need to determine if the statement is certain or uncertain regarding the Reserve Bank of Australia's monetary policy meeting.

2. **Analyzing the sentence**: 
   - The sentence mentions "both central banks," which is somewhat vague but implies a specific context or previously mentioned central banks.
   - It states that these banks "had maintained negative policy rates," which is a factual statement about a past action.
   - The use of "had maintained" indicates a

The sentence implies a consideration or discussion about a potential action rather than a definitive decision or statement of fact. The use of "supported an argument" suggests that there is a debate or discussion, and "for taking more pre-emptive action" indicates a potential future action that is not confirmed.

Given this analysis, the classification should reflect the uncertainty or tentativeness of the statement regarding the action.

Here is the output following the required structure:

The sentence is: "market participants expected the next moves in policy rates in canada, new zealand and australia to be down."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence discusses expectations regarding future policy rate movements in several countries, including Australia. The key phrase here is "market participants expected," which indicates a prediction or anticipation rather than a statement of fact about a current or decided action.

2. **Justification for Label**: The use of "expected" signifies that the outcome (policy rates moving down) is anticipated but not confirmed, indicating uncertainty.
