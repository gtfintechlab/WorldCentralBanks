A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

2025-04-15 01:03:15,865 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports on past events and states facts without expressing doubt or uncertainty, indicating a certain classification."
}
```

The sentence describes a historical situation using phrases like "had continued to recover" and "supported by a substantial fiscal and monetary policy response", which suggests a level of certainty about the events being described. There are no words or phrases that indicate uncertainty, such as "may", "could", or "uncertainty".

2025-04-15 01:03:15,866 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports historical data and facts, using phrases such as 'had been' and 'had more than offset', which indicate a statement of fact rather than uncertainty."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "certain" because it describes past events and data using a factual tone, without any expressions of doubt or uncertainty.
2025-04-15 01:03:15,866 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'unlikely' and 'may', which indicate uncertainty about future market conditions."
}
```

The presence of words like "unlikely" and "may" suggests that the sentence is expressing a uncertain or probabilistic view about the market's future behavior, rather than stating a fact or certainty.

```
{

However, I can also argue that the sentence is uncertain because it uses phrases like "a little above average", which implies some degree of uncertainty. Here is an alternative classification:

```

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'could' and 'expected', which indicate uncertainty about future events."
}
```

The sentence expresses uncertainty about the future prices of iron ore, using phrases like "could remain high for some time" and "still expected to decline", which suggests that the outcome is not guaranteed, hence the classification as "uncertain".
2025-04-15 01:03:17,474 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports specific, factual information about past trends in rents and apartment valuations in Perth and Brisbane, without any expressions of doubt or uncertainty."

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific, verifiable fact about the unemployment rate and its implication, without expressing any doubt or ambiguity."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents a factual statement about the unemployment rate being steady at around 5½ per cent since mid-2017 and draws a clear conclusion about spare capacity in the labour market, without using uncertain language or hedging.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a specific, factual event that has occurred, with no ambiguous or speculative language."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "certain" because it simply states a fact about the commencement of a discussion and a review of a specific economic data release (the CPI for the June quarter), without any indication of uncertainty, speculation, or ambiguity.
2025-04-15 01:03:18,935 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports specific facts about housing price trends in different cities without expressing any doubt or ambiguity."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents information in a factual and definitive manner, without using words or phrases that indicate uncertainty, such as "may", "could", "likely", or "it is expected that". The sentence simply reports on the state of housing price growth in various cities, which suggests a certain level of confidence in the information being presented.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a possibility rather than a definitive statement, using phrases like 'market pricing had suggested' and 'unlikely', which indicate uncertainty."
}
```

The sentence is classified as "uncertain" because it uses phrases that indicate a possibility rather than a definitive statement, suggesting that the outcome is not guaranteed.
2025-04-15 01:03:18,935 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a factual comparison of market sizes and does not contain any ambiguous or speculative language."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents a factual statement about the size of the Chinese market relative to other markets in Asia and globally, without any expressions of doubt or uncertainty.
2025-04-15 01:03:18,935 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains conditional language ('unless') that indicates a future outcome is dependent on a specific condition, making the statement uncertain."
}
```

This sentence is classified as uncertain because it expresses a condition-dependent outcome, implying that the future action of the European Central Bank is not guaranteed and depends on the improvement of the inflation outlook in the euro area.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports specific data and facts about past events, with no expressions of doubt or uncertainty."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents historical data and statistics (e.g., "cumulative falls from recent peaks being back around 30 per cent", "equity prices remained 70 per cent higher than a year earlier") without any ambiguous language or hedging, indicating a factual report rather than a speculative or uncertain statement.

2025-04-15 01:03:44,316 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence as certain or uncertain and provide a justification, let's analyze it:

 Sentence: "the increase in bank bill yields since july had been about 35 basis points more than the increase attributable to the increase in the cash rate."

This sentence discusses a specific, quantifiable comparison regarding financial data.

Here is the classification:

```
{
"label": "certain",
"justification": "The sentence presents a specific, quantifiable comparison that implies a known and measurable difference, suggesting certainty."
}
```

The reasoning behind this classification is that the sentence provides a precise figure ("about 35 basis points more") and relates to historical data
