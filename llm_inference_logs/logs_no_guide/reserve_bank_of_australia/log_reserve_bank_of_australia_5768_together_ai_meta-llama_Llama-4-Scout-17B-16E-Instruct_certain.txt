A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses uncertainty due to the presence of words like 'unlikely' and 'market-implied expectations', which suggest a degree of doubt or unpredictability."
}
```

The sentence is classified as "uncertain" because it contains words and phrases that convey a sense of doubt or unpredictability, such as "unlikely" and "in contrast to market-implied expectations". This suggests that the outcome is not certain and that there are different possible interpretations or expectations.
2025-04-15 00:58:08,290 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words and phrases with uncertain or probabilistic meanings, such as 'likelihood' and 'soft overall conditions', indicating uncertainty."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it contains words and phrases that convey a sense of probability or ambiguity, rather than definitive or absolute statements. Specifically, the phrase "likelihood of significant fiscal tightening" and the description of housing sector conditions as "soft" suggest uncertainty about future events or current conditions.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words and phrases with uncertain or future-oriented meanings, such as 'expected' and 'gradually', which indicate a degree of uncertainty."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it expresses a expectation about the future ("was expected") and uses words like "gradually", which implies a degree of uncertainty or unpredictability.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes past trends and survey results, which can be verified and are stated as facts, indicating certainty."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it reports on past data and trends in a factual manner, without expressing any doubt or uncertainty. The use of phrases such as "had trended lower" and "had suggested" indicates that the information is based on past observations and surveys, which supports the classification as certain.

The sentence discusses specific events that occurred at the end of 2018, such as the increase in iron ore prices and LNG prices, without using uncertain language, hence it is classified as certain.

However, a more accurate classification would be:

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it states specific facts about market pricing and the Australian dollar's value without using uncertain language, such as "implied", "modestly", and "remained within its recent range" simply report on the state of affairs without expressing doubt.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains phrases such as 'a little stronger than had been expected' and 'around 4 per cent', which indicate some degree of uncertainty or imprecision."

```

The sentence is classified as uncertain because it contains phrases that suggest a range of possible outcomes or variations from expected values, rather than stating a definitive or precise fact.

The sentence is classified as "uncertain" because it uses phrases that convey a degree of uncertainty or tentativeness, rather than making a definitive statement.

However, upon re-reading, I realize that the sentence actually expresses a nuanced view with a focus on the expected gradual progress and the absence of a strong case for policy adjustment. The presence of "expected to be only gradual" and "not a strong case" suggests some degree of uncertainty.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a past observation about market volatility, which can be verified and is stated as a fact."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it describes a specific, observable event (increased market volatility) that has already occurred, without expressing any doubt or uncertainty about its occurrence.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a factual observation about the housing market trend, using phrases that indicate a clear and established pattern."
}
```

However, I can also argue that it is uncertain because it uses words like "gradually" and "recent months" which might indicate some level of ambiguity. 

Here is an alternative classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence uses words that imply some degree of ambiguity or vagueness about the housing market trend."
}
```

{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence uses the phrase 'suggested that' and 'had been little changed', which indicates a degree of uncertainty or ambiguity in the statement."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it expresses a suggestion rather than a definitive statement, and the phrase "little changed" implies a degree of imprecision.

  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains the phrase 'consensus view' and 'remained for', indicating a prediction or expectation rather than a confirmed fact, hence it is uncertain."

However, I can also argue that "remained for" could suggest a strong expectation. A better response might be:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific and verifiable fact about the exchange rate, indicating a certain state of affairs."
}
```

The sentence reports a specific numerical value (13 per cent) and a clear statement about the effect of the recent appreciation on the exchange rate, which suggests that the information is presented as a fact rather than an uncertain or hypothetical statement.
2025-04-15 00:58:23,274 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'expected' which indicate a degree of uncertainty or prediction rather than a statement of fact."
}
```

This sentence is classified as uncertain because it uses the word "expected", which implies a level of unpredictability and suggests that the outcome is not guaranteed.

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents specific information about the factors influencing headline inflation (higher petrol prices, newly constructed home prices, and global supply chain strains) in a factual and definitive manner, without using uncertain language such as "may", "could", or "likely".

  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'expected' and 'around', which indicate a degree of uncertainty or approximation rather than a definitive statement."

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains the phrase 'downside risks', which implies uncertainty or potential variability in consumption."

```

This sentence is classified as "uncertain" because it mentions "risks" and "downside", which are terms that imply uncertainty or potential variability, rather than a definite or certain outcome.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'generally soft' and 'solidly' that indicate a degree of vagueness and subjectivity, making the statement uncertain."

```

The sentence is classified as uncertain because it uses words and phrases that imply a range of possible values or outcomes rather than a definitive statement. Specifically, "generally soft" and "continued to grow solidly" suggest a degree of imprecision and judgment, which are hallmarks of uncertain language.

The phrase "widely expected" suggests that there is a general anticipation or prediction about the central banks' actions, but it does not guarantee that the expectation will be met, hence the classification as uncertain.
