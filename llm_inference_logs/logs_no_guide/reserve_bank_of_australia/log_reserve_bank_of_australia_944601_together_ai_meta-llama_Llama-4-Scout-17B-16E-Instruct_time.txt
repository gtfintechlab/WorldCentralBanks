A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

2025-04-15 01:09:03,288 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses a past situation and does not express a prediction or projection about future economic conditions or policy actions."
}
```

This sentence is not forward looking because it analyzes a past situation (the exchange rate's past assistance in achieving balanced growth) and does not provide any information about future expectations or projections.

```
{

```

This sentence is classified as "forward looking" because it mentions the future outcome of the exchange rate decline, specifically that it "would assist in achieving balanced growth in the economy". This indicates a projection or prediction about the future state of the economy.

```
{

I classified the sentence as "not forward looking" because it describes a past situation (off-balance sheet financing had continued to decline) and past actions (the authorities' efforts to discourage riskier forms of financing), without expressing a future expectation or prediction.

```

Although the sentence mentions "conditions were in place for a sustained expansion", which might seem forward-looking, the overall tone of the sentence is describing what had already happened, and the phrase "had continued" and "were in place" indicate a focus on past events rather than future prospects.
