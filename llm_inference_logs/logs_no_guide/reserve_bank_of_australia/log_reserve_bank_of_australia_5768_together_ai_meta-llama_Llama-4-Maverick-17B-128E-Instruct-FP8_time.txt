A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

2025-04-15 01:01:30,789 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, we need to analyze its content and determine whether it is discussing past, present, or future events or trends.

The sentence is: "building approvals, particularly for houses, were bottoming out in all states except western australia, where approvals continued to trend up."

Let's break it down:

1. The verb tense used is past ("were bottoming out", "continued to trend up"), indicating that the events or trends being discussed have already occurred or were occurring at a specific point in the past.

2. The sentence is describing a past trend or situation regarding building approvals.

Given these observations, the sentence is

The sentence is: "members discussed the implications of this for the australian dollar exchange rate."

1. **Understanding the task**: We need to determine if the sentence is "forward looking" or "not forward looking" in the context of the Reserve Bank of Australia's monetary policy meeting.

2. **Analyzing the sentence**: The sentence mentions a discussion about the implications for the Australian dollar exchange rate. The key here is understanding what "implications" suggests. Implications often refer to potential effects or consequences that may occur as a result of something else.

3. **Determining
2025-04-15 01:01:30,789 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze it step by step.

The sentence is: "however, central banks had also emphasised that policy rates were unlikely to decline over coming months, in contrast to market-implied expectations."

1. **Understanding the task**: We need to determine if the sentence is "forward looking" or "not forward looking" based on whether it discusses future events, expectations, or policies.

2. **Analyzing the sentence**: The sentence mentions "policy rates were unlikely to decline over coming months," which directly refers to expectations about future events or actions (in this case, the movement of policy rates).

3.
2025-04-15 01:01:30,789 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and context.

The sentence is: "they noted the sharp differences in performance between sectors and regions of the economy, and the considerable structural change that was occurring, as well as the soft overall conditions in the housing sector and the likelihood of significant fiscal tightening in the next few years."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence contains phrases that indicate a consideration of future events or conditions, such as "the likelihood of significant fiscal tightening in the next few years." This suggests it is looking ahead.

2. **Justification**: The presence of the phrase "in the next few years" directly indicates
2025-04-15 01:01:30,789 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and context.

The sentence is: "against the background of rising global inflationary pressures, a few central banks, including the federal reserve, had increased their policy rates in recent months, and the degree of monetary policy accommodation was expected gradually to be reduced."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence contains information about past actions ("had increased their policy rates in recent months") and an expectation about the future ("was expected gradually to be reduced"). The presence of a statement about a future expectation is crucial for determining its forward-looking nature.

2. **Justification**: The sentence is considered forward looking
