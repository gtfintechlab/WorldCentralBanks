A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "in most of the major markets, bond yields had remained close to historic lows."

1. **Understanding the sentence**: The sentence discusses the state of bond yields in major markets, noting they are near historic lows.

2. **Relating to monetary policy**: Bond yields being at historic lows can be associated with an accommodative monetary policy environment, as central banks typically lower interest rates (and thus bond yields) to stimulate the economy.

2025-04-15 01:04:37,742 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence according to the Reserve Bank of Australia's monetary policy stance, let's analyze its content.

The sentence discusses the global economy's recovery from a significant contraction, supported by substantial fiscal and monetary policy responses and the easing of virus containment measures. It does not directly indicate a change in the monetary policy stance but rather observes the global economic situation.

Given that the sentence is observational and does not directly imply a tightening, loosening, or maintaining of the current monetary policy stance, we need to assess its tone and implications. The tone is informative, highlighting a recovery supported by policy responses. There's no clear indication of future policy direction based

The sentence is: "growth in total credit in april had remained around the fastest pace of the preceding decade."

1. **Understanding the Sentence**: The sentence indicates that the growth in total credit in April was at a high level, comparable to the fastest pace seen over the last decade. This suggests a strong demand for credit, which is often associated with economic activity and potentially inflationary pressures if the economy is growing too quickly.

2025-04-15 01:04:37,742 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence according to the Reserve Bank of Australia's monetary policy stance, let's analyze it step by step.

The sentence is: "growth in incomes had been particularly strong in the june and september quarters of 2020, as fiscal transfers such as social assistance and subsidy payments had more than offset the declines in labour and financial income."

1. **Understanding the Content**: The sentence discusses the growth in incomes during specific quarters of 2020, attributing this growth to fiscal transfers like social assistance and subsidy payments. It indicates that despite declines in labor and financial income, overall income growth was strong due to government support measures.
2025-04-15 01:04:37,742 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence and provide a justification, let's analyze it step by step.

The sentence is: "it was nonetheless unlikely that the market would reach its previous levels of outstandings and may no longer provide a source of funding for some purposes."

1. **Understanding the sentence**: The sentence discusses the likelihood of the market returning to its previous levels of activity (outstandings) and its potential to serve as a funding source. It implies a negative outlook on the market's ability to fund certain activities.

2. **Relating to monetary policy stance**: 
   - A "hawkish" stance implies a focus on controlling inflation
