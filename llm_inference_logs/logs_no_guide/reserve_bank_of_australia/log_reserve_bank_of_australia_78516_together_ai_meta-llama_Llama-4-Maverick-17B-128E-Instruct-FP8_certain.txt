A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence provided is: "in most of the major markets, bond yields had remained close to historic lows."

Let's break down the task:

1. **Label Assignment**: We need to decide whether the sentence is "certain" or "uncertain".
   
2. **Justification**: Provide a one-sentence explanation for the chosen label.

2025-04-15 01:05:35,233 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "members commenced their discussion of international economic developments by noting that the global economy had continued to recover from the largest contraction in decades, supported by a substantial fiscal and monetary policy response and the easing of measures to contain the virus in some countries."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence is reporting on a discussion that took place, focusing on observed developments and their causes. It does not speculate on future outcomes or express doubt about the facts being discussed.

2. **Analysis**: The language used is factual and descriptive, indicating that the global economy "had continued to

The sentence is: "growth in total credit in april had remained around the fastest pace of the preceding decade."

1. **Understanding the task**: We need to determine if the statement is certain or uncertain and provide a justification.

2. **Analyzing the sentence**: The sentence reports on the growth in total credit in April, stating it "had remained around the fastest pace of the preceding decade." The key here is understanding the nature of the statement. It is a factual report on a past economic indicator.

3. **Determining certainty**: The sentence is phrased as a

The sentence states: "growth in incomes had been particularly strong in the june and september quarters of 2020, as fiscal transfers such as social assistance and subsidy payments had more than offset the declines in labour and financial income."

Let's break down the task as per the instructions:

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence reports on a past event or condition (growth in incomes) with a clear cause (fiscal transfers offsetting declines in other types of
2025-04-15 01:05:35,233 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "it was nonetheless unlikely that the market would reach its previous levels of outstandings and may no longer provide a source of funding for some purposes."

1. The sentence contains the word "unlikely," which indicates a level of uncertainty or doubt about a future event or condition.
2. It also includes "may no longer provide," which further suggests uncertainty about the future state of the market's ability to be a source of funding.

Given these observations, the sentence is expressing doubt or uncertainty about future outcomes.

Therefore, the classification should be:

The sentence discusses specific data regarding mortgage delinquencies in the US for the March quarter, stating that there was a rise in delinquencies for sub-prime loans to about 14 percent, while the proportion of delinquent prime loans remained low with little change.

Given that the sentence reports on observed data and states specific percentages without expressing doubt or speculation about the information, it is factual and based on available data.

Therefore, the classification should be based on whether the statement is presented as a fact or if it contains elements of doubt or speculation.

2025-04-15 01:06:00,669 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, "this seemed to be mostly due to higher commodity prices," we need to analyze its content and tone.

The sentence implies a degree of speculation or interpretation with the phrase "seemed to be," which indicates that the statement is not a definitive fact but rather an observation or inference.

Therefore, the classification should reflect the uncertainty inherent in the language used.

Here's the output following the required structure:

{
"label": "uncertain",
"justification": "The sentence is classified as uncertain because it uses the phrase 'seemed to be,' indicating an interpretation rather than a definitive statement."
