A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates that the recovery is uneven and critically dependent on policy support, suggesting a need for continued accommodative monetary policy, which is a dovish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the language used in the sentence, which emphasizes the need for policy support and notes that the recovery is uneven and dependent on such support. This tone is consistent with a dovish monetary policy stance, which prioritizes economic growth and stimulus over inflation concerns.
2025-04-15 00:41:43,869 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual update on international commodity prices without expressing a clear bias towards tightening or loosening monetary policy."
}
```

This sentence appears to be providing an objective observation about the state of international commodity prices, without expressing a clear opinion or sentiment that would suggest a hawkish (favoring tighter monetary policy) or dovish (favoring looser monetary policy) stance. Therefore, I have classified it as "neutral".
2025-04-15 00:41:43,870 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a changed economic scenario due to the Russia-Ukraine war, but does not express a clear stance on monetary policy, making it neutral."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply presents a factual description of the current economic situation without indicating a bias towards tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) monetary policy.
2025-04-15 00:41:43,870 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual assessment of private consumption and its potential vulnerability to oil price increases, without expressing a clear bias towards tightening or loosening monetary policy."
}
```

This sentence does not express a clear hawkish (concerned about inflation and potentially raising interest rates) or dovish (concerned about growth and potentially lowering interest rates) stance. Instead, it presents a neutral, observational tone, discussing the current state of private consumption and potential risks. Therefore, I classify it as "neutral".

2025-04-15 00:41:45,677 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Based on the given sentence, I would classify the monetary policy stance as follows:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions stability and sustained optimism about production and exports, indicating a balanced view without a clear inclination towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
}
```

The sentence does not indicate a clear hawkish (concerned about inflation and potentially raising interest rates) or dovish (concerned about growth and potentially lowering interest rates) stance. Instead, it suggests a neutral outlook, focusing on stability and optimism in economic indicators. Therefore, the label "neutral" is assigned.
2025-04-15 00:41:45,677 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that the economic situation is improving due to fiscal stimulus measures, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

However, I can further improve it:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The mention of fiscal stimulus measures to revive demand implies a supportive monetary policy stance, leaning towards a dovish tone."
}
```
2025-04-15 00:41:45,677 - together_inference - INFO - Response: {
"label": "irrelevant",
"justification": "The sentence provides information on rural wage growth but does not directly relate to the Reserve Bank of India's monetary policy stance."
}
2025-04-15 00:41:45,677 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses industrial production growth and does not mention the Reserve Bank of India's monetary policy stance or interest rates."
}
```

The sentence appears to be related to economic data and growth, but it does not provide any information about the monetary policy stance of the Reserve Bank of India. Therefore, it is classified as "irrelevant".
2025-04-15 00:41:45,677 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies that interest rates will rise to a neutral level, indicating a tightening of monetary policy, which is a hawkish stance."
}
```

Explanation: 
The sentence suggests that an initial rate rise is only moving rates towards a neutral level after a period of accommodative policy, implying that further rate hikes may be necessary or that the policy is moving towards a less accommodative stance, which is characteristic of a hawkish monetary policy stance.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a pragmatic approach to managing liquidity in response to external factors, without expressing a clear bias towards tightening or loosening monetary policy."

However, given the structure and instructions, I'll demonstrate how one might approach this task with a hypothetical sentence:

If we had a sentence like: "The Reserve Bank of India decided to increase interest rates to curb inflation."

Then, the output would be:

```

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence emphasizes aligning inflation to the 4 per cent target, indicating a prioritization of inflation control, which is a hawkish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the understanding that a hawkish monetary policy stance prioritizes controlling inflation, often at the cost of economic growth. The sentence's focus on achieving a specific inflation target suggests a commitment to maintaining a tight monetary policy, which is characteristic of a hawkish stance.
2025-04-15 00:41:49,160 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The mention of the cost of funds tightening implies a potential for higher interest rates, which is a hawkish stance."
}
```

This classification indicates that the sentence has a hawkish tone, suggesting that the Reserve Bank of India may be inclined to increase interest rates or tighten monetary policy to control inflation or maintain financial stability.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides information about the manufacturing sector's performance but does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy, hence it is neutral."
}
```

This sentence simply reports on the state of the manufacturing sector, specifically that it has been in an expansion zone for 8 months, without expressing a view that would influence or reflect a hawkish (concerned about inflation, potentially leading to rate hikes), dovish (concerned about growth, potentially leading to rate cuts), or directly relevant stance on monetary policy. Therefore, it is classified
2025-04-15 00:41:49,160 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The speaker votes to leave the policy rate unchanged and maintain an accommodative stance, indicating a preference for loose monetary policy."
}
```

This classification is based on the language used in the sentence, which suggests a desire to maintain an accommodative monetary policy stance, focusing on withdrawal of accommodation in the future. The tone is supportive of keeping policy rates low, which is characteristic of a dovish stance.

2025-04-15 00:41:55,643 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance of the given sentence and provide a brief justification, let's analyze it step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Sentence
The sentence discusses the acceleration of growth in non-oil, non-bullion imports as a reflection of domestic demand, including substitution effects, and expresses impatience with the sluggishness in the supply response.

## 2: Identify Key Elements
- The mention of "accelerating growth" suggests a positive economic indicator.
- The focus on "domestic demand" and "substitution effects" implies that the economy is responding to internal factors.
- The expression of "

{
  "label": "dovish",

}
```

The sentence mentions a significant slowdown in GDP growth, which implies that the economy is facing a downturn. This type of language is often used to justify a dovish monetary policy stance, which involves lowering interest rates or increasing liquidity to stimulate economic growth. 

In contrast, a hawkish stance would involve raising interest rates to control inflation, and is typically associated with strong economic growth. A neutral

{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions rising global risks, which could lead to a more cautious and potentially rate-hike-oriented stance, indicating a hawkish tone."

However, upon reevaluating, I realize that mentioning risks doesn't necessarily imply a hawkish stance. A more accurate classification would be:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence simply states facts about global risks without expressing a clear opinion or bias towards monetary policy tightening or loosening."
}
```

}
```

This classification is based on the language used in the sentence, which emphasizes prudence, flexibility, and balancing priorities, without indicating a strong inclination towards either tightening (hawkish) or easing (dovish) monetary policy. The tone suggests a pragmatic and adaptive approach, which is consistent with a neutral monetary policy stance.

The sentence mentions that inflation has been below target and that there are weak aggregate demand conditions, which are factors that would typically lead to a dovish monetary policy stance, i.e., a tendency to cut interest rates or maintain an accommodative policy to stimulate the economy. There is no mention of inflationary pressures or concerns about economic overheating that would suggest a hawkish stance. Therefore

The sentence seems to be highlighting the achievements of the Reserve Bank of India in terms of inflation control, without indicating a bias towards tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) monetary policy. Therefore, I have classified it as "neutral".
2025-04-15 00:41:58,774 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here's my attempt to classify the monetary policy stance and provide a brief justification:

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence does not contain any information related to the Reserve Bank of India's monetary policy meeting or its stance."
}
```

The sentence appears to be listing individuals and their affiliations, with no mention of monetary policy or economic indicators that could help classify the stance as hawkish, dovish, or neutral. Therefore, I have labeled it as "irrelevant".
2025-04-15 00:41:58,774 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual assessment of domestic demand conditions without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance, hence it is neutral."
}
```

This sentence does not indicate any concern about inflation (which would be hawkish) or suggest a need for easing policy (which would be dovish). Instead, it presents a positive but neutral view of the economy. Therefore, it is classified as neutral.
2025-04-15 00:41:58,774 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The majority of the voting members opted for a reduction in the policy repo rate, indicating a dovish stance to support economic growth through accommodative monetary policy."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that a majority of the members voted for a reduction in the policy repo rate, which is an expansionary monetary policy move. This indicates a dovish stance, as it prioritizes economic growth over inflation concerns.

2025-04-15 00:42:02,009 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To accurately classify the monetary policy stance and provide a justification, I would need a sentence related to the Reserve Bank of India's monetary policy meeting. However, the input provided seems incomplete or unrelated to a specific monetary policy statement from the Reserve Bank of India or any recognizable context that could be analyzed.

Given the input:

2025-04-15 00:42:07,377 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance based on the given sentence and provide a justification, let's analyze the content:

The sentence discusses various economic indicators such as the growth in the index of industrial production (IIP), order books, inventories, and capacity utilization survey (OBICUS) data. Specifically, it mentions:
- A slowdown in IIP growth to 4.5 percent.
- An increase in OBICUS from 73.8 percent in Q1 to 76.1 percent in Q2, which is higher than the long-term average of 74.9 percent.

## Analysis:
- The slowdown in IIP

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions an 'accommodative monetary policy stance' which is expected to support domestic spending, indicating a supportive and loose monetary policy, characteristic of a dovish stance."
}
```
2025-04-15 00:42:07,377 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that high real policy rates may be a factor in the slowdown of India's real GDP growth, implying a potential need for rate cuts or a more accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

This sentence implies that the current policy rates might be too high, which is a dovish signal, as it hints at the possibility of easing monetary policy to support economic growth.
2025-04-15 00:42:07,377 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The speaker suggests that monetary policy's role is diminished in addressing the economic effects of the pandemic, implying a reduced need for policy tightening."
}
```

However, upon re-reading, I think I can improve it:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The speaker implies that the economic effects of the pandemic have decreased, suggesting that a less aggressive monetary policy stance is warranted."
}
```

{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that consumer confidence in the price situation has deteriorated, implying a need for accommodative monetary policy, which is a dovish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the idea that a deterioration in consumer confidence in the price situation may lead to concerns about economic growth and inflation, which could prompt a central bank to adopt a more accommodative or dovish monetary policy stance.

2025-04-15 00:42:08,968 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance of the given sentence and provide a brief justification, let's analyze it step by step.

## Step 1: Understand the sentence
The sentence discusses the impact of countercyclical taxes on the fiscal deficit in the context of high nominal output growth. Countercyclical taxes are those that are adjusted to counteract the fluctuations in the business cycle, essentially increasing taxes during booms and decreasing them during downturns.

## 2: Analyze the components
- **Countercyclical taxes**: These are used to stabilize the economy. By increasing taxes during good economic times, the government can reduce demand and inflation
2025-04-15 00:42:08,968 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a technical explanation of the CPI diffusion index and does not convey a stance on monetary policy."
}
```

The sentence appears to be providing a technical definition of the CPI diffusion index, without expressing a view on interest rates, inflation, or economic growth, which are typical aspects of monetary policy discussions. Therefore, it is classified as "irrelevant" to the monetary policy stance.
2025-04-15 00:42:08,968 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a neutral observation about the global economic situation and its implications, without expressing a clear opinion or bias towards tightening or loosening monetary policy."
}
```

The sentence appears to be providing context and making a neutral observation about the situation in emerging markets, rather than expressing a clear hawkish (concerned about inflation and potentially raising interest rates) or dovish (concerned about economic growth and potentially lowering interest rates) stance.

2025-04-15 00:42:16,977 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance of the given sentence and provide a justification, let's analyze it step by step.

## Step 1: Understand the context of monetary policy stances
- "Hawkish" refers to a monetary policy stance that is focused on controlling inflation, often implying higher interest rates.
- "Dovish" refers to a stance that prioritizes economic growth and employment, often implying lower interest rates or an accommodative policy.
- "Neutral" suggests a balanced approach, not clearly leaning towards tightening or easing.
- "Irrelevant" would imply the sentence does not relate to monetary policy.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a projection of inflation without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance, hence it is neutral."
}
```

This sentence simply provides an inflation projection without expressing any concern or action that would typically be associated with a hawkish (concerned about inflation and potentially raising interest rates) or dovish (concerned about growth and potentially lowering interest rates) stance. Therefore, it is classified as neutral.
2025-04-15 00:42:18,551 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that the current situation favours monetary accommodation, indicating a preference for loose monetary policy, which is a dovish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the idea that "monetary accommodation" refers to a loose monetary policy, which is often associated with a dovish stance. A dovish stance typically prioritizes economic growth and employment over inflation concerns, and favours lower interest rates or other expansionary monetary policies.

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence provides information on the contribution of food to inflation but does not convey a stance on monetary policy."
}
```

The sentence is classified as "irrelevant" because it simply provides factual information about the contribution of food to inflation and does not express a view on monetary policy that would lean towards being hawkish (favoring higher interest rates to control inflation), dovish (favoring lower interest rates to stimulate growth), or neutral (indicating no change in policy).

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions expectations of monetary policy normalisation, implying a potential tightening of monetary policy, which is a hawkish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the idea that "monetary policy normalisation" typically implies a move towards less accommodative monetary policy, which is often associated with a hawkish stance. The mention of bond yields hardening also supports this interpretation, as it suggests that market participants are expecting a more restrictive monetary policy.
2025-04-15 00:42:18,551 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates concern about potential inflationary pressures, specifically food inflation, and suggests that the monetary policy should focus on these risks, implying a cautious or tightening stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence highlights the risks of inflation, particularly food inflation, and implies that the monetary policy should be set with these risks in mind, which is a characteristic of a hawkish monetary policy stance.

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence does not mention any monetary policy indicators or statements that could influence the stance of the Reserve Bank of India's monetary policy meeting."
}

The sentence appears to discuss lead indicators for specific sectors such as hotels and broadband, without referencing any monetary policy decisions, inflation, interest rates, or economic growth in a way that would suggest a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance on monetary policy. Therefore, it is classified as "irrelevant" to the monetary policy stance.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual assessment of real interest rates for firms and households without expressing a clear bias towards tightening or loosening monetary policy."
}
```

This sentence seems to be providing an objective analysis of the current monetary policy situation, highlighting the difference in real interest rates for firms versus households, without indicating a clear inclination towards a more hawkish (tightening) or dovish (loosening) stance. Therefore, I classify it as "neutral".
2025-04-15 00:42:21,739 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To accurately classify the monetary policy stance and provide a justification, I need a complete sentence related to the Reserve Bank of India's monetary policy meeting. However, the provided sentence seems incomplete:

"five members were in favour of the monetary policy decision, while dr. 26."

## Step 1: Understand the Context
The sentence discusses rising profits and profit margins, improving capacity utilization, and a lack of new capacity additions, suggesting conditions that could lead to increased pricing power for the oligopolistic core of industries.

## 2: Interpret the Economic Indicators
Rising profits, improving capacity utilization, and lack of new capacity additions typically indicate a strong demand environment. When capacity utilization improves and there's limited new capacity coming online, it can create an environment where businesses can increase prices without fearing

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The upward revision of Q2 inflation projections, despite retaining the full-year CPI inflation projection, suggests a cautious tone and potential concern about inflationary pressures."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that an upward revision of inflation projections, even if only for a specific quarter, can be seen as a sign of concern about inflationary pressures, which is a characteristic of a hawkish monetary policy stance.

## Step 1: Understand the sentence context
The sentence mentions that "a variety of high frequency indicators have declined sharply" since the last review. This indicates a negative trend in economic indicators.

## 2: Recall the definitions of monetary policy stances
- **Hawkish**: A stance that suggests a tightening of monetary policy, often due to concerns about inflation. It implies that the central bank may increase interest rates to curb inflation.
- **Dovish**: A stance that suggests an easing of monetary policy, often due to concerns

{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a weak export growth outlook, which could warrant a more accommodative monetary policy stance, indicating a dovish tone."
}
```

This classification is based on the context that a dovish stance is typically associated with a focus on economic growth and potentially easier monetary policy, which aligns with the concern about weak export growth. The sentence does not directly mention inflation or a need to tighten policy, which are more commonly associated with hawkish stances. The information provided does not directly relate to the monetary policy stance in a way

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a positive trend in inflation, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

The sentence implies that inflation is easing, which is a dovish signal, as it may lead to a more relaxed monetary policy stance. 

Let me know if you need further clarification! 

In Monetary policy, 
- A hawkish stance indicates a preference for controlling inflation, often through higher interest rates.
- A dovish stance suggests a focus on economic growth, potentially through lower interest rates or looser policy
2025-04-15 00:42:29,502 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The increase in policy repo rate by 25 basis points indicates a tightening of monetary policy, suggesting a hawkish stance to control inflation."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that a hike in interest rates is typically considered a hawkish move, as it aims to reduce borrowing and spending, and thus curb inflationary pressures.
2025-04-15 00:42:29,503 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies that the economy is experiencing a deceleration of activity, which suggests a need for accommodative monetary policy, indicating a dovish stance."
}
```

The sentence suggests that the economy is slowing down, which is a concern that typically leads to a dovish monetary policy stance, where the central bank is more likely to cut interest rates or maintain an accommodative policy to support economic growth.
