A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

However, I can also argue that it is uncertain because it expresses a subjective interpretation of the current economic situation. In that case:

```
{

The presence of the word "likely" suggests that the outcome is probable but not guaranteed, making the statement uncertain rather than certain.

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it states a specific fact about the growth in money supply being contained in June, without any ambiguity or uncertainty. The use of the word "was" also indicates a past event that has been observed, which further supports the classification as certain.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence uses the phrase 'exogenous elements' and 'impacting', which implies a degree of unpredictability and complexity."

The sentence does describe a general relationship, but the use of "exogenous elements" suggests factors outside the control of the Reserve

The sentence presents a statement that is attributed to a specific academic source (Blinder, 2000), which suggests that the statement is based on established knowledge or research, and is therefore classified as certain.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence uses the phrase 'have remained on the upside too', which implies a trend but does not provide a definitive or absolute statement, indicating some level of uncertainty."
}
```

The sentence is classified as uncertain because it describes a trend ("have remained on the upside") rather than making a definitive statement, and the use of "too" implies a continuation of a previously observed trend, which may not be guaranteed to continue.

However, upon re-reading, I realize that the sentence also implies a future action that is dependent on a condition ("to allow transitory effects to fully pass"), but the main action of voting is stated as a fact. A more nuanced view would be:

```

}

  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a conditional assessment of risk timing, implying uncertainty about future events."

The sentence "these risks are not imminent at this point" suggests that the speaker is evaluating the current situation and determining that the risks are not immediate, but this does not preclude the possibility that they could become imminent in the future. The use of "at this point" implies a temporary assessment, which introduces uncertainty about what might happen later. Therefore, I classify the sentence as "uncertain".

However, upon re-reading, I realize that the sentence actually expresses a conditional or possible action ("given the likely short-term nature..."), which might suggest uncertainty. But the main verb phrase "can look through" still implies a capability or a possibility that is certain in the context of the condition.

This sentence is classified as uncertain because it expresses a hypothetical scenario and potential consequences, rather than stating a fact or a definite outcome.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words and phrases like 'potentially undermines' and 'interregnum' that indicate doubt and ambiguity, suggesting uncertainty."
}
```

The sentence expresses a possibility rather than a definitive outcome, and the use of words like "potentially" and the uncertain tone of the phrase "in the interregnum" contribute to the overall uncertainty of the statement.
