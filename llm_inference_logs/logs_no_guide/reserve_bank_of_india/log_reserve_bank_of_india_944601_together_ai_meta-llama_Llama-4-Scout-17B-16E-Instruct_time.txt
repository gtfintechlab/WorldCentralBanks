A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses current inflation targets and forecasts, but does not express a future prediction or projection about the economy or monetary policy."
}
```

Although the sentence mentions "inflation is forecast to be", which might seem forward-looking, the overall tone is focused on clarifying the current inflation target and its implications, rather than making a prediction about future economic conditions or policy actions.
2025-04-15 00:53:44,462 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence is forward looking because it discusses how future factors will impact the outlook."
}
```

This classification is based on the presence of words like "how these factors play out" and "impinge upon the outlook", which indicate a focus on future events and their potential impact.
2025-04-15 00:53:44,462 - together_inference - INFO - Response: ```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence reports historical data and trends, without expressing expectations or projections about future events or economic indicators."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "not forward looking" because it discusses past data and trends, such as the growth in the index of industrial production, order books, inventories, and capacity utilisation survey, without mentioning any future expectations or projections.
2025-04-15 00:53:44,463 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

## Step 1: Understand the sentence
The sentence provided is "the minutes of 30." This sentence seems incomplete but appears to refer to the minutes of a meeting, possibly the Reserve Bank of India's monetary policy meeting.


## 2: Determine the nature of the sentence
Given that "the minutes of 30" likely refers to past meeting minutes (without specifying the year or full date, but implying a past event), we can infer its forward-looking nature based on its content and typical usage.


## 3: Classify the sentence
Since the sentence refers to past minutes,

2025-04-15 00:54:16,477 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses potential future effects of portfolio outflows on funding costs and the central bank's actions, indicating a forward-looking perspective."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "forward looking" because it speculates about potential future consequences of certain events (portfolio outflows) and the central bank's future actions (staying the course on inflation targeting), rather than simply reporting on past events or current conditions.

I classified the sentence as "forward looking" because it mentions future-oriented phrases and discusses potential challenges and developments that may impact the economy, indicating a focus on what is to come rather than current events.
2025-04-15 00:54:20,684 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To accurately classify the given sentence and provide a justification, let's analyze it:

Given Sentence: "as the system turned into deficit again in the fourth week of january, the 17."

However, the sentence seems incomplete as it ends abruptly with "the 17," which doesn't form a complete thought. For the purpose of this task, we'll consider it as it stands and focus on the part that is clear: "as the system turned into deficit again in the fourth week of january."

This part of the sentence discusses something that has happened in the past (in the fourth week of January). 

Therefore, the classification would be:
