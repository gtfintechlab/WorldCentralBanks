A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence states that certain members voted to increase the policy repo rate by 35 basis points. Increasing the policy repo rate is a monetary policy action that typically signifies a tightening of monetary policy, aimed at controlling inflation or managing economic growth.

Given this context, the classification can be determined as follows:

- Increasing the policy repo rate is associated with a hawkish stance, as it indicates a move to potentially curb inflation or slow down an overheating economy.
- The sentence directly mentions a decision to increase the policy repo rate, which

2025-04-15 00:54:40,840 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and implications for the monetary policy stance.

The sentence mentions that the committee expects the headline CPI inflation to move towards 5 percent by March 2017, with risks still tilted to the upside, although these risks are considered lower than in the previous assessments made in June and August. This indicates a continued concern about inflation, suggesting a cautious or tightening stance.

Given this, the classification can be determined as follows:

- The mention of "risks tilted to the upside" indicates a concern about inflation, which is typically associated with a hawkish stance.
- The fact that these risks are
2025-04-15 00:54:40,841 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, "spikes in food prices can therefore be looked through as long as they remain just that," we need to understand its implications on the monetary policy stance of the Reserve Bank of India.

The sentence implies that the RBI is willing to tolerate spikes in food prices as long as they do not escalate further, indicating a focus on the underlying inflation trend rather than transient price movements. This suggests a relatively accommodative or less restrictive stance on monetary policy, as it indicates a willingness to look beyond temporary inflationary pressures.

Given this understanding, we can classify the sentence.
