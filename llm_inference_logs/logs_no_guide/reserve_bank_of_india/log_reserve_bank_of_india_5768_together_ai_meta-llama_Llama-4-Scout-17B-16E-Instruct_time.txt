A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses past inflation trends, indicating it is not forward looking."
}
```

This sentence is not forward looking because it talks about past inflation trends ("has been unrelenting"), rather than making projections or statements about future inflation or monetary policy.
2025-04-15 00:43:22,393 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions 'considerable uncertainties surrounding global supplies', implying a focus on future events or prospects rather than current or past facts."

{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a decision made based on the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, but does not express a prediction or projection about future economic conditions or policy actions."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "not forward looking" because it primarily reports a decision made by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) based on the current situation, without expressing a forward-looking statement about future economic conditions or policy actions. The sentence does mention "evolving macroeconomic situation", but the focus is on the current assessment that led to the decision, rather than a prediction
