A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a conditional assessment of risk timing, implying uncertainty about future events."
}
```

The sentence "these risks are not imminent at this point" suggests that the speaker is evaluating the situation and providing an assessment that is contingent on current information, which may change. The use of "at this point" implies a temporary evaluation, indicating uncertainty about the future. Therefore, I classify the sentence as "uncertain".

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a mixed outlook with conditions that are improving but still dependent on various factors, indicating uncertainty."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it describes a complex situation with both positive (improving aggregate demand) and negative (large slack, output below pre-covid level, uneven recovery) factors, and the outcome is dependent on policy support, which is not guaranteed.
2025-04-15 00:42:37,597 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports factual information about the state of international commodity prices, volatility, and trends, without expressing doubt or uncertainty."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents information as facts, using phrases such as "have remained low", "has increased", and "there is hardening", which indicate a level of certainty and observation rather than speculation or doubt.
2025-04-15 00:42:37,597 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a situation that has been influenced by unpredictable events (the Russia-Ukraine war) and uses words like 'sharply', indicating a degree of unpredictability and uncertainty."
}
```
2025-04-15 00:42:37,597 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'likely' and 'may have a bearing', which indicate uncertainty about future events."
}
```

The sentence is classified as uncertain because it expresses a possibility rather than a fact, and contains words that suggest a degree of doubt or unpredictability.

}
```
2025-04-15 00:42:39,076 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'seen to be' which indicate a degree of uncertainty or subjectivity about the control of the COVID-19 pandemic."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence expresses a viewpoint or assessment ("seen to be") rather than stating a fact with absolute certainty.
2025-04-15 00:42:39,076 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific and verifiable data point (4.8 per cent) without any hedging or ambiguity, indicating a statement of fact."
}
```
2025-04-15 00:42:39,076 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a historical fact about the contraction in specific goods and its impact on IIP growth, without any ambiguity or uncertainty."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "certain" because it states a factual observation about the past, without any expressions of doubt, possibility, or future prediction. The language used is objective and descriptive, indicating a clear and established fact.
2025-04-15 00:42:39,076 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a specific economic scenario and its consequence in a factual manner, without expressing any doubt or ambiguity."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents a cause-and-effect relationship in a neutral and objective tone, without using words or phrases that indicate uncertainty, such as "may," "could," or "it is likely that." The sentence appears to describe a general economic principle or a predictable outcome, which suggests a level of certainty.

{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains conditional phrases and vague terms like 'may also emerge' and 'as the demand conditions improve', indicating uncertainty about future events."

This classification is based on the language used in the sentence, which presents a clear and specific projection of the inflation rate without any hedging or ambiguity, suggesting that the speaker is stating a fact or a considered prediction, hence "certain".

However, upon re-reading, I realize that the sentence discusses potential future risks and implications (e.g., "looming over the horizon", "implications for prices of cereals"), which might suggest some level of uncertainty.

Here is the revised classification:

```
