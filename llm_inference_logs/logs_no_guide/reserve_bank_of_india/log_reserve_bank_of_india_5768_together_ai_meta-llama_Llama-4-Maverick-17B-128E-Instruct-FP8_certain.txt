A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence given is: "on the other hand, there is considerable uncertainty about demand conditions."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence explicitly mentions "considerable uncertainty," which directly indicates a lack of certainty about demand conditions.

2. **Justification**: The presence of the word "uncertainty" in the sentence clearly indicates that the statement is uncertain.

Therefore, the output will be:
```json
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence explicitly mentions 'considerable uncertainty' about demand conditions."

2025-04-15 00:45:00,885 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, we first need to understand its context and content. The sentence is: "manufacturing, services and infrastructure firms prices to harden." This sentence appears to be related to the expectation or prediction that prices in various sectors (manufacturing, services, and infrastructure) are likely to increase or become firmer.

Let's analyze it:

1. **Understanding the task**: We need to determine if the sentence conveys a certain or uncertain statement regarding the Reserve Bank of India's monetary policy meeting.

2. **Analyzing the sentence**: The sentence implies a future expectation ("prices to harden") without explicitly stating it as a fact
2025-04-15 00:45:00,885 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze it step by step.

The sentence is: "in all the three major production sectors, yoy growth rates are the same or higher in the pe as compared to the sae for 2023-24."

First, we need to understand the abbreviations and the context. "yoy" stands for "year-over-year," "pe" likely refers to a specific period or estimate ( possibly "provisional estimate"), and "sae" could stand for "second advance estimate." The sentence is comparing growth rates across different sectors between two different estimates or periods for the year 2023-
2025-04-15 00:45:00,885 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, we need to analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "second, inflation excluding food and fuel has been unrelenting."

Let's break it down:

1. **Understanding the sentence**: The sentence discusses a specific aspect of inflation (excluding food and fuel), stating that it has been unrelenting. The term "unrelenting" implies a persistent or unchanging condition.

2. **Assessing certainty**: The key to determining the certainty of the statement lies in its wording and the context it implies. The use of "has been" indicates a factual observation over a period. The term "un
2025-04-15 00:45:00,885 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, we need to analyze its content and determine whether it expresses a certain or uncertain situation regarding the context of the Reserve Bank of India's monetary policy meeting.

The sentence is: "international crude oil prices remain volatile and elevated, with considerable uncertainties surrounding global supplies."

## Step 1: Understand the sentence
The sentence discusses the state of international crude oil prices and the situation surrounding global supplies.

## Step 2: Identify key phrases indicating certainty or uncertainty
The phrase "considerable uncertainties surrounding global supplies" directly indicates uncertainty.

## Step 3: Analyze the impact of the identified phrases on the overall meaning

The sentence implies a current assessment of risks, suggesting that they are not immediate or pressing "at this point." This kind of statement often involves a degree of judgment or evaluation about future possibilities, which can be subject to change based on new information or changing circumstances.

Given this, the classification can be determined as follows:

First, we observe that the sentence contains a mix of positive and cautious statements. It starts by stating that the outlook for aggregate demand is "progressively improving," which indicates a positive trend. However, it immediately introduces a contrasting view by mentioning that "the slack is large," indicating that there is still significant room for improvement.

The sentence states: "the international commodity prices have remained low in 2023 relative to the peaks of 2022; however, the volatility has increased for some of the agricultural commodities and there is hardening in the case of energy in the recent period."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence contains a mix of factual information and observations that imply a level of uncertainty or conditionality, particularly with phrases like "however" and the acknowledgment of changes ("volatility has increased", "hardening in the case of energy").

The sentence is: "private consumption has remained robust and is likely to be sustained even as the recent rise in oil prices may have a bearing on disposable incomes."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence contains phrases like "is likely to be sustained" and "may have a bearing," which indicate a level of uncertainty or prediction rather than a statement of fact.

2. **Justification**: The use of speculative language ("likely to be sustained" and "may have a bearing") introduces uncertainty, making the statement not entirely certain.

The sentence seems to be: "According to the assessment of [some entity, likely the Reserve Bank of India or a similar body], in Q3 [the economic outlook or a similar metric] remained stable, with sustained optimism about production and exports."
