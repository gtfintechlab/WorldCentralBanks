A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "tightening global financial conditions and recessionary fears in advanced economies are acting as drags on the domestic economy as well."

1. **Understanding the Sentence**: The sentence discusses the impact of global financial conditions and recessionary fears in advanced economies on the domestic economy.

2. **Identifying Certainty or Uncertainty**: 
   - The sentence states a fact or an observation about the current economic situation.
   - It uses phrases like "are acting as drags," which indicates a current, observed effect rather than a predicted or uncertain one.

3. **Classification
2025-04-15 00:50:15,844 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, "maintaining the growth momentum of consumption demand," we need to analyze its context and content in relation to the certainty or uncertainty it conveys regarding the Reserve Bank of India's monetary policy meeting.

Given the sentence is a fragment and lacks a direct verb or context linking it to the RBI's actions or decisions, it is challenging to directly infer its certainty. However, the phrase itself suggests an objective or a goal rather than a statement of fact or a decision. In the context of monetary policy, maintaining growth momentum is often a goal or an objective.

The sentence does not directly state a fact or a decision made by the
2025-04-15 00:50:15,844 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, we need to analyze its content and tone to determine if it expresses a certain or uncertain statement regarding the Reserve Bank of India's monetary policy meeting.

The sentence provided is: "average indian inflation is lower and trending down."

Let's analyze it:

1. **Statement Analysis**: The sentence makes a definitive statement about the trend of average Indian inflation. It uses the phrases "is lower" and "trending down," which indicate a clear direction or state.

2. **Certainty Indicators**: The language used is assertive and does not contain hedging words or phrases that typically indicate uncertainty (e.g., "may," "
2025-04-15 00:50:15,844 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze it step by step.

The sentence is: "soft global prices of metals and other industrial raw materials are likely to keep input costs low for domestic firms."

1. **Understanding the task**: We need to determine if the sentence is certain or uncertain regarding the Reserve Bank of India's monetary policy meeting.

2. **Analyzing the sentence**: The sentence discusses the potential impact of global prices on domestic firms' input costs. The key phrase here is "are likely to," which indicates a probability rather than a certainty.

3. **Classification**:
   - The presence of "are likely to" suggests that the
2025-04-15 00:50:15,844 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and implications.

The sentence is: "the outlook for growth in the current year, therefore, has both the positive features that may help maintain the momentum of 2023-24 and downside risks associated with both domestic and external factors."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence discusses the outlook for growth, mentioning both positive features and downside risks. The presence of "downside risks" and the use of "may" indicate a level of uncertainty.

2. **Justification**: The sentence is uncertain because it explicitly mentions both positive aspects and "downside risks" associated with the growth outlook

The sentence is: "hence, more forceful tightening of monetary policy in 2023 may be required if terminal rates have to be achieved."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence contains the word "may be required," which indicates a possibility rather than a certainty. This suggests that the outcome or the action is not definitive.

2. **Justification**: The use of "may be required" introduces uncertainty regarding the necessity and extent of the monetary policy tightening.

The sentence is: "although household inflation expectations are naive and much in excess of realized inflation, the direction of change is instructive."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence expresses a nuanced view regarding household inflation expectations and their relation to realized inflation. The use of "although" indicates a contrast, and the overall statement leans towards analysis rather than a definitive fact. The term "naive" adds a judgmental tone, but the key phrase "the direction of change is instructive" suggests that the focus is on the trend or change rather than a certain outcome.
2025-04-15 00:50:47,719 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and structure.

The sentence discusses the inflation rate in the context of the RBI's forecasts, making a conditional statement about excluding a specific statistical effect and then stating the range within which the inflation rate is expected to hover.

Here's the step-by-step thought process:
1. The sentence is conditional, starting with "if we exclude," which introduces a condition.
2. It discusses a hypothetical or adjusted scenario rather than a straightforward fact.
3. The main clause discusses a forecast or projection ("show the relevant inflation rate hovering around 3.9 to 4.3 per cent"), which is based

The sentence is: "accordingly, i vote to increase the policy repo rate by 50 basis points to 4.90 per cent."

1. **Understanding the sentence**: The sentence is a statement made by a member of the Reserve Bank of India's monetary policy committee (MPC) expressing their decision regarding the policy repo rate.

2. **Analyzing the language**: The language used is direct and decisive. The phrase "I vote to increase" indicates a clear decision.

The sentence is: "in this context, the revised gdp growth projection for fy 2022-23 is now at 7.0 per cent compared to 7.2 per cent in august."

1. **Understanding the task**: We need to determine if the sentence is certain or uncertain regarding the Reserve Bank of India's monetary policy meeting.

2. **Analyzing the sentence**: The sentence discusses a "revised GDP growth projection" and provides specific percentages for the current and previous projections. The language used is factual and reports a change in a projection.

The sentence implies a potential or possibility rather than a definitive statement or fact. The use of "can be" suggests that the outcome or suitability of the approach for the future is not guaranteed but is rather conditional or speculative.

Therefore, the classification should reflect the speculative nature of the statement.
