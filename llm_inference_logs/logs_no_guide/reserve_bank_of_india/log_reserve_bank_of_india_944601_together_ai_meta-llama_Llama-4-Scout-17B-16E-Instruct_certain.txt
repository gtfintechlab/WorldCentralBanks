A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a clear and definitive statement about the inflation target for the MPC, indicating a certain fact."
}
```

The sentence is classified as "certain" because it clearly states a fact about the inflation target, without expressing any doubt or uncertainty. The use of specific numbers (4%, 6%, 5%) and a direct statement about the target emphasizes the certainty of the statement.
2025-04-15 00:52:59,605 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a cautious and wait-and-watch approach, indicating uncertainty about future outcomes."
}
```

The sentence uses phrases like "on balance", "wait and watch", and "how these factors play out", which convey a sense of uncertainty and caution, rather than confidence or certainty about the future.
2025-04-15 00:52:59,605 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific action taken by named individuals, indicating a factual and certain event."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence mentions specific names of individuals and a specific action they took (voting to increase the policy repo rate by 35 basis points), which suggests a certain and factual report of an event.
2025-04-15 00:52:59,606 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports specific data and statistics, indicating a factual and objective tone, which suggests certainty."
}
```

The sentence presents concrete numbers and survey results, such as "4.5 per cent", "73.8 per cent", "76.1 per cent", and "74.9 per cent", without any ambiguous language or expressions of doubt, which supports the classification as certain.
2025-04-15 00:52:59,606 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports historical data and trends, using phrases that indicate factual information, such as 'while fuel inflation surged', 'core inflation moderated', and 'mainly due to base effects', which suggest a certain or factual tone."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents information in a factual and objective manner, without using words or phrases that indicate doubt, uncertainty, or speculation. The language used suggests that the information is based on actual data and trends, rather than predictions or opinions.

2025-04-15 00:53:19,375 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the sentence "the minutes of 30" as certain or uncertain regarding the Reserve Bank of India's monetary policy meeting, we must assess if it conveys a definitive or a speculative piece of information.

Given the sentence lacks specific details about the content or the outcome of a monetary policy meeting and seems incomplete, it leans more towards being uncertain or at least not clearly certain.

Therefore, the classification would be:

```
{
"label": "uncertain",
"justification": "The sentence is too vague and incomplete to be considered certain."
}
```
2025-04-15 00:53:19,375 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses a debate about the appropriate monetary policy response, implying that the outcome or decision is not yet clear or fixed."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it mentions a debate about the monetary policy response, which suggests that the outcome or decision is not yet certain.
2025-04-15 00:53:19,375 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a personal opinion or plea for a specific action, rather than stating a fact or predicting a certain outcome."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "uncertain" because it uses phrases like "I strongly plead" which indicate a subjective opinion or request, rather than a statement of fact or certainty. The outcome of the policy rate decision is not guaranteed, and the speaker is advocating for a specific action.
2025-04-15 00:53:19,375 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports on current trends and conditions, stating facts about the state of aggregate bank credit and financial flows without expressing doubt or ambiguity."
}
```

However, I can also make a case for "uncertain" depending on how one interprets "yet to be broad-based". But based on the information given, I think "certain" is a reasonable classification.

Alternatively, if I had to choose "uncertain", it would be:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains the phrase
2025-04-15 00:53:19,375 - together_inference - INFO - Response: {
"label": "certain",
"justification": "The sentence implies a factual observation about a past event, specifically the reversal of remissions given during the pandemic times, indicating a level of certainty."

  "justification": "The sentence contains conditional phrases and ambiguous language, indicating uncertainty about the announcement of the rate."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it contains phrases like "then the announcement of this rate should be in the favour with the rest of the mpc" and "as in the past several meetings", which suggest a degree of conditionality and ambiguity, making the statement uncertain.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific fact about consumer confidence, using phrases that indicate a clear observation about its improvement and comparison to pre-pandemic levels."
}
```

However, upon reevaluating, I think a better classification would be:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports observed data (consumer confidence improved sequentially in Q2:2021-22) and a clear comparison (remains gap down compared to normal levels pre-pandemic), indicating certainty."
}
```
