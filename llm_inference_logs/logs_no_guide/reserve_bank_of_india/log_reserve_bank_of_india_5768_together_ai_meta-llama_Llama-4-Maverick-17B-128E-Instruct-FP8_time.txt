A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence implies uncertainty about future demand conditions, which is relevant to monetary policy decisions that are inherently forward-looking as they aim to influence future economic outcomes.

Here's the classification:

2025-04-15 00:45:58,712 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, we first need to understand what "forward looking" means in the context of the Reserve Bank of India's monetary policy meeting. A statement is considered "forward looking" if it indicates or implies a future outlook, expectation, or prediction.

The given sentence is: "manufacturing, services and infrastructure firms prices to harden."

Let's analyze it:

1. **Understanding the sentence**: The sentence seems to be incomplete or improperly phrased. However, interpreting it as "expecting manufacturing, services, and infrastructure firms' prices to harden" suggests it's discussing an anticipated future change in prices.

2. **Classification

The sentence is: "in all the three major production sectors, yoy growth rates are the same or higher in the pe as compared to the sae for 2023-24."

1. **Understanding the sentence**: The sentence compares year-over-year (yoy) growth rates in three major production sectors between two periods (pe and sae) for the year 2023-24. It implies a comparison of economic data.

2. **Identifying key elements**: The key elements here are "yoy growth rates," "three major production sectors," "pe"

The sentence is: "second, inflation excluding food and fuel has been unrelenting."

1. **Understanding the sentence**: The sentence discusses the current state or recent trend of inflation, excluding food and fuel, indicating it has been persistent or unrelenting.

2. **Determining if it's forward looking**: A forward-looking statement typically refers to future expectations, predictions, or guidance. The given sentence talks about the past or current state ("has been unrelenting"), not directly about future expectations or actions.

3. **Classification**:
    - The sentence is not directly predicting or

The sentence is: "international crude oil prices remain volatile and elevated, with considerable uncertainties surrounding global supplies."

1. **Understanding the task**: We need to determine if the sentence is "forward looking" or "not forward looking" in the context of the Reserve Bank of India's monetary policy meeting.

2. **Analyzing the sentence**: The sentence discusses the current state of international crude oil prices and mentions "considerable uncertainties surrounding global supplies." The use of "remain" indicates a continuation of the current state, and "uncertainties" implies a look towards the future or
