A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The statement emphasizes the importance of achieving the 4% inflation target, indicating a focus on controlling inflation, which is a hawkish stance."
}
```

This sentence is classified as hawkish because it highlights the need to focus on the 4% inflation target, suggesting that the speaker is cautious about allowing inflation to rise, which is a characteristic of a hawkish monetary policy stance.
2025-04-15 00:52:09,199 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a cautious and wait-and-watch approach, indicating a neutral stance as it neither strongly supports a tightening nor an easing of monetary policy."

2025-04-15 00:52:09,199 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance based on the given sentence and provide a justification, let's analyze the content:

The sentence discusses various economic indicators such as the growth in the index of industrial production (IIP), order books, inventories, and capacity utilization survey (OBICUS) data. Specifically, it mentions:
- A slowdown in IIP growth to 4.5 percent.
- An increase in OBICUS from 73.8 percent in Q1 to 76.1 percent in Q2, which is higher than the long-term average of 74.9 percent.

## Analysis:
- The slowdown in IIP
2025-04-15 00:52:09,199 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual update on inflation trends without indicating a shift in the monetary policy stance, hence it is neutral."
}
```

The sentence simply reports on the inflation trends, specifically that core inflation moderated in April due to base effects, without expressing a view that would suggest a change in the monetary policy stance. This makes it a neutral statement.

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies concern about inflation, suggesting a cautious or vigilant stance, which is consistent with a hawkish monetary policy stance."
}
```

The sentence mentions "considerable uncertainty to the evolving inflation trajectory", which implies that the speaker is concerned about inflation risks. This concern is a hallmark of a hawkish monetary policy stance, which prioritizes controlling inflation over stimulating economic growth.
2025-04-15 00:52:10,936 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides specific inflation projections without indicating a change in the monetary policy stance, suggesting a neutral tone."
}
```

The sentence provides specific inflation projections, but it does not indicate a change in the monetary policy stance or express concerns about inflation that would suggest a hawkish tone, nor does it suggest a loosening of policy that would indicate a dovish tone. Therefore, I classify the sentence as neutral.
2025-04-15 00:52:10,936 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies that households are expecting higher inflation due to rising food prices, suggesting a potential concern for inflationary pressures, which is a hawkish indicator."

```

In this classification, I labeled the sentence as "hawkish" because it suggests that households are adapting to higher inflation expectations, which could lead to a more cautious or aggressive monetary policy stance to control inflation. This is a characteristic of a hawkish stance. 

However, an alternative and arguably better classification could be:

1. **Understanding the Context**: The sentence discusses factors that could influence the future trajectory of the economy, specifically mentioning lower area sown under pulses, a dip in reservoir pressures, and marginally lower growth in selling prices in Q3 compared to the previous quarter.

2. **Identifying Key Elements**:
   - **Lower area sown under pulses and dip in reservoir pressures**: These could potentially lead to supply-side constraints or inflationary pressures due to possible shortages.
   - **Marginally lower growth in selling prices in Q3**: This indicates a

  "justification": "The sentence suggests that monetary policy space is available for a relatively long period, indicating a willingness to use monetary policy to boost the economy, which is a dovish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence implies a willingness to use monetary policy to stimulate the economy, which is a characteristic of a dovish monetary policy stance. The mention of "fiscal space is more or less exhausted" also implies that the speaker is looking to monetary policy to play a more significant role, which further supports a dovish

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence does not mention the Reserve Bank of India's monetary policy meeting or any related economic indicators, making it irrelevant to the task."
}
```

The sentence provided seems to be related to global trade projections by the OECD and does not contain any information that could be used to infer the monetary policy stance of the Reserve Bank of India. Therefore, it is classified as "irrelevant".
2025-04-15 00:52:12,519 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a cautious approach, maintaining a vigil on inflation while pausing to assess the situation, indicating a neutral stance."
}
```

This sentence does not indicate a strong inclination towards tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) monetary policy, but rather a wait-and-watch approach, which is characteristic of a neutral stance.
2025-04-15 00:52:12,519 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence simply states that economic activity is evolving as projected, without indicating any inclination towards tightening or loosening monetary policy."
}
```

This sentence does not indicate any bias towards increasing (hawkish) or decreasing (dovish) interest rates, nor does it seem unrelated (irrelevant) to monetary policy. Instead, it presents a neutral, factual assessment of the current economic situation in relation to previous projections.
2025-04-15 00:52:12,519 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a concern about rising inflation and a need to address it, suggesting a tightening or cautious stance, which is characteristic of a hawkish monetary policy stance."
}

}
```

The sentence reports a decline in CPI inflation (excluding food and fuel) for the third consecutive month, which is likely to be viewed positively by the Reserve Bank of India, suggesting a dovish tone. This is because lower inflation provides room for the central bank to maintain or ease its monetary policy stance, rather than tightening it.

  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual assessment of the Indian growth without indicating any inclination towards tightening or loosening monetary policy."
}
```

The sentence simply states that the Indian growth is resilient but still below potential, without expressing any concern or urgency that would typically be associated with a hawkish (concerned about inflation, potentially leading to rate hikes) or dovish (concerned about growth, potentially leading to rate cuts) stance. Therefore, it is classified as neutral.

  "justification": "The speaker voted to hold the rate unchanged, indicating a preference for accommodative monetary policy and a tolerance for inflation, which is a dovish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the speaker voted to keep the rate unchanged, which suggests a desire to maintain an accommodative monetary policy stance and allow the economy to absorb transitory effects, rather than taking a more hawkish approach to control inflation.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence takes a holistic view of liquidity in the system, considering multiple factors, which indicates a neutral stance as it neither explicitly tightens nor loosens monetary policy."
}
```

This sentence seems to be taking a comprehensive view of the liquidity situation, considering various factors such as excess CRR and SLR holdings of banks, and the government's revenue and expenditure pattern. There is no indication of a hawkish (tightening) or dovish (loosening) stance, hence it is classified as neutral.
2025-04-15 00:52:18,952 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance based on the given sentence, let's analyze it step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the sentence
The sentence provided is: "spreads widened for 10-year g-secs, although rates fell to their lowest in many years." This sentence discusses movements in government securities (g-secs) and interest rates.

## 2: Interpret the movement of spreads and rates
- Spreads widening typically indicates increased risk or decreased demand for a particular security compared to a benchmark.
- Rates falling to their lowest in many years suggest a decrease in borrowing costs, which is usually associated with an accommod

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions considering fiscal impulse in monetary policy calculations without indicating a clear direction for interest rates or policy stance."
}
```

The sentence seems to be calling for a more comprehensive approach to monetary policy by factoring in the fiscal impulse, but it does not express a clear view on whether policy should be loosened (dovish) or tightened (hawkish), hence classified as neutral.

I classified the sentence as "dovish" because it suggests that the fall in international crude oil prices could lead to a decrease in inflationary pressures, which is a dovish signal. A dovish stance is associated with a more accommodative monetary policy, which could involve lower interest rates or other measures to stimulate economic growth.

Explanation: A hawkish monetary policy stance is characterized by a concern for inflationary pressures and a potential inclination to increase interest rates to curb inflation. In this case, the sentence highlights an increase in inflation, which suggests that the Reserve Bank of India may be concerned about inflationary pressures, leading to a hawkish classification.

- The sentence focuses on growth and consumption demand, which are typically associated with stimulating the economy.
- A "hawkish" stance is usually about controlling inflation and might involve tightening monetary policy, which doesn't align with stimulating growth.
- A "dovish" stance prioritizes economic growth and employment, often supporting easier monetary policy to boost the economy.
- A "neutral" stance suggests no change in the monetary policy, maintaining the status quo.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a specific inflation target and acknowledges upside risks, but does not indicate a significant shift in policy stance, suggesting a neutral tone."
}
```

The sentence discusses a specific inflation target and the risks associated with it, but does not contain language that would suggest a strong hawkish (e.g., emphasizing the need for tighter policy) or dovish (e.g., suggesting easier policy) stance. Therefore, I classify the monetary policy stance as neutral.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that the Reserve Bank of India is willing to look through temporary spikes in food prices, indicating a relatively accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

This sentence implies that the RBI is not overly concerned about temporary increases in food prices, which is a dovish stance. The phrase "look through" suggests that they are willing to tolerate these price increases without taking immediate action, which is consistent with a dovish or accommodative monetary policy approach.

{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses concerns about elevated inflation, upward risks, and lack of downward adjustment in household inflation expectations, indicating a cautious tone towards inflation."

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence highlights several concerns related to inflation, which is a key aspect of a hawkish monetary policy stance. The Reserve Bank of India's concerns about inflation suggest that they may be inclined to raise interest rates or maintain a tight monetary policy to control inflationary pressures, which is consistent with a hawkish stance.

I classified the sentence as "dovish" because it implies that the Reserve Bank of India is open to using monetary policy to support public investment and stimulate private investment, which is a dovish stance. The mention of "monetary-fiscal coordination" and "support a larger public investment" suggests that the RBI is willing to take a more accommodative stance to boost economic growth.

2025-04-15 00:52:29,804 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence related to the Reserve Bank of India's monetary policy meeting, let's analyze it step by step.

## Step 1: Understand the Sentence
The sentence provided is: "first, after an initial extreme reaction, cross border flows discriminate on a country basis." This sentence seems to discuss the behavior of cross-border financial flows in response to initial reactions, possibly to economic or policy changes.

## 2: Identify Key Concepts
The key concepts here are "cross-border flows" and the idea that these flows react differently ("discriminate") based on the country after an initial extreme reaction. This implies a nuanced response to economic

2025-04-15 00:52:31,368 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To accurately classify the monetary policy stance and provide a justification, I would need the actual sentence related to the Reserve Bank of India's monetary policy meeting, as the input provided ("the minutes of 30") seems incomplete or not directly related to a monetary policy stance.

However, given the structure and instructions you've provided, and assuming a hypothetical scenario where no specific sentence is available but we have to follow the format, here's a response:

```
{
"label": "irrelevant",
"justification": "The input provided does not contain sufficient information to determine the monetary policy stance."
}
```

In a real scenario, to classify the stance:

2025-04-15 00:52:31,368 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a need for a tighter monetary policy response to address rising inflation, which is a hawkish stance."
}
```

The sentence mentions a "resurgence in inflation" and a debate on the "appropriate monetary policy response", which suggests that the author is concerned about inflation and may be advocating for a more aggressive monetary policy action to control it, which is a characteristic of a hawkish stance.
2025-04-15 00:52:31,368 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a cut in the policy rate, indicating a preference for looser monetary policy, which is a dovish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the speaker is advocating for a reduction in the policy rate, which is a characteristic of a dovish monetary policy stance. A dovish stance typically favors stimulating economic growth through lower interest rates, even if it means tolerating higher inflation.
2025-04-15 00:52:31,368 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual update on the current state of aggregate bank credit and financial flows without indicating a change in the monetary policy stance."
}
```

The sentence simply presents a factual observation about the current state of bank credit and financial flows, without expressing a clear opinion or bias towards tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) monetary policy, nor does it seem unrelated to monetary policy (irrelevant). Therefore, it is classified as neutral.
2025-04-15 00:52:31,368 - together_inference - INFO - Response: {
"label": "hawkish",
"justification": "The sentence implies a tightening of monetary policy by mentioning a 'reversal of remissions' given during the pandemic, indicating a shift towards reducing liquidity and possibly increasing interest rates."

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that inflation rose back to 5.0%, which may prompt the Reserve Bank of India to consider tightening monetary policy to combat inflationary pressures."
}
```

This classification is based on the idea that a "hawkish" stance is associated with a focus on controlling inflation, and the sentence's mention of rising inflation could imply that the RBI might take a more hawkish stance to address it.
2025-04-15 00:52:34,211 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides an update on growth projection without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance, implying a neutral tone."
}
```

The sentence simply provides an update on the growth projection without suggesting any inclination towards tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) of monetary policy, hence it's classified as neutral.
2025-04-15 00:52:34,211 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a potential for stronger policy actions to combat inflation, indicating a hawkish stance focused on inflation control."
}
```

This classification is based on the mention of "stronger policy actions" to "ward-off accentuated inflationary improvement", which implies a concern for inflation and a willingness to take decisive action to mitigate it, characteristic of a hawkish monetary policy stance.
2025-04-15 00:52:34,211 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a data-dependent approach, indicating a neutral stance as it neither leans towards tightening nor easing monetary policy."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence does not indicate a clear direction for future monetary policy actions, instead suggesting that the course of action will depend on the development of growth and inflation scenarios. This kind of language is typically associated with a neutral monetary policy stance.
2025-04-15 00:52:34,211 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual update on international commodity prices without expressing a clear bias towards tightening or loosening monetary policy."
}
```

This sentence appears to be providing an objective observation about the state of international commodity prices, without expressing a clear opinion or sentiment that would suggest a hawkish (inflation-fighting) or dovish (growth-supporting) stance. Therefore, I have classified it as "neutral".

2025-04-15 00:52:46,985 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance of the given sentence and provide a brief justification, let's analyze the content:

The sentence provided is: "this, in turn, may act in narrower with falling external demand acting to dampen price pressures that have turned elevated from the supply-side."

## Step 1: Understand the Terminology
- **Hawkish**: Indicates a stance that is more concerned with inflation and might lean towards increasing interest rates to control it.
- **Dovish**: Suggests a stance that prioritizes economic growth and might lean towards lowering interest rates to stimulate the economy.
- **Neutral**: Implies a balanced view,

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that easing international crude prices will alleviate pressure on headline inflation, implying a potential for monetary policy relaxation, which is a dovish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the implication that the easing of international crude prices and its pass-through to domestic prices will have a positive effect on inflation, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy, characteristic of a dovish stance.
2025-04-15 00:52:46,985 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual assessment of economic growth without expressing a clear bias towards tightening or loosening monetary policy."
}
```

The sentence simply presents data on economic growth without any emotive language or clear indication of a policy direction, hence it is classified as "neutral".
2025-04-15 00:52:46,985 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a positive outlook on inflation, indicating a potentially accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

The sentence implies that the inflation outlook is benign, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy, hence the "dovish" label.
2025-04-15 00:52:46,985 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that the rate announcement should be in line with the rest of the MPC, indicating a neutral stance with no clear indication of a hawkish or dovish bias."
}
```

The sentence appears to be discussing the process of decision-making within the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) and does not contain language that would suggest a strong inclination towards tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) monetary policy. The emphasis on consistency with the rest of the MPC suggests a neutral or balanced approach. Therefore, I classify the stance

2025-04-15 00:52:49,855 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance based on the given sentence and provide a justification, let's analyze the sentence: "much of this weakness seems to have continued into moved into expansion zone in march after three months of contraction."

The sentence implies that after a period of economic contraction, there was a move into an expansion zone, which suggests a positive outlook on the economy's current state and potentially a less stringent monetary policy stance.

Given this context:

- A "hawkish" stance refers to a preference for raising interest rates to control inflation, which doesn't seem directly supported by the sentence's focus on economic expansion.
- A "dovish" stance

{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a concern for inflation and a need for the central bank to maintain a tough stance on inflation targeting, indicating a hawkish tone."
}
```

The sentence suggests that the central bank should prioritize credible inflation targeting to mitigate potential negative effects on funding costs, which is a hawkish stance that prioritizes controlling inflation over other economic concerns.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence acknowledges potential price adjustments due to pandemic-induced supply-side changes, but does not indicate a clear bias towards tightening or loosening monetary policy."
}
```

The sentence seems to be discussing a possible outcome of improving demand conditions and does not express a clear hawkish (concerned about inflation and potentially raising interest rates) or dovish (concerned about growth and potentially lowering interest rates) stance. Therefore, I classified it as "neutral".
2025-04-15 00:52:54,594 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a concern for inflation, suggesting that the Reserve Bank of India may prioritize inflation-fighting over growth, which is a hawkish stance."
}
```

In this classification, I labeled the sentence as "hawkish" because it highlights the fight against inflation, which is a primary concern of a hawkish monetary policy stance. The mention of complications due to the global outlook does not diminish the focus on inflation, which is a key aspect of hawkishness.
2025-04-15 00:52:54,594 - together_inference - INFO - Response: {
"label": "dovish",
"justification": "The sentence implies a relatively mild inflation rate, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
2025-04-15 00:52:54,594 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence highlights external uncertainties and challenges, suggesting a cautious tone that is typically associated with a dovish monetary policy stance."
}
```

The sentence mentions "external environment is turning more uncertain and challenging" and lists several risks, which implies that the Reserve Bank of India might be inclined to maintain or adopt a accommodative monetary policy stance, which is characteristic of a dovish stance.
2025-04-15 00:52:54,594 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To accurately classify the monetary policy stance and provide a justification, let's analyze the given sentence: "as the system turned into deficit again in the fourth week of january, the 17."

Given the incomplete and unclear nature of the sentence regarding standard monetary policy discussions, it seems challenging to directly infer a stance towards tightening (hawkish), easing (dovish), or maintaining (neutral) monetary policy. The mention of a system turning into deficit and a number ("17") without context (e.g., relating to interest rates, money supply, etc.) makes it difficult to ascertain a clear monetary policy stance.
