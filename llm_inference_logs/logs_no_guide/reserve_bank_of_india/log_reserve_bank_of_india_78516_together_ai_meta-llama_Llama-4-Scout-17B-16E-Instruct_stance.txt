A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence highlights external factors dragging on the domestic economy, suggesting a concern for economic growth and potentially leading to a more accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "dovish" because it emphasizes the negative impact of global financial conditions on the domestic economy, which is a concern typically associated with a dovish monetary policy stance that prioritizes economic growth and may lead to looser monetary policy.
2025-04-15 00:46:55,968 - together_inference - INFO - Response: ```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a focus on supporting economic growth through consumption demand, which is a dovish stance as it prioritizes growth over inflation concerns."

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The statement that average Indian inflation is lower and trending down suggests a comfortable inflation environment, which is a dovish stance as it may lead to a more accommodative monetary policy."
}
```

This classification is based on the understanding that:

- A hawkish stance is associated with concerns about inflation and a potential need to tighten monetary policy to control it.
- A dovish stance is associated with a focus on economic growth and low inflation, suggesting a more accommodative monetary policy.
- A neutral stance indicates no clear inclination towards tightening or
2025-04-15 00:46:55,968 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that low input costs could lead to lower inflation, which is a dovish signal as it may prompt the RBI to maintain or ease monetary policy."
}
```

This classification is based on the idea that a dovish monetary policy stance is associated with a focus on economic growth and low inflation, which is consistent with the sentence's implication that low input costs could keep inflation in check.
2025-04-15 00:46:55,968 - together_inference - INFO - Response: {

This sentence does not express a clear hawkish (concerned about inflation and potentially raising interest rates) or dovish (concerned about growth and potentially lowering interest rates) stance. Instead, it provides a factual observation about global conditions and their impact on prices, which is a neutral statement. Therefore, I classify it as "neutral".

## Step 1: Understand the Sentence
The sentence provided is: "on the other hand, it is most likely to be more than off-set by the implementation of gst in its present form." This sentence seems to discuss the potential impact of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) implementation on the economy, possibly in the context of inflation or economic growth, which are relevant to monetary policy decisions.

2025-04-15 00:47:05,465 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that inflationary pressures from vegetable prices are likely to remain soft, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence provides a positive outlook on inflation, indicating that a major source of inflation volatility is under control. A dovish stance is characterized by a focus on economic growth and low inflation, which aligns with the tone of the sentence.
2025-04-15 00:47:05,465 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual update on economic activity in emerging market economies and does not convey a clear direction for monetary policy, hence it is neutral."
}
```

This sentence simply reports on the state of economic activity in emerging market economies without expressing a view that would lead to a tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) of monetary policy. Therefore, it is classified as neutral.

The sentence mentions a specific inflation target (5% by March 2017) and notes that risks are tilted to the upside, but it does not contain language that would suggest a hawkish (e.g., emphasizing the need for tighter policy) or dovish (e.g., suggesting easier policy) stance.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a benign near-term inflation outlook, implying a less aggressive monetary policy stance, which is characteristic of a dovish tone."
}
```

This classification is based on the understanding that:

* Hawkish: implies a concern about inflation and a potential need for tighter monetary policy.
* Dovish: implies a concern about growth and a potential need for looser monetary policy.
* Neutral: implies no clear bias towards tightening or loosening monetary policy.
* Irrelevant: implies the sentence does not provide any information about the monetary policy

The sentence mentions "monetary policy normalisation", which typically implies a shift towards a less accommodative policy stance, often associated with a hawkish tone. This suggests that the market expects the Reserve Bank of India to potentially raise interest rates or reduce liquidity, leading to higher bond yields. 

However, note that the sentence does not directly relate to the Reserve

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides factual information about credit growth and does not convey a clear direction for future monetary policy, hence it is neutral."

{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that inflation expectations have declined or remained stable, which could indicate a more accommodative monetary policy stance, aligning with a dovish tone."
}
```

The reasoning behind this classification is that the sentence implies a positive outlook on inflation, which could lead to a more dovish monetary policy stance, as it suggests that the Reserve Bank of India might be more likely to keep interest rates low or even consider easing policy to support economic growth.
2025-04-15 00:47:14,470 - together_inference - INFO - Response: {

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence highlights weakening industrial growth and sluggish core industries, suggesting a need for accommodative monetary policy, which is a dovish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence presents a negative view of the current economic situation, which is likely to lead to a dovish monetary policy stance, where the central bank is more likely to cut interest rates or maintain an accommodative policy to stimulate growth.
2025-04-15 00:47:14,470 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a concern about rising inflation, which is a hawkish stance, as it suggests that the Reserve Bank of India may need to take action to control inflation."
}
```

In this case, I classified the sentence as "hawkish" because it highlights a potential upside risk to inflation, which is a concern that is typically associated with a hawkish monetary policy stance.

I classified the sentence as "neutral" because it presents a general theoretical perspective on the importance of credibility in monetary policy, without indicating a specific direction for policy or expressing a strong view on inflation that would suggest a hawkish or dovish stance.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The speaker voted to hold the rate unchanged, indicating a preference for accommodative monetary policy and a tolerance for inflation, which is a dovish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the speaker voted to keep the rate unchanged, which suggests a desire to maintain an accommodative monetary policy stance and allow the economy to absorb transitory effects, rather than taking a more hawkish approach to control inflation.
2025-04-15 00:47:17,618 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses concern about inflation expectations becoming entrenched if inflation remains elevated, indicating a cautious tone towards inflation, which is characteristic of a hawkish stance."
}
```

This sentence suggests that the MPC is vigilant about inflation risks, which is a key aspect of a hawkish monetary policy stance. The mention of the risk of inflation expectations becoming entrenched implies that the MPC may consider tightening policy to mitigate this risk, further supporting the hawkish classification.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The statement mentions the continuation of the accommodative monetary policy stance, indicating a supportive and loose monetary policy, which is characteristic of a dovish stance."

This classification is based on the understanding that:

* Dovish: supportive and loose monetary policy, focused on economic growth and employment.
* Hawkish: tight monetary policy, focused on controlling inflation.
* Neutral: neither expansionary nor contractionary monetary policy.
* Irrelevant: the sentence does not relate to monetary policy.

{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that monetary policy has more space to affect demand, implying a willingness to use expansionary monetary policy, which is a dovish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the idea that a dovish monetary policy stance is characterized by a willingness to use expansionary monetary policy to stimulate economic growth, which is indicated by the sentence's mention of monetary policy having more space to affect demand.
2025-04-15 00:47:17,618 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a decline in inflation, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance, indicating a dovish tone."
}
```

The sentence mentions a moderation in headline inflation, which is a key factor in the Reserve Bank of India's monetary policy decisions. The decline in inflation from 4.6% to 3.4% over a few months could be seen as a sign of easing inflationary pressures, which might lead the central bank to consider a more dovish stance, potentially cutting interest rates to support economic growth

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that the Reserve Bank of India will not react to temporary inflation shocks, indicating a neutral stance towards monetary policy."
}
```

The sentence implies that the RBI is willing to "look through" temporary shocks to inflation, which suggests a neutral or non-reactive stance, rather than trying to aggressively tighten (hawkish) or loosen (dovish) policy. This justifies the classification as "neutral".

In this classification:

- "dovish" implies a more accommodative monetary policy stance, which is likely when inflation is not widespread.
- The sentence does not directly mention the Reserve Bank of India's monetary policy or a broad inflationary trend, but it hints at a contained inflation scenario, which could support a dovish stance.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The statement advocates for maintaining an accommodative stance to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, indicating a preference for loose monetary policy."
}
```

This classification is based on the language used in the sentence, which emphasizes the need to "mitigate the impact of covid-19 on the economy" and maintain an "accommodative" stance, suggesting a dovish tone.
2025-04-15 00:47:41,954 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence focuses on the Reserve Bank of India's past success in keeping inflation within the tolerance band, without expressing a clear direction for future policy actions."
}
```

The sentence does not indicate a hawkish (tightening) or dovish (loosening) stance, but rather highlights the central bank's past achievements, suggesting a neutral tone.

The sentence provided does not contain information that would suggest a hawkish (favoring higher interest rates) or dovish (favoring lower interest rates) stance. Instead, it presents a factual assessment of the situation, which aligns more with a neutral monetary policy stance.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that the economy is expected to improve, which could lead to a loosening of monetary policy, indicating a dovish stance."
}
```

The sentence implies that the economy is recovering, and a further pick-up is expected, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy, characteristic of a dovish stance. 

However, given that capacity utilisation is not directly a monetary policy tool or a direct indicator of inflation, and given that it does not explicitly mention inflation or growth targets, one could argue it is more neutral
2025-04-15 00:47:41,955 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests reconsidering a neutral policy stance in favour of an accommodative stance, indicating a preference for a more relaxed monetary policy, which is characteristic of a dovish stance."
}
```

In this case, I chose "dovish" because the sentence advocates for an accommodative stance, which is associated with a dovish monetary policy approach. This approach typically prioritizes economic growth and employment over inflation concerns, and involves measures such as lowering interest rates to stimulate the economy.

The sentence simply reports on the positive trend in the manufacturing sector without expressing a view that would influence or reflect a hawkish (concerned about inflation, potentially leading to rate hikes), dovish (concerned about growth, potentially leading to rate cuts), or directly suggestive of a change in monetary policy. Therefore, it is classified as neutral.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides an objective analysis of the fiscal stimulus and its potential impact on public and private investment, without expressing a clear opinion or bias towards tightening or loosening monetary policy."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply presents an assessment of the situation without indicating a need for a change in the monetary policy stance, nor does it suggest that the policy should be kept unchanged. The tone is informative and analytical, rather than advocating for a specific policy action.

{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that vegetable prices are subject to seasonality and can be addressed through monetary policy actions, but does not indicate a bias towards tightening or loosening policy, hence a neutral stance."
}
```

The sentence seems to be discussing the impact of vegetable prices on monetary policy, and how they can be addressed through policy actions. The tone is informative and analytical, without expressing a clear bias towards a more hawkish (tightening) or dovish (loosening) stance. Therefore, I classify it as neutral.
