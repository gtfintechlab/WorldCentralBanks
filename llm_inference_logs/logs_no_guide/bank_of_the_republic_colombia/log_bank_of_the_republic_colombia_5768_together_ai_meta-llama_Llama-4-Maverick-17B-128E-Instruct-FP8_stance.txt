A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

1. **Understanding the Sentence**: The sentence mentions an "upside adjustment" driven by "enduring global inflation pressures" that results in tightening "financing conditions for the Colombian economy."

2. **Identifying Key Elements**:
   - "Upside adjustment" typically implies an increase or a more pessimistic outlook, often related to inflation or economic growth.
   - "Enduring global inflation pressures" suggests that inflation is a concern and is expected to continue being so.
   - "Tightens financing

The sentence mentions that "the annual variation in eating was down again, although slightly, reaching 4.9% within the non-food CPI, the regulated sub-basket posted an annual variation of 1.9% (88 bp less than in November)". This information indicates a decrease in inflation rates, both in the eating category within non-food CPI and in the regulated sub-basket. A decrease in inflation can be associated with a dovish stance if it suggests that inflation is under control or moving towards the
2025-04-14 10:10:58,884 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence according to the Bank of the Republic (Colombia)'s monetary policy stance, let's analyze the information provided.

The sentence mentions that the majority of co-directors voted in favor of increasing the benchmark interest rate by 25 bp. Increasing the benchmark interest rate is typically associated with a tightening monetary policy, which is aimed at controlling inflation or managing economic growth. This action is characteristic of a hawkish stance, as it indicates a focus on potentially curbing inflation or slowing down an overheating economy by making borrowing more expensive.

Therefore, the classification should reflect this tightening or hawkish orientation.

Here's the output following the
2025-04-14 10:10:58,884 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence according to the Bank of the Republic (Colombia)'s monetary policy stance, let's analyze the information provided.

The sentence mentions a meeting where "the situation with respect to inflation and economic growth was discussed, as were their prospects for the future, and decisions on monetary policy were reached." It does not, however, provide any details about the direction of the decisions made regarding monetary policy.

Given that there's no specific information about whether the monetary policy was tightened, eased, or remained unchanged, we must rely on the tone and content of the sentence.

2025-04-14 10:10:58,884 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence according to the Bank of the Republic (Colombia)'s monetary policy stance, we need to analyze its content and implications for monetary policy.

The sentence is: "for 2011, macroeconomic conditions continue to support an important economic growth."

1. **Label Assignment**: The statement implies a positive outlook on economic growth. A positive economic growth outlook can be associated with a hawkish stance if it suggests that the economy is growing strongly enough to potentially lead to inflationary pressures, thus necessitating tighter monetary policy. However, it doesn't directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance or explicitly mention inflation or interest rates.

2. **Relating to monetary policy**: In the context of a central bank's monetary policy meeting, a deterioration in the international situation could imply potential negative impacts on the domestic economy, such as increased inflation due to supply chain disruptions, decreased exports, or capital outflows.

2025-04-14 10:11:13,257 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence according to the Bank of the Republic (Colombia)'s monetary policy stance, we need to understand the implications of the statement "international prices for food, raw materials, and oil continue to decline" on monetary policy decisions.

Declining international prices for essential commodities like food, raw materials, and oil generally suggest a reduction in inflationary pressures. Lower commodity prices can lead to lower production costs and consumer prices, potentially easing inflation. In the context of monetary policy, easing inflationary pressures can provide room for more accommodative monetary policies, as the central bank might not need to raise interest rates to combat inflation.

Given this
