A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses the future impact of an adjustment on financing conditions for the Colombian economy, indicating a forward-looking statement."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "forward looking" because it implies a future effect of the upside adjustment on the Colombian economy's financing conditions, rather than simply describing a current or past situation.
2025-04-14 10:10:17,501 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses past data and variations, without referencing future projections or expectations."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "not forward looking" because it only reports on past data (annual variation in eating, non-food CPI, and regulated sub-basket) without mentioning any future projections, expectations, or plans related to the Bank of the Republic's monetary policy.
2025-04-14 10:10:17,501 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence reports on a past decision made by the board, specifically the voting outcome on increasing the benchmark interest rate."
}
```

I chose "not forward looking" because the sentence describes a past event (the voting outcome) rather than expressing a future intention or prediction about the monetary policy stance.
2025-04-14 10:10:17,501 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions discussing prospects for the future, indicating a focus on future events or expectations."
}
```

This classification is based on the phrase "their prospects for the future", which implies a forward-looking perspective, as it involves discussing expectations or predictions about future events, specifically regarding inflation and economic growth.
2025-04-14 10:10:17,501 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",

This sentence is not forward looking because it only provides past inflation data for specific years (2009, 2010, and 2011) and does not contain any information about future expectations, projections, or plans related to monetary policy.
2025-04-14 10:10:19,805 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses past data and trends, without referencing future projections or expectations."
}
```

This sentence appears to be describing historical data (the annual increase of the “fbkf” was 20%) and its impact on the economy (displaced household consumption as the main engine of growth), without mentioning any future outlook or projections, which is why I classified it as "not forward looking".

{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence contains future-oriented language, such as 'continue increasing the benchmark interest rate' and 'ensure convergence of inflation expectations to the goal', indicating a forward-looking statement."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "forward looking" because it discusses future actions (continuing to increase the benchmark interest rate) and desired future outcomes (convergence of inflation expectations to the goal), indicating that the statement is looking ahead to future events or policy decisions.
2025-04-14 10:10:51,102 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses past changes in market-basket components and their causes, without referencing future expectations or projections."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "not forward looking" because it analyzes past events and their effects on prices, without expressing any expectations or predictions about future developments.

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a prediction or projection about the future state of the global economy, indicating a forward-looking perspective."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "forward looking" because it discusses the future trajectory of the global economy, implying a prediction or projection about what is to come.
2025-04-14 10:10:51,102 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses future economic trends and projections based on data and surveys, indicating a forward-looking perspective."
}
```

However, upon re-reading, I realize that the sentence actually discusses past data and trends, but mentions a comparison to a previous period, and has a subtle implication of what might happen next.

A more accurate classification would be:

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence primarily discusses past data and trends, without explicitly expressing a future prediction or projection."
}
```
