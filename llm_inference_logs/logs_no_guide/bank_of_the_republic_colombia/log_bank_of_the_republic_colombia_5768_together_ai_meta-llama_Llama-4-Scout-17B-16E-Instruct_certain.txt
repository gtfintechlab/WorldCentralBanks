A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a specific and direct effect of the upside adjustment on financing conditions, indicating a certain outcome."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it states a clear and direct consequence of the upside adjustment, without expressing any doubt or ambiguity. The language used is factual and descriptive, indicating a specific impact on financing conditions, which suggests a certain outcome.
2025-04-14 10:09:33,149 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports specific numerical data and past events without expressing doubt or ambiguity."
}
```

The sentence provides concrete numbers and describes a past situation, indicating a factual report rather than a speculative or uncertain statement.
2025-04-14 10:09:33,149 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific decision made by the majority of co-directors to increase the benchmark interest rate by 25 bp, indicating a certain outcome."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it states a specific fact about the decision made by the co-directors, without expressing any doubt or ambiguity.
2025-04-14 10:09:33,149 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports on a specific meeting and decisions made, indicating a factual and certain tone."
}
```

I chose "certain" because the sentence describes a specific event and the actions taken during the meeting in a factual manner, without expressing any doubt or uncertainty.
2025-04-14 10:09:33,149 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains the phrase 'continue to support', which implies a prediction or expectation about future conditions, making the statement uncertain."
}
```

Although the sentence seems to convey a positive outlook, the use of "continue to support" implies some degree of uncertainty or prediction about future macroeconomic conditions.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words and phrases with uncertain connotations, such as 'expected', 'continue fading', and 'weaker economic activity', which indicate a lack of absolute certainty."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it expresses a prediction or expectation about future events (e.g., "are expected to continue fading") and contains vague phrases (e.g., "weaker economic activity"), which suggest a degree of uncertainty.

The sentence describes a concrete decision to maintain the benchmark interest rate at 4.25%, which indicates a certain outcome. There are no words or phrases that suggest uncertainty, such as "may", "could", or "it is likely that". The use of phrases like "the board unanimously decided" and "the board of directors unanimously decided" also suggests a high degree of certainty.

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents specific data and trends (e.g., "the total demand for electricity, which rose 2.9% annually", "petroleum production was one million fourteen thousand barrels daily on average", "an annual growth rate of 12.2% in january") without using language that suggests uncertainty or doubt. The use of phrases like "the most probable figure" does indicate some nuance

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains phrases such as 'could be somewhat lower' and 'new information in this report suggests', which indicate a degree of uncertainty or potential variability in the forecast."
}
```

This classification is based on the presence of words and phrases that suggest a lack of absolute certainty, such as "could be" and "suggests", which imply a degree of uncertainty or possibility rather than a statement of fact.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence uses the phrase 'some of the indicators' and 'point to', which implies a degree of ambiguity and uncertainty."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it uses language that suggests a degree of doubt or ambiguity, rather than making a definitive statement. The phrase "some of the indicators" implies that not all indicators are showing good momentum, and the phrase "point to" is a more tentative way of expressing a conclusion than a phrase like "show" or "indicate clearly".

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports specific, factual data about economic growth rates, indicating a certain tone."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents concrete, numerical data (e.g., "6.2%", "11.5%", "0.2%") without any ambiguous language or expressions of doubt, which suggests a factual and certain tone.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a conditional or partial improvement in conditions, using phrases like 'nevertheless' and 'partly', indicating some degree of uncertainty."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it uses words and phrases that suggest a degree of conditionality or partiality, implying that the improvement in conditions is not absolute or guaranteed.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a range of possible GDP growth values (1.5%-2.5%) and compares it to a previous range (1.5%-3.0%), indicating uncertainty about the exact growth value."
}
```

This classification is based on the presence of a range of values (1.5%-2.5%) and the comparison to a previous range, which implies that the GDP growth is not known with certainty, but rather is a prediction with some degree of uncertainty.
