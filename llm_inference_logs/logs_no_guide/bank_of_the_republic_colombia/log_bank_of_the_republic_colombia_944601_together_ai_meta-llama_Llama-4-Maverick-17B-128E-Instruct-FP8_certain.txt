A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

2025-04-14 11:07:28,965 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence discusses the inflationary situation for countries that are exporters of raw materials, stating that the situation is "more complex" due to the potential for currency depreciation accompanying a fall in prices. The language used indicates a predictive or explanatory tone rather than a statement of fact. The use of "will tend to be accompanied" suggests a forecast or expectation rather than a certainty.

Given this analysis, the classification should reflect the predictive nature of the statement.

Here's the output following the required structure:

The sentence provided is: "the above might increase capital flows to the emerging economies, thus generating currency appreciation pressures."

Let's break down the task:

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence contains the word "might," which is a modal verb used to express possibility or potentiality rather than certainty.

2. **Justification**: The use of "might" indicates that the outcome described is not definite but rather possible, hence introducing uncertainty.

Therefore, the

The sentence is: "however, there is an increase in global uncertainty that could be transmitted to these projections. the risk premia in latin america increased after the results of the elections in the united states."

First, we need to understand the key elements that might influence the classification into "certain" or "uncertain". The sentence mentions "global uncertainty" and its potential impact on projections, as well as a specific event (the results of the elections in the United States) that has already caused an increase in "risk premia in Latin America".

The sentence is: "given the possible implications that less growth in the world economy could have for colombia’s economic growth, they advised waiting for new information before making a decision on benchmark interest rates."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence implies that a decision on benchmark interest rates is being postponed due to uncertainty about the implications of global economic growth on Colombia's economy. This indicates a lack of certainty or finality in the decision-making process regarding interest rates.

2. **Justification**: The use of phrases like "possible implications" and "could have" along with the

The sentence is: "inflation excluding food remained stable (2.9%)."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence reports a specific fact about inflation excluding food, stating it "remained stable" at a precise percentage, "(2.9%)". The use of "remained stable" indicates a factual observation about a past or current state without expressing doubt or uncertainty about the information.

The sentence is: "therefore, this might suggest that this tendency may continue in the second quarter."

Let's break it down:

1. The word "might" is a modal verb that indicates possibility rather than certainty.
2. The phrase "may continue" further reinforces the idea that the continuation of the tendency is not guaranteed but is possible.

Given these observations, the sentence is expressing a possibility rather than stating a fact or a certainty about the future.

The sentence discusses economic conditions and trends in a factual manner: "in spite of this, the expansion rate across the region remains very low (-0.7% annually in the second quarter of 2013) and the weakness persists since the labor markets are still vulnerable and credit has not shown signs of recovery yet. in the united states, the economic expansion continues at a modest rate."

The sentence discusses the Bank of the Republic (Colombia)'s observations on inflation and growth, stating specific percentages and attributing the deceleration in inflation to certain factors. Although it provides factual information and data, phrases like "would have taken place, for the most part" introduce some level of interpretation or uncertainty regarding the exact timing and impact of certain economic factors.

However, the overall tone is more informative and analytical rather than speculative. The use of "would be more balanced" and "would have taken place" does indicate some level of projection or inference, but it's based on observed
