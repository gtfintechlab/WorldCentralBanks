A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a cautious tone and a wait-and-see approach, indicating uncertainty about the future economic growth and interest rate decisions."

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it mentions waiting for new information before making a decision, implying that the outcome is not yet clear.

```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents concrete information about the inflation expectations from surveys and their alignment with a specific target range, without expressing any doubt or ambiguity.
2025-04-14 11:04:42,277 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words and phrases with uncertain meanings, such as 'probably', 'will remain low', and 'trend that has been seen', indicating a lack of certainty."
}
```

The sentence is classified as "uncertain" because it contains words and phrases that convey a sense of unpredictability or doubt, such as "probably", "will remain low", and "trend that has been seen". These words suggest that the outcome is not guaranteed, and therefore, the sentence expresses an uncertain idea.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'suggests' and 'forecast', which indicate a degree of uncertainty or prediction rather than a statement of fact."
}
```

This classification is based on the presence of words that indicate a level of uncertainty or speculation, rather than a definitive statement. The use of "suggests" and "forecast" implies that the outcome is predicted or likely, but not guaranteed, which is characteristic of uncertain language.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses doubt and difficulty in assessing the excess of installed capacity and the potential impact on monetary policy, indicating uncertainty."
}
```

I chose "uncertain" because the sentence mentions that it is "difficult to assess" and there is a "risk of changing the monetary policy stance prematurely", which implies a degree of uncertainty. Although the sentence also mentions a specific action taken by two members of the board (voting for a 25 bp reduction), the overall tone of the sentence is cautious and hesitant, suggesting uncertainty.

```
{
  "label": "certain",

}
```

This sentence is classified as "certain" because it provides a concrete piece of information about a specific economic indicator (consumer inflation in April) with a precise value (2.02%) and a clear comparison to a previous value (10 basis points above March), indicating a factual report rather than a speculative or uncertain statement.

{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific and verifiable fact about retail sales, citing a precise figure and a clear trend."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents a factual report of retail sales data, without any ambiguous language or expressions of doubt. The use of a specific percentage (4.5%) and a clear reference to a downward trend beginning in 2008 suggests a statement of fact rather than an uncertain or speculative claim.

{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses uncertainty due to the use of a range of values (3.7%-4.3%) and the mention of scarce and preliminary information for 2014."

```

Although the sentence provides a specific growth rate of 4.1% as the most probable percentage for 2013, the overall tone of the sentence is cautious, and the information for 2014 is described as "very scarce and preliminary", which justifies the classification as uncertain.
2025-04-14 11:04:55,262 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports historical facts and data, using verbs in the past tense and specific dates, indicating a description of actual events rather than speculative or uncertain information."
}
```

This sentence appears to be discussing the impact of European economic trends on emerging Asian economies, citing specific data and timeframes (e.g., "since 2011", "April 2012 figures"). The language used is descriptive and factual, indicating that the events described have already occurred, which suggests certainty.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains conditional words and phrases, such as 'should continue to contribute', indicating a degree of uncertainty about future capital flows."
}
```

This sentence is classified as uncertain because it expresses a prediction or expectation about future events (capital flows into emerging economies) using words like "should", which implies a degree of uncertainty or conditionality.

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it reports a specific data point (the annual change in PPI) and a comparison between two specific values (3.7% and 5.5%), which implies a factual and verifiable statement.
2025-04-14 11:04:56,543 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

However, I noticed that the sentence does not mention the Bank of the Republic (Colombia)'s monetary policy meeting. If this is a requirement for the task, the sentence would not be relevant to the task. 

If I had to classify a sentence that is actually related to the Bank of the Republic (Colombia)'s monetary policy meeting, I would be happy
