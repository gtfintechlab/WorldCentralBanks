A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "the board of directors is mindful of the risks associated with peso appreciation in an atmosphere of weak external demand, and will continue to monitor the exchange market carefully."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence implies a cautious stance and a future action ("will continue to monitor") that is dependent on the evolving situation ("risks associated with peso appreciation" and "weak external demand"). This indicates a level of uncertainty because the outcome or the specific actions to be taken are not predetermined but are contingent on future developments.

The sentence is: "moreover, the increase in local demand has decline, but continues to exceed the growth in national production."

First, we should correct a likely typo or grammatical error in the sentence to understand it properly. It seems like it should be "the increase in local demand has declined" instead of "has decline."

After correcting the sentence to "moreover, the increase in local demand has declined, but continues to exceed the growth in national production," we can analyze its certainty.

2025-04-14 10:18:04,033 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, we need to analyze its content and tone to determine if it conveys certainty or uncertainty regarding the Bank of the Republic (Colombia)'s monetary policy meeting. However, upon closer inspection, it becomes apparent that the sentence does not directly relate to the Bank of the Republic's monetary policy meeting but rather discusses manufacturers' perceptions of problems they faced in 2012.

Despite the sentence's indirect relation to the topic, we can still assess its certainty. The sentence reports on a survey's findings regarding manufacturers' beliefs about the major problems they faced, which is a factual report of the survey's results.

Here's the classification:
2025-04-14 10:18:04,033 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and structure.

The sentence discusses the Bank of the Republic's perspective on GDP growth, mentioning two different growth projections held by different members of the board. The key phrases to focus on are "a 3.0% GDP growth would represent a positive result" and "other board members consider that GDP growth in 2015 will be closer to 3.5%, or even above." The presence of two different projections (3.0% and 3.5% or above) indicates a lack of consensus or certainty among the board members regarding the future GDP growth.

Moreover, the
2025-04-14 10:18:04,034 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and structure.

The sentence is: "these premiums could be affected by the particularly vulnerable situation in several countries of the eastern europe."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence contains the word "could," which is a modal verb often used to express possibility or potentiality rather than certainty. This indicates that the statement is not definitive.

2. **Justification**: The use of "could be affected" suggests a potential impact rather than a confirmed one, introducing uncertainty.

Therefore, the classification is as follows:

```json

  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification":
2025-04-14 10:18:04,034 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence reports on past data and a projection in a factual manner without expressing doubt or ambiguity about the information being conveyed. The projection and the historical data are presented as facts.

Therefore, the classification should be based on
2025-04-14 10:18:04,034 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and the language used.

The sentence discusses the Bank of the Republic's monetary policy meeting, mentioning two different viewpoints among the directors regarding the future of inflation and the appropriateness of the current expansionary policy stance. The first viewpoint is that deepening the current expansionary policy is unnecessary given the inflation expectations and signs of economic recovery. The second viewpoint, held by one of the directors, introduces uncertainty by suggesting it is "possible" that inflation could be on a lower trajectory and that market expectations might reflect this.

The presence of contrasting views and the use of phrases like "considered it possible"
