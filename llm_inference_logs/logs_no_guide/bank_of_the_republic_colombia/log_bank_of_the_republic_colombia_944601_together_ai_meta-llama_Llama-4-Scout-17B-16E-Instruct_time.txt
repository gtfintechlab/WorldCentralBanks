A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses the potential future impact of falling prices on the currencies of countries that are exporters of raw materials."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "forward looking" because it uses verbs like "will tend to be accompanied" that indicate a future-oriented perspective, suggesting that the sentence is discussing potential future developments rather than current or past events.
2025-04-14 11:05:29,085 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses potential future effects of an event on capital flows and currency appreciation pressures."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "forward looking" because it uses verbs like "might increase" and "generating", which indicate a prospective or predictive tone, suggesting that the sentence is discussing potential future outcomes.

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a current or past fact about inflation, without referencing future expectations or projections."
}
```

This sentence is not forward looking because it simply states a fact about the current state of inflation, without expressing a prediction or expectation about future inflation.

Let me know if you'd like me to explain further! 

However, I can also see how one might argue that this sentence is describing past events (e.g. "have been relatively stable", "were announced"), but the key phrase here is "a possible reduction... was announced", which does imply some forward-looking discussion, even if it is describing a past announcement about a potential future

The sentence only mentions past data and trends, specifically the consumer confidence index in April and May 2013, and its comparison to historical averages, without referencing any future expectations or projections, which is why it is classified as "not forward looking".

I chose "not forward looking" because the sentence reports on past or current economic data (e.g., "-0.7% annually in the second quarter of 2013", "the labor markets are still vulnerable", "credit has not shown signs of recovery yet") without expressing expectations or projections about future economic developments.
