A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

It directly links the "upside adjustment" to "tightening financing conditions" as a consequence.

The sentence provided is: "the annual variation in eating was down again, although slightly, reaching 4.9%within the non-food cpi, the regulated sub-basket posted an annual variation of 1.9% (88 bp less than in november)."

This sentence reports on specific economic data points, such as the annual variation in eating and the regulated sub-basket's performance, with precise figures.

To determine if it's certain or uncertain, we need to assess if the language used indicates a clear, factual report or if it includes ambiguity or speculation.

2025-04-14 10:11:55,725 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and structure.

The sentence states: "the causes and consequences of this phenomenon were discussed by the members of the board to determine their position regarding the monetary policy stance. the majority of co-directors voted in favor of increasing the benchmark interest rate by 25 bp."

First, we observe that the sentence is actually two separate sentences that are not properly connected with punctuation. However, understanding them together is crucial for the task.

1. The first part mentions a discussion among the board members about a phenomenon and its implications for monetary policy stance. This part is neutral and doesn't directly indicate the outcome or
2025-04-14 10:11:55,725 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence reports on the attendance and discussions at a meeting of the Banco de la RepÃºblica, including the topics discussed and decisions made regarding monetary policy. It states that "decisions on monetary policy were reached," indicating a conclusion or outcome of the meeting.

Given this, the classification can be determined as follows:

```json
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports on decisions that were made, indicating a clear outcome without expressing doubt or uncertainty."
}

The sentence is: "for 2011, macroeconomic conditions continue to support an important economic growth."

Let's break it down:

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence is stating a fact or a condition without expressing doubt. It directly mentions that macroeconomic conditions "continue to support" economic growth, which implies a level of confidence or assertion about the state of the economy.

2. **Justification**: The use of "continue to support" indicates a
