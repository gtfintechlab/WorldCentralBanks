A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses past data and trends, without referencing future expectations or projections."
}
```

The sentence only mentions past data and trends, specifically the consumer confidence index in April and May 2013, and its comparison to historical averages, without referencing any future expectations or projections, which is why it is classified as "not forward looking".
2025-04-14 10:15:32,104 - together_inference - INFO - Response: ```

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence reports on past data and trends, without expressing a prediction or projection about future events or policies."
}
```

This sentence is not forward looking because it discusses past growth rates and trends in the loan portfolio, providing specific data for previous periods (February and December), without making any statements about future expectations or projections.

I classified the sentence as "forward looking" because it discusses potential future changes to monetary policy, indicating a focus on what is to come rather than reporting on past or current events.
