A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "this upside adjustment, driven by enduring global inflation pressures, tightens financing conditions for the colombian economy."

1. **Understanding the sentence**: The sentence discusses the effect of an "upside adjustment" on the Colombian economy's financing conditions, attributing this adjustment to ongoing global inflation pressures.

2. **Determining if it's forward looking**: A statement is considered "forward looking" if it implies or directly discusses future events, conditions, or outcomes. The key verb here is "tightens," which is in the present tense but implies a consequence that is
2025-04-14 10:12:51,416 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and context.

The sentence provided is: "the annual variation in eating was down again, although slightly, reaching 4.9%within the non-food cpi, the regulated sub-basket posted an annual variation of 1.9% (88 bp less than in november)."

This sentence discusses past data regarding the annual variation in certain components of the Consumer Price Index (CPI), specifically mentioning that the variations are down compared to previous periods (e.g., November). The focus is on reporting historical inflation data without directly or indirectly hinting at future monetary policy decisions or expectations.

2025-04-14 10:12:51,416 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and implications regarding the Bank of the Republic (Colombia)'s monetary policy meeting.

The sentence provided is: "the causes and consequences of this phenomenon were discussed by the members of the board to determine their position regarding the monetary policy stance. the majority of co-directors voted in favor of increasing the benchmark interest rate by 25 bp."

First, we need to understand what "forward looking" means in the context of monetary policy discussions. Forward-looking statements are those that imply or directly state future actions, expectations, or decisions regarding monetary policy.

First, we need to understand what "forward looking" means in this context. A statement is considered "forward looking" if it contains information or hints about future events, expectations, or decisions that will influence future outcomes.

The sentence is: "the commercial loan portfolio is the one least subject to supply constraints."

This sentence describes a current state or general condition regarding the commercial loan portfolio without explicitly mentioning future expectations or changes. It does not directly indicate a direction or expectation for future monetary policy or economic conditions.

Therefore, the classification is as follows:

Therefore, the classification should be based on whether the sentence looks forward or discusses past or current states.

The sentence is: "international prices for food, raw materials and oil continue to decline."

Let's break it down:

1. The verb "continue" indicates an ongoing action.
2. The action is "to decline," which is happening to international prices.

Since the sentence describes an ongoing situation or a current trend rather than explicitly forecasting or predicting future events, it is more about the current state or a recent trend.

Therefore, the classification is as follows:

The sentence discusses the attendance at a meeting and summarizes the main monetary policy discussions considered by the board. The key phrase here is "the main monetary policy discussions considered by the board are summarized as follows," which indicates that the sentence is introducing a summary of past discussions rather than making a statement about future actions or expectations.

The sentence discusses data from the second quarter of 2015 and its implications on private consumption, comparing it to the rate at the beginning of the year. Although it mentions "the survey of economic expectations," this is referring to a past survey (from the second quarter of 2015) and is used to understand past or current economic activity rather than directly forecasting future actions or conditions.

Given this, the sentence is primarily discussing past or current data and its implications, rather than directly looking forward to future monetary policy decisions or economic conditions.

Therefore, the classification is as follows:
