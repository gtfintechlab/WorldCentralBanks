A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence discusses the stability of interest rates for American Treasury bonds at levels higher than those before May, when a possible reduction in the monetary stimulus by the Fed was announced. This context is related to the US Federal Reserve's (Fed) monetary policy rather than directly to the Bank of the Republic (Colombia)'s policy. However, the Fed's actions and signals can influence other central banks' decisions due to the global economic interconnectedness.

Given this, let's analyze the sentence:
