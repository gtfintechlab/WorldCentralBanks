A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports factual information about household credit trends, using specific data and comparisons to inflation and nominal GDP growth, indicating a statement of fact rather than uncertainty."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents specific, factual information about household credit trends, using phrases like "has slowed", "keeps increasing", and "exceed inflation and growth of nominal GDP", which suggest a statement of objective fact rather than a uncertain or speculative claim.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses mixed signals and does not make a definitive statement about the outcome of the Bank of the Republic's monetary policy meeting."
}
```

However, I realized that the sentence does not mention the Bank of the Republic's monetary policy meeting at all. It seems to be a general statement about economic indicators. 

If that's the case, the task doesn't make sense. But if I had to classify the sentence regarding the certainty of the information it provides:

}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents a clear and definitive statement about the sectoral performance, without using words or phrases that indicate uncertainty, such as "may", "could", "suggests", or "it is likely that". The language used is descriptive and assertive, indicating a report of actual conditions rather than speculative or uncertain ones.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains phrases that indicate uncertainty, such as 'will continue converging' and 'what is relevant at this time', which suggest a degree of unpredictability."
}
```

Although the sentence mentions a specific action taken by one member of the board (voting in favor of maintaining the intervention rate unchanged), the overall tone of the sentence is more aligned with uncertainty due to the use of future-oriented language and conditional phrases.
2025-04-14 10:14:46,114 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence uses a definitive statement with a specific date, indicating a clear and planned action."
}
```

The sentence is classified as "certain" because it states a specific action that will be taken (closing reverse-repo auctions) at a specific date (Monday, October 27), leaving no room for doubt or ambiguity.
2025-04-14 10:14:46,114 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains the word 'expected', which indicates a degree of uncertainty or prediction rather than a statement of fact."
}
```

This classification is based on the presence of the word "expected", which suggests that the outcome is not guaranteed, but rather a forecast or prediction. This implies a level of uncertainty, rather than certainty.
2025-04-14 10:14:46,114 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes specific factors that influenced a decision, implying a clear understanding of their impact."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it mentions specific factors (hikes in external interest rates, higher risk premia, and volatility in international financial markets) that influenced a decision, suggesting that their impact is known and well-defined.
2025-04-14 10:14:46,114 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a clear intention and decision of the board of directors to monitor the exchange market carefully, without expressing any doubt or ambiguity."
}
```

Although the sentence mentions "risks" and "weak external demand", which could be seen as uncertain factors, the tone of the sentence is resolute and assertive regarding the board's intention to monitor the exchange market, hence the classification as "certain".
2025-04-14 10:14:47,576 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a prediction about a future outcome, using the phrase 'would be less than', which implies a degree of uncertainty."
}
```

This sentence is classified as uncertain because it contains a conditional verb phrase ("would be") that suggests a prediction or expectation, rather than a statement of fact.
2025-04-14 10:14:47,576 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains the words 'probably' and 'slightly', which indicate a degree of uncertainty and imprecision in the statement."
}
```

The presence of words like "probably" and "slightly" suggests that the statement is not a definitive prediction, but rather a probabilistic one, which is a clear indicator of uncertainty.
2025-04-14 10:14:47,576 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports specific data and comparisons, indicating a factual and certain statement about the growth of total imports in dollars."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "certain" because it presents concrete numbers and comparisons, indicating a factual report rather than a speculative or uncertain statement.

This sentence presents concrete numbers and statements about changes in sales and imports, without any language indicating uncertainty, such as "may," "could," or "is expected to." The use of specific percentages (e.g., "22.5%", "11%", "-18.4%") also suggests a factual report rather than a speculative or uncertain statement.

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it uses a factual tone and describes a past event without expressing doubt or uncertainty. The phrase "as occurred throughout the year" and "was explained" suggests a level of confidence and definiteness, indicating that the sentence is stating a fact rather than expressing uncertainty.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific historical event with a clear date and location, indicating a factual and certain occurrence."
}
```

This sentence can be classified as certain because it simply states a fact about a specific event that occurred on a particular date and location, without any ambiguity or uncertainty.
2025-04-14 10:14:50,727 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a need for more information prior to modifying the current monetary policy stance and highlights ongoing economic uncertainties."
}
```

This classification is based on the presence of phrases such as "continued uncertainty", "need for more information", and "prior to modifying", which indicate a lack of confidence or certainty about future policy actions.
2025-04-14 10:14:50,727 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence is stated in a definitive tone, using the phrase 'will have been', which implies a level of confidence and certainty about future events."
}
```

However, I can also argue that:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence makes a prediction about the future performance of various sectors, which inherently involves some degree of uncertainty."
}
```

Upon reevaluating, I think the second option is more suitable, as the sentence does make a prediction about the future.

So, the final output

The sentence expresses a possibility rather than a fact, which is why I classified it as uncertain.

{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a general statement about the potential risks of low interest rates, using the phrase 'can pose a risk', which implies a level of certainty about the potential consequences."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because, although it uses the word "can", which might suggest some uncertainty, the phrase as a whole expresses a well-established economic concept and the potential risks are presented as a likely outcome, rather than a speculative or uncertain one.

{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'surprisingly' and 'slightly below their potential', which indicate uncertainty and variability in the described economic trends."
}
```

The sentence is classified as "uncertain" because it includes words and phrases that suggest unpredictability and imprecision, such as "surprisingly" and "slightly below their potential". This kind of language indicates that the described economic trends are not entirely clear-cut or predictable, which is characteristic of uncertain statements.

Although the sentence provides a specific growth range and a most probable percentage for 2013, it explicitly states that information for 2014 is scarce and preliminary, implying uncertainty about the economic situation in 2014. However, I focused on the overall assessment that the text allows for a range and a most likely value for 2013 but clearly states uncertainty for 2014; still, the presence of "very scarce

However, upon re-reading, I think a more accurate classification would be:

{

I chose "uncertain" because the sentence discusses ongoing trends and expected effects of monetary policy, using phrases like "is still affecting", "is beginning to manifest itself", which imply a degree of uncertainty about future outcomes.
2025-04-14 10:15:02,576 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

However, I can also argue that:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence uses the word 'remain' and 'encourage', which implies a level of prediction or expectation about future events."
}
```

Upon re-reading, I think the second classification is more accurate, as the sentence does imply some level of expectation or prediction about the future.

A more accurate classification would be:

  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports specific data points (6.6% and 4.5% growth rates) that indicate a factual and certain state of affairs."
