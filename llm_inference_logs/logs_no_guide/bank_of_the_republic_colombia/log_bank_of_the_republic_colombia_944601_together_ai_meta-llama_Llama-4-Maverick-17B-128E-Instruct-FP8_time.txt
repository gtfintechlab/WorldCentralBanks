A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "the above might increase capital flows to the emerging economies, thus generating currency appreciation pressures."

1. **Understanding the Sentence**: The sentence discusses a potential future outcome ("might increase") related to capital flows and its consequence on currency.

2. **Identifying Forward-Looking Elements**: The key phrase here is "might increase," which indicates a possibility or prediction about a future event. The sentence is discussing a potential future scenario and its effects.

2025-04-14 11:08:33,183 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and implications regarding the Bank of the Republic (Colombia)'s monetary policy meeting.

The sentence is: "however, there is an increase in global uncertainty that could be transmitted to these projections. the risk premia in latin america increased after the results of the elections in the united states."

First, we need to understand what "forward looking" means in this context. A forward-looking statement is one that implies or directly discusses future events, projections, or expectations.

2025-04-14 11:08:33,183 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, we need to analyze its content and determine whether it refers to future events or current/past situations.

The sentence is: "inflation excluding food remained stable (2.9%)."

Let's break it down:

1. **Understanding the sentence**: The sentence reports on the state of inflation excluding food, stating it "remained stable" at 2.9%. The verb "remained" indicates a condition that has been maintained over a period, suggesting a look back at past data.

2. **Determining the label**:
   - **Forward looking**: Sentences that are forward looking typically discuss future expectations,
