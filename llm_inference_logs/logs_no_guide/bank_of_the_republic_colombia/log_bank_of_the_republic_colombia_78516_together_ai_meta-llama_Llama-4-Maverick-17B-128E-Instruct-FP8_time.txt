A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "in the last few months, household credit has slowed, but keeps increasing at rates that exceed inflation and growth of nominal gdp."

1. **Understanding the task**: We need to determine if the sentence is "forward looking" or "not forward looking" in the context of the Bank of the Republic (Colombia)'s monetary policy meeting. "Forward looking" statements typically refer to future expectations, predictions, or guidance.

2. **Analyzing the sentence**: The sentence discusses the recent trend in household credit, stating it has slowed down but continues to
2025-04-14 10:18:16,709 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and context.

The sentence discusses the consumer confidence index (CCI) and indicators associated with supply, mentioning their current or past states ("shows higher levels in April and May than those observed in the first three months of 2013") but does not directly imply future actions, expectations, or predictions that would directly influence or reflect the Bank of the Republic's future monetary policy decisions.

Given this, the classification is as follows:

The sentence is: "(v) the measurements of core inflation continue to rise and the majority are surpassing 3%."

First, we need to understand what "forward looking" means in the context of monetary policy discussions. Forward-looking statements typically refer to future expectations, predictions, or guidance related to economic conditions or policy decisions.

Now, let's examine the sentence:

- It mentions "the measurements of core inflation continue to rise," which indicates an ongoing trend.
- It also states that "the majority are surpassing 3%," providing a current status relative to a specific

The sentence provided is: "there has been no growth in the balance of the loan portfolio in domestic currency during the last eight (8) weeks (15.8% annual growth at the end of february compared to 18.5% in december)."

1. **Understanding the task**: We need to determine if the sentence is "forward looking" or "not forward looking" in the context of the Bank of the Republic (Colombia)'s monetary policy meeting.

The sentence provided is: "sectoral performance has been irregular, with stagnation or decline in primary and secondary sectors and growth in the tertiary sector."

1. **Understanding the Sentence**: The sentence discusses the performance of different sectors of the economy (primary, secondary, and tertiary) in a retrospective manner, highlighting that their performance has been irregular. It specifically mentions that some sectors have stagnated or declined, while others have grown.

2. **Analyzing the Content**: The key aspect to determine is whether the sentence is looking forward or backward. The verb tense used is "has

First, let's break down the key elements:
1. The sentence mentions an expectation about future inflation behavior ("inflation will continue converging to its target"), indicating a projection or forecast.
2. It discusses the relevance of providing
2025-04-14 10:18:18,409 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and implications.

The sentence is: "reverse-repo auctions through remunerated deposits not subject to reserve requirements will be closed temporarily as of monday, october 27."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence is discussing a future action ("will be closed temporarily") that is scheduled to happen at a specific date ("as of monday, october 27"). This indicates it is referring to a future event or decision.

2. **Justification**: The sentence is classified based on whether it looks forward, i.e., whether it contains information about future events or decisions.

Given that the sentence announces
2025-04-14 10:18:18,409 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze it step by step.

The sentence is: "as a result, the pace of consumption observed in the second quarter is expected to continue."

1. **Understanding the task**: We need to determine if the sentence is "forward looking" or "not forward looking" based on its content and the context of a monetary policy meeting.

2. **Analyzing the sentence**: The sentence mentions "the pace of consumption observed in the second quarter is expected to continue." The key phrase here is "is expected to continue," which indicates a projection or expectation about the future.

1. **Understanding the sentence**: The sentence discusses factors that influenced a decision, likely related to monetary policy given the context of the Bank of the Republic (Colombia). It mentions "hikes in external interest rates, higher risk premia and the volatility in international financial markets."

2. **Analyzing the tense and implications**:

The sentence is discussing a slowdown in the economy that is being confirmed by indicators. The key here is understanding the tense and implications of "slowdown" and how it relates to the timing of the statement.

Given that the sentence does not explicitly mention future actions, plans, or predictions but rather states a current observation or fact ("confirm the slowdown"), it suggests that the slowdown is either ongoing or has already occurred.
