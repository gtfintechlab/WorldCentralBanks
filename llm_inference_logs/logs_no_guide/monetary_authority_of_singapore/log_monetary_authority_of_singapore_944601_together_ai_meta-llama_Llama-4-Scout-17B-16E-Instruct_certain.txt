A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'expected' and 'remains subdued', which indicate a degree of uncertainty or prediction rather than a statement of fact."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it expresses a prediction or expectation about future events (the trade-related cluster contracting further) and uses words that convey a degree of doubt or unpredictability.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains the word 'expected', which indicates a degree of uncertainty or prediction rather than a statement of fact."
}
```

This classification is based on the presence of the word "expected", which suggests that the outcome is predicted or forecasted, but not yet confirmed, thereby introducing uncertainty.

{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a factual state of the manufacturing sector without expressing any doubt or ambiguity."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents a clear and definitive statement about the manufacturing sector's performance, without using words or phrases that indicate uncertainty, such as "may", "could", "likely", or "it is expected that". The language used is factual and descriptive, indicating a certain state of affairs.
2025-04-15 00:02:29,533 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains the word 'only gradually', which implies a degree of uncertainty and prediction about future inflation, rather than a definitive statement."
}
```

Alternatively, I could also justify it with:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence uses the phrase 'will rise only gradually', which is a forecast and not a statement of fact, indicating uncertainty about future events."
}
```

Both justifications convey the same idea that the sentence is uncertain because it makes a prediction about the future.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a projection with specific numerical values, indicating a degree of confidence and certainty about future inflation rates."
}
```

Although the sentence mentions a range for 2019 (1-2%), which might suggest some uncertainty, the overall tone and use of specific numbers suggest that the statement is intended to convey a certain expectation about future inflation rates. 

However, an alternative and reasonable classification could be:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence includes a range of values (1-2%)

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a factual observation about the current state of imported price pressures, using phrases that indicate a clear and established trend."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents information as a fact, without expressing any doubt or ambiguity. The use of phrases such as "have generally been muted" and "in line with" suggests a clear and established trend, indicating a certain state of affairs.
2025-04-15 00:02:39,452 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my response:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains the word 'should', which indicates a degree of uncertainty or prediction rather than a statement of fact."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because the use of "should" implies a forecast or prediction, rather than a definitive statement. This suggests that there is some degree of uncertainty or conditionality associated with the expected outcome.
2025-04-15 00:02:39,452 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my response:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a cause-and-effect relationship using a definitive tone, indicating a predictable outcome."
}
```

However, I can also argue that:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'some' and 'would lead', indicating a degree of uncertainty and conditionality."
}
```

Upon re-reading, I think the second response is more accurate. The sentence does express a conditional relationship and uses the word "some", which implies a degree of uncertainty.

So, the final response

  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a clear expectation about the future impact of oil price shocks on consumer prices, using the phrase 'we do not expect' to convey a sense of confidence in their prediction."

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains the phrase 'we do not expect', but the future is inherently uncertain, and the sentence's prediction about the absence of further price increases beyond a certain point implies some degree of uncertainty."
