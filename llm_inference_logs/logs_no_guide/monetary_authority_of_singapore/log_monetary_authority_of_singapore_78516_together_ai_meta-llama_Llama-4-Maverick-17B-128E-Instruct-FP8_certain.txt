A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

However, upon closer inspection, it becomes apparent that the sentence does not directly relate to the Monetary Authority of Singapore's monetary policy meeting but rather reports on the Singapore economy's growth.

Given this, let's assess the sentence: "mtiâ€™s advance estimates show that the singapore economy expanded by 1.0% on a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis in q3 2023, up from 0.1% in q2."

The sentence is reporting a
2025-04-14 23:59:15,295 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, we need to analyze its content and tone to determine if it expresses certainty or uncertainty regarding the Monetary Authority of Singapore's monetary policy or related economic conditions.

The sentence is: "on the domestic front, the improving labour market should underpin a faster pace of wage growth in 2018 and 2019 compared to last year."

Let's break it down:

1. **Label**: The sentence uses the word "should," which indicates a degree of expectation or prediction rather than a statement of fact. This suggests that the outcome is not guaranteed but is considered likely based on current conditions.

2. **Justification**:
2025-04-14 23:59:15,295 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "as part of its ongoing economic surveillance, mas has assessed that it is appropriate to adjust the prevailing stance."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence implies a decision has been made based on an assessment. The use of "has assessed" indicates a completed action, and "it is appropriate" suggests a conclusion has been reached.

2. **Justification**: The language used is definitive, indicating a clear decision or stance has been taken by MAS, hence the classification as "certain".

Therefore, the output is:

The sentence is: "mas is also restoring a narrower policy band."

Let's break it down:

1. **Statement Nature**: The sentence is a declarative statement, directly stating an action being taken by the MAS.

2. **Language Used**: The language used is straightforward and factual, indicating a specific action ("restoring a narrower policy band") attributed to the MAS.

3. **Tone and Implication**: The tone is informative, and the statement implies that the action is
2025-04-14 23:59:15,295 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, we need to analyze its content and determine whether it expresses a certain or uncertain outcome regarding the Monetary Authority of Singapore's monetary policy meeting.

The sentence is: "at the same time, inflationary pressures are likely to pick up, driven by rising global commodity prices as well as some domestic cost factors."

1. **Label Assignment**: The key phrase here is "are likely to pick up," which indicates a probability rather than a certainty.

2. **Justification**: The use of "likely to" suggests that the occurrence of inflationary pressures picking up is not definite but rather probable, hence introducing uncertainty.

2025-04-14 23:59:29,624 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, we need to analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "a sharp escalation in geopolitical and trade conflicts could exert sizeable drags on global and domestic investment and trade."

Let's break it down:

1. The sentence discusses a hypothetical scenario ("a sharp escalation in geopolitical and trade conflicts").
2. It uses the word "could," which is a conditional verb indicating possibility rather than certainty.

Given these observations, the sentence is discussing a potential outcome of a specific event rather than stating a fact or a certain outcome.

Therefore, the classification should be:

The sentence is: "inflation for certain services components, including public transport and healthcare, could also stay elevated as less frequently-adjusted prices rise to catch up with higher cost levels."

Let's break it down:

1. The sentence discusses a potential future state ("could also stay elevated") rather than stating a fact.
2. The use of "could" indicates possibility rather than certainty.

Given these observations, the sentence is expressing uncertainty about future inflation for certain services components.

The sentence is: "barring a resurgence of the virus globally or a setback in the pace of economic reopening, output should return to around its potential in 2022."

Let's break it down:

1. **Label**: The sentence contains conditional language ("barring a resurgence of the virus globally or a setback in the pace of economic reopening"), which indicates that the outcome is dependent on certain conditions being met.
2025-04-14 23:59:29,624 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence discusses the potential support for the recovery in certain sectors due to specific factors like the turnaround in the electronics cycle and the anticipated easing in global interest rates. It also mentions the normalization of growth in domestic-oriented sectors towards pre-pandemic rates.

The key phrases to focus on are "should be supported" and "anticipated easing," which indicate a level of expectation rather than certainty. The use of "should" suggests a prediction or an expectation rather than a statement of fact, and "anticipated" directly implies looking forward to something that has not yet happened.

Given this

The sentence is: "barring any unexpected shocks in the external environment, the singapore economy is forecast to expand at between 4-6% this year."

1. The phrase "barring any unexpected shocks" introduces a condition that could affect the forecast, indicating a level of uncertainty.
2. The phrase "is forecast to expand" suggests a prediction based on current information, which inherently carries some degree of uncertainty.
3. The range "between 4-6%" further indicates a lack of precision in the forecast.

The sentence is: "nevertheless, it will take time for the expansion to gather momentum and become more broad-based, before a significant improvement in the labour market can be seen."

Let's break it down:

1. The sentence discusses future events and their timing ("it will take time", "before a significant improvement... can be seen"), indicating a projection or expectation rather than a statement of fact.
2. The use of "nevertheless" suggests a contrast or a continuation of a discussion, implying that the outcome or the timing is dependent on certain conditions or previous statements
