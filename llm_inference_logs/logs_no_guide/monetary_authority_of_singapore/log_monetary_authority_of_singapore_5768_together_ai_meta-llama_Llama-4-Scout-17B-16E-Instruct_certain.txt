A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific projection with a defined range, indicating a certain prediction about the future inflation rate."
}
```

Although the sentence mentions a range (3.0-4.0%), which might seem uncertain, the range itself is a specific prediction, and the tone of the sentence suggests a level of confidence in this projection. The use of "now projected" also implies a level of certainty about the forecast.
2025-04-14 23:50:46,420 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a specific historical event and its consequence, using precise language and without expressing doubt or ambiguity."
}
```

The sentence reports a factual event that occurred on a specific date, and the consequence of that event (the appreciation of the S$NEER) is stated as a matter of fact, without any hedging or uncertainty. This suggests that the sentence is making a certain statement.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a clear and definitive future action, indicating a specific policy change with no ambiguity."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it uses a direct and assertive tone, stating a specific action that will be taken ("we will shift the policy band"), without any hedging or indication of doubt.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence uses a definitive statement with a clear cause-and-effect relationship, indicating a certain outcome."

```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it uses a direct and assertive tone, implying that the passing through of accumulating business costs to consumer price inflation is a predictable and inevitable consequence of the domestic economy reopening and private consumption recovering.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports specific data and facts about interest rates, without any ambiguous language or expressions of doubt."

```

This sentence simply states facts about the interest rates, providing specific numbers and changes, without any indication of uncertainty or speculation. Therefore, it is classified as certain.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes past events and factual situations, indicating a tone of certainty."

```

The sentence discusses specific past events, such as the raise in water charges and excise duty on tobacco, and describes the situation of being a price taker for oil imports, which are verifiable facts, hence certain.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains the phrase 'will narrow through the course of 2021', which implies a prediction about a future event, making it uncertain."

```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it expresses a prediction about a future event (the narrowing of the negative output gap in 2021), which may or may not materialize as expected.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "Although the sentence makes a prediction about the future, the language used is assertive and implies a high degree of confidence."
}
```

Alternatively, I could classify it as uncertain:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence uses the word 'likely', which indicates a degree of uncertainty rather than absolute certainty."
}
```

The sentence expresses a prediction about future external inflationary pressures, but the use of "likely" suggests that there is some uncertainty associated with this prediction, rather than a guarantee.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a factual observation about China's growth momentum and investment growth, without any ambiguous language or uncertainty."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents a statement as a fact, without any hedging or uncertainty. The use of the phrase "is easing" and "sharp deceleration" implies a clear and observable trend, suggesting that the sentence is reporting a known circumstance rather than a speculative or uncertain one.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words and phrases that indicate uncertainty, such as 'however', 'around', and 'indications of some stabilisation', which suggest a lack of absolute confidence."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it contains words and phrases that indicate a degree of uncertainty or imprecision, such as "however", "around", and "indications of some stabilisation". These words suggest that the speaker is not entirely confident in their statement, and is instead expressing a nuanced or provisional view.

{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'expected', 'easing further', and 'towards the end of the year', which indicate a degree of uncertainty and prediction rather than a statement of fact."
}
```

This classification is based on the presence of words and phrases that suggest a level of uncertainty, prediction, or forecast, rather than a definitive statement. The use of "expected" and "towards" implies a degree of uncertainty, making the sentence uncertain rather than certain.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'expected' and 'will constrain', which indicate a degree of uncertainty or prediction rather than a statement of fact."
}
```

The sentence is classified as uncertain because it expresses a prediction or expectation about future events (moderate price increases, extent of cost pass-through) rather than stating a fact. The use of words like "expected" and "will constrain" also implies a degree of uncertainty or conditionality.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a reflection of market expectations, implying a level of confidence or certainty about the expected interest rate hikes and currency movements."
}
```

However, upon re-reading, I realize that the sentence is more about describing market expectations rather than stating a fact with absolute certainty. The use of "reflected market expectations" and "at a time of general appreciation" suggests a degree of uncertainty. 

Here is the revised classification:

{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'expected' and 'filtered through', which indicate a degree of uncertainty or prediction rather than a statement of fact."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it expresses a prediction or expectation about future events (e.g., CPI inflation picking up) rather than stating a fact. The use of words like "expected" and "filtered through" also suggests a degree of uncertainty or conditionality.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'likely' and 'should', which indicate a degree of uncertainty or prediction rather than a definitive statement."
}
```

This sentence is classified as uncertain because it uses probabilistic language ("likely", "should") and makes predictions about future events, rather than stating facts with complete confidence.

  "justification": "The sentence presents specific inflation rate projections with a clear range, indicating a certain prediction about future inflation."
}
```

Although the sentence mentions "would remain", which might suggest some degree of uncertainty, the specific inflation rate ranges provided (2.5–3.5% and 4.5–5.5%) imply a level of confidence and certainty about the projections.

```

However, upon re-reading, I realize that the sentence also contains phrases like "is expected to" which indicate some level of uncertainty. Therefore, a more accurate classification would be:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a forecasted expectation about the future inflation rate, using phrases like 'is expected to', which implies some level of uncertainty

```
{

```

This classification is based on the language used in the sentence, which suggests that the outcome is not guaranteed but rather forecasted with some degree of uncertainty. The use of "expected to" and "slightly below" implies a range of possible outcomes rather than a definitive statement, leading to the classification as "uncertain".
