A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

2025-04-15 00:00:15,935 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and context.

The sentence is: "mtiâ€™s advance estimates show that the singapore economy expanded by 1.0% on a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis in q3 2023, up from 0.1% in q2."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence reports on the past performance of the Singapore economy, specifically comparing the growth rates in Q3 2023 and Q2 2023. It does not make any statements about future expectations, predictions, or intentions regarding monetary policy or economic performance.

2. **Justification**: The sentence
2025-04-15 00:00:15,935 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, we need to analyze its content and determine if it refers to future events or conditions.

The sentence is: "on the domestic front, the improving labour market should underpin a faster pace of wage growth in 2018 and 2019 compared to last year."

Here's the step-by-step thought process:
1. The sentence mentions specific years (2018 and 2019) in relation to the pace of wage growth.
2. It implies a prediction or expectation about future wage growth based on the current state of the labour market.
3. The mention of "compared to last year" further grounds the statement
2025-04-15 00:00:15,935 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and implications.

The sentence is: "as part of its ongoing economic surveillance, mas has assessed that it is appropriate to adjust the prevailing stance."

1. **Understanding the sentence**: The sentence mentions that the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has made an assessment regarding adjusting its prevailing monetary policy stance as part of its economic surveillance.

2. **Determining if it's forward looking**: A statement is considered "forward looking" if it implies or discusses future actions, expectations, or conditions. The key phrase here is "it is appropriate to adjust the prevailing stance," which indicates a decision or intention regarding
2025-04-15 00:00:15,935 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, "mas is also restoring a narrower policy band," we need to analyze its content and determine if it implies a future action or state.

The sentence implies an action that has been taken or is being taken ("is also restoring") regarding the policy band, which directly relates to the Monetary Authority of Singapore's (MAS) monetary policy. The action of restoring a narrower policy band indicates a change in the current state of monetary policy, suggesting that the MAS is taking or has taken a specific action.

However, the key to determining if it's "forward looking" lies in understanding whether the statement implies future implications or effects.
2025-04-15 00:00:15,935 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and implications.

The sentence is: "at the same time, inflationary pressures are likely to pick up, driven by rising global commodity prices as well as some domestic cost factors."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence implies a future expectation or prediction regarding inflationary pressures. The phrase "are likely to pick up" indicates a forward-looking statement as it discusses a probable future development.

2. **Justification**: The sentence is classified as "forward looking" because it contains the phrase "are likely to pick up," which indicates a prediction or expectation about future inflationary pressures.

The sentence is: "despite some pickup in labour costs, inflationary pressures are mild and should remain contained."

Let's break it down:

1. The phrase "should remain contained" indicates a future expectation or prediction regarding inflationary pressures.
   
Given this analysis, the classification is as follows:

{
"label": "forward looking",
"justification": "The sentence is forward looking because it contains the phrase 'should remain contained', indicating a future expectation regarding inflationary pressures."
