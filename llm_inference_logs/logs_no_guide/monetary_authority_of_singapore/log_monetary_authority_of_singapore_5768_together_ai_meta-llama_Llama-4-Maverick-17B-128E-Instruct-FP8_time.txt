A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "for 2018, core inflation should come in within the upper half of the 1–2% forecast range."

Let's break it down:

1. The sentence mentions a specific year, "2018", which indicates a future time frame relative to the context in which the sentence is likely being used (since the sentence is related to a monetary policy meeting, it's reasonable to assume it's from a year before or around 2018).

The sentence is: "mas core inflation has stepped down but is anticipated to decline further to around 2% by the end of 2024."

Let's break it down:

1. The sentence mentions an expectation about future inflation ("is anticipated to decline further").
2. It specifies a future time frame ("by the end of 2024") and a projected value ("around 2%").

Given these observations, the sentence clearly refers to a future state or expectation.

The sentence is: "in comparison, the domestic-oriented sectors should expand at a moderate pace, underpinned by sustained demand for healthcare and education services, as well as public infrastructure spending."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence implies a prediction or expectation about future economic activity ("should expand at a moderate pace"), which indicates it is discussing future prospects or outlook.

2. **Justification**: The sentence is considered forward-looking because it contains a projection about the future performance of domestic-oriented sectors.
