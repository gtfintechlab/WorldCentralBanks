A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "the trade-weighted s$neer trended up initially in h2 2001, reflecting in part a marked weakening of the us$ as data showed a sharper-than-expected slowdown in the us economy."

This sentence is reporting historical data and facts. It describes a past event or trend without expressing doubt or ambiguity about the information being presented.

Therefore, the classification should be based on the certainty of the statement.

Here's the output:

The sentence is: "it aimed to cap medium-term inflationary pressures, while continuing to be supportive of economic activity as growth came off its cyclical high and moderated to a slower pace."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence describes a past action and its rationale with a clear understanding of the economic context (growth coming off its cyclical high and moderating). The language used is definitive regarding the aim and the context.

2025-04-15 00:04:40,551 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze it step by step.

The sentence is: "in europe too growth has weakened more than expected."

1. **Understanding the sentence**: The sentence discusses the state of growth in Europe, stating it has weakened more than anticipated.

2. **Identifying certainty or uncertainty**: The phrase "more than expected" indicates a comparison between an actual outcome (the weakening of growth) and an anticipated outcome. This comparison doesn't inherently suggest uncertainty about the fact that growth has weakened, but it does imply that the extent of the weakening was not entirely anticipated.

3. **Classifying the sentence**: The sentence is stating a
2025-04-15 00:04:40,551 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and structure.

The sentence discusses the expected growth in Singapore's major trading partners and mentions that the timing and extent of the recovery are subject to significant uncertainty. The presence of the phrase "subject to significant uncertainty" directly indicates a level of doubt or unpredictability regarding the recovery's timing and extent.

Given this analysis, the classification should reflect the uncertainty expressed in the sentence.

Here's the output following the required structure:

```

The sentence is: "while singapore’s growth momentum was expected to slow, mas had assessed that it was prudent to tighten further and lean against price pressures becoming more persistent."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence reports on a past assessment made by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) regarding its monetary policy action. The key phrase "MAS had assessed" indicates a past decision or judgment, and the use of "was expected" and "was prudent" suggests a level of certainty in the assessment at the time it was made.

2025-04-15 00:04:44,549 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, we need to analyze its content and determine whether it expresses a certain or uncertain statement regarding the Monetary Authority of Singapore's monetary policy meeting.

The sentence is: "domestic cost pressures, particularly stemming from a tight labour market, are likely to remain the primary source of inflation."

1. **Label Assignment**: The key phrase here is "are likely to remain," which indicates a probability rather than a certainty.

2. **Justification**: The use of "likely" suggests that the statement is making a prediction based on current trends or conditions but does not guarantee the outcome.

Therefore, the classification is as follows:

The sentence is: "however, there is significant uncertainty around the economic, reflecting continuing risks in the external environment."

Here's my analysis:

* The sentence explicitly mentions "significant uncertainty" around the economic situation.
* It also highlights "continuing risks in the external environment," which further indicates a lack of certainty.

Given these observations, I will classify the sentence as "uncertain" because it directly expresses uncertainty and mentions ongoing risks.

My output will be:

The sentence is: "against this backdrop, the singapore economy grew more slowly, by 1.6% in q4 2014 on a quarter-on-quarter, seasonally-adjusted annualised basis, or about half the pace of expansion in q3."

Here's my analysis:

The sentence reports a historical fact about the Singapore economy's growth rate in Q4 2014, providing specific numbers and comparisons to the previous quarter. The language used is factual and does not express doubt or uncertainty about the information being presented.

Therefore, my classification is:

```json
2025-04-15 00:05:35,656 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "we therefore expect the singapore economy to remain subdued in the near term, and to start picking up only in the second half of 2002."

1. The sentence uses the word "expect," which indicates a forecast or prediction rather than a statement of fact. This suggests a degree of uncertainty because expectations can be wrong.

2. The sentence is making a prediction about future economic conditions, which inherently involves uncertainty.

Given these observations, the classification should reflect that the sentence is expressing a view about the future that is not guaranteed.
