A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The upward revision of the inflation forecast suggests a potential tightening of monetary policy, indicating a hawkish stance."
}
```

This sentence implies that the Monetary Authority of Singapore may need to take action to combat inflation, which is a hawkish signal. The forecast upgrade indicates a concern about inflationary pressures, which is consistent with a hawkish monetary policy stance.
2025-04-14 23:49:54,879 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence simply reports a factual development in the currency market without expressing a clear stance on future monetary policy, hence it is neutral."
}
```

The sentence reports on the appreciation of the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) in response to external events (de-pegging of Chinese and Malaysian currencies), without indicating any intention to tighten or loosen monetary policy. This suggests a neutral stance. 

No clear indication of a hawkish (favoring tighter monetary policy) or dovish (favoring looser monetary policy)
2025-04-14 23:49:54,879 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions a significant tightening of the labour market and a rise in domestic inflationary pressures, indicating a need for tighter monetary policy, which is a hawkish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence highlights signs of inflationary pressures and a strong economy, which are typically concerns that a central bank with a hawkish stance would aim to address by tightening monetary policy to prevent overheating.
2025-04-14 23:49:54,879 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual assessment of the growth pace without indicating any inclination towards tightening or loosening monetary policy."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply states a projection about the pace of growth without expressing a clear bias towards inflation (hawkish) or economic stimulus (dovish), nor does it seem unrelated to monetary policy (irrelevant).
2025-04-14 23:49:54,879 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates a shift towards a modest and gradual appreciation, suggesting a tightening of monetary policy, which is a hawkish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the understanding that a hawkish monetary policy stance is associated with a tendency to tighten policy to combat inflation or maintain economic stability, often through interest rate increases or, in this case, allowing the currency to appreciate.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a forecast for core inflation without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance, suggesting a neutral tone."
}
```

The sentence simply provides an updated forecast for core inflation and does not suggest any tightening or loosening of monetary policy, which is why I classified it as "neutral".
2025-04-14 23:49:56,316 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a positive outlook on inflation decreasing, which suggests a more accommodative monetary policy stance, characteristic of a dovish tone."
}
```

The reasoning behind this classification is that the sentence mentions a decline in inflation, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy, and the tone is optimistic about this decline, which is consistent with a dovish stance.
2025-04-14 23:49:56,316 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my response:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence focuses on the expected moderate pace of expansion in domestic-oriented sectors, without mentioning any changes to monetary policy or warnings about inflation, indicating a neutral stance."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "neutral" because it provides a balanced view of the economy, mentioning sustained demand and public infrastructure spending, but does not contain any language that would suggest a tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) of monetary policy. The tone is informative and descriptive, rather than advocating for a specific policy action.
2025-04-14 23:49:56,316 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a loosening of monetary policy stance by lowering the GDP growth forecast, indicating a concern for economic downturn and potential easing of policy."
}
```
2025-04-14 23:49:56,316 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a weakening economy, escalating financial turmoil, and severe deceleration in global economic activity, indicating a likely easing of monetary policy, which is a dovish stance."
}
```

The sentence suggests that the economy is facing significant challenges, which is typically associated with a dovish monetary policy stance, where the central bank is more likely to cut interest rates or implement other expansionary measures to stimulate the economy.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates a cautious but non-committal stance, suggesting that the MAS will monitor developments without signaling a specific policy action, which is characteristic of a neutral monetary policy stance."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence does not suggest that the MAS is leaning towards tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) monetary policy, but rather remaining vigilant and responsive to changes in the external environment. The tone is cautious but not directional, which is consistent with a neutral stance.
2025-04-14 23:49:57,925 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The Monetary Authority of Singapore is taking a hawkish stance by raising the slope of the S$NEER policy band, indicating a move to tighten monetary policy and potentially combat inflation."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that raising the slope of the S$NEER policy band is a sign of a tightening monetary policy, which is a characteristic of a hawkish stance. This suggests that the MAS is taking a more aggressive approach to manage inflation and stabilize the currency, which is consistent with a hawkish monetary policy
2025-04-14 23:49:57,925 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The Monetary Authority of Singapore maintained the rate of appreciation of the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate policy band with no changes, indicating a neutral stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) made no changes to the policy band, its width, or its level, which suggests that the monetary policy stance remains unchanged, hence a neutral classification.
2025-04-14 23:49:57,925 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my response:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence focuses on the positive outlook of domestic-oriented sectors, but does not mention interest rates or any specific monetary policy actions, indicating a neutral stance."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "neutral" because it provides an optimistic view of certain sectors of the economy without mentioning any specific monetary policy actions or changes to interest rates, which suggests a neutral tone.
2025-04-14 23:49:57,925 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions 'downside risks' in the external environment, indicating a cautious tone and potential for easing policy, which is characteristic of a dovish stance."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "dovish" because it highlights potential risks and uncertainties, which suggests that the Monetary Authority of Singapore may be inclined to adopt a more accommodative monetary policy stance to mitigate these risks.

I classified the sentence as "hawkish" because it implies a concern about inflation, which is a characteristic of a hawkish monetary policy stance. A hawkish stance typically emphasizes the need to control inflation, often through tighter monetary policy.

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply reports on the movement of interest rates without providing any information that would suggest a shift in the Monetary Authority of Singapore's monetary policy stance. The increase in interest rates could be seen as a sign of a strengthening economy, but it does not necessarily imply a hawkish or dovish stance.

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence does not mention any monetary policy decisions or stances related to the Monetary Authority of Singapore."
}
```

The sentence appears to discuss fiscal policy measures (changes in water charges and excise duty) and the impact of global oil price fluctuations on the economy, but does not provide any information about the Monetary Authority of Singapore's monetary policy stance. Therefore, it is classified as "irrelevant".
2025-04-14 23:49:59,396 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that the economy is expected to improve, which may lead to a less accommodative monetary policy stance, indicating a hawkish tone."
}
```

My reasoning is that a narrowing negative output gap typically implies a strengthening economy, which could lead to inflationary pressures and a need for the Monetary Authority of Singapore to tighten its monetary policy stance, hence the hawkish classification.
2025-04-14 23:49:59,396 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my response:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides an objective statement about economic activity and industry growth without indicating any intention to tighten or loosen monetary policy."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "neutral" because it simply presents a factual observation about the economy without expressing a bias towards increasing or decreasing interest rates, or otherwise adjusting the monetary policy stance.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides an economic outlook without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance, hence it is neutral."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply states a forecast about the economy's growth pace without suggesting any tightening or loosening of monetary policy, nor does it express a negative view on the economy that would warrant a dovish or hawkish stance.
2025-04-14 23:50:00,947 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The increase in CPI-all items inflation to 1.9% suggests a potential concern about rising prices, which is a hawkish signal."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "hawkish" because the mention of rising inflation (1.9% in July-August from 1.6% in Q2 2013) may indicate a concern about inflationary pressures, which is a characteristic of a hawkish monetary policy stance.
2025-04-14 23:50:00,947 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my response:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence 'overall, major uncertainty remains' does not convey a clear direction for monetary policy, indicating a neutral stance."

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply states that uncertainty remains, without expressing a clear inclination towards tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) monetary policy.

I classified the sentence as "irrelevant" because it does not contain any information related to the Monetary Authority of Singapore's monetary policy meeting or stance. The sentence appears to be discussing the US economy, and therefore has no bearing on the MAS's monetary policy.

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a strong and sustained growth in the manufacturing sector, which could lead to inflationary pressures and thus a hawkish monetary policy stance."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "hawkish" because it indicates a positive outlook on the manufacturing sector, which may lead to concerns about inflation and thus a more hawkish stance from the Monetary Authority of Singapore.
2025-04-14 23:50:02,486 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my response:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a neutral forecast for the manufacturing sector's growth without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "neutral" because it simply provides an economic forecast without expressing a clear opinion or intention that would suggest a hawkish (tightening) or dovish (loosening) monetary policy stance. The sentence does not contain any information that would suggest a change in the monetary policy, hence "irrelevant" is not applicable in this context.
2025-04-14 23:50:02,486 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a supportive policy stance for economic growth, which indicates a accommodative monetary policy, characteristic of a dovish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the language used in the sentence, which emphasizes support for economic growth, indicating a more accommodative policy stance, which is typically associated with a dovish monetary policy stance.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions that inflation is expected to pick up, but does not indicate a significant concern or a drastic change in policy, suggesting a neutral stance."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence provides a factual update on inflation expectations without expressing a strong concern or a clear intention to adjust the monetary policy, which is characteristic of a neutral stance.
2025-04-14 23:50:04,135 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence is cautious and data-dependent, mentioning uncertainty around the pandemic and policy responses, but does not explicitly signal a tightening or loosening of monetary policy."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence does not contain language that would suggest a hawkish (inflation-fighting, potentially rate-hiking) or dovish (stimulative, potentially rate-cutting) stance. Instead, it highlights uncertainty and dependence on various factors, which is consistent with a neutral or wait-and-see approach.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence is revising inflation forecast range and does not explicitly indicate a tightening or loosening of monetary policy, hence it is neutral."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence only mentions a revision of the forecast range for CPI-all items inflation, which does not directly imply a change in the monetary policy stance. The revision of the inflation forecast range to a higher range (0.5-1.5%) might suggest a slightly more hawkish tone, but it is still not explicit and hence I classified it as neutral.

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence reports on GDP contraction and does not provide information about the Monetary Authority of Singapore's monetary policy stance."
}
```

This sentence does not provide any information about the Monetary Authority of Singapore's monetary policy decisions or tone, so it is classified as "irrelevant".

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that external inflationary pressures are likely to persist due to higher oil prices, implying a potential need for tighter monetary policy to combat inflation."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "hawkish" because it highlights sustained external inflationary pressures, which is a concern that typically leads to a more aggressive monetary policy stance to control inflation.

I classified the sentence as "neutral" because it simply reports a forecast without suggesting any tightening or loosening of monetary policy, which is a key aspect of hawkish or dovish stances. The sentence does not convey any information that would suggest a shift in the Monetary Authority of Singapore's monetary policy stance, hence the label "neutral".

The mention of a sharp fall in the s$neer suggests that the Monetary Authority of Singapore may need to take action to stabilize the currency, which

The reasoning is that a strengthening of the Singapore dollar's nominal effective exchange rate (S$NEER) implies an appreciation of the currency, which can be a sign of a tightening monetary policy. This is typically associated with a hawkish stance, as it suggests that the Monetary Authority of Singapore is taking steps to curb inflation or manage economic growth.

{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a loosening of monetary policy by removing the modest and gradual appreciation path of the S$NEER policy band, indicating a dovish stance."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "dovish" because it suggests that the Monetary Authority of Singapore is easing its monetary policy stance by removing the gradual appreciation path of the policy band, which would likely lead to a depreciation of the currency or a slower appreciation. This is a dovish move, as it is expected to stimulate economic growth and inflation.

The sentence is also not irrelevant to monetary policy, as it provides context about the economy, but it does not directly address the policy stance.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides an objective economic outlook without indicating a tightening or loosening of monetary policy, hence it is neutral."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence discusses the economic outlook in a factual manner, mentioning the expected pick-up in growth, easing inflation, and uncertainty surrounding the recovery, without expressing a clear inclination towards tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) monetary policy.

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions an upward revision to the core inflation forecast and rapidly accumulating cost pressures, indicating a concern for inflation and a likely tightening of monetary policy."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence highlights inflationary pressures and the need for a policy response, which is consistent with a hawkish monetary policy stance. A hawkish stance is characterized by a focus on controlling inflation, often through interest rate increases or other policy tightening measures.

  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual update on economic conditions without indicating a tightening or loosening of monetary policy, hence a neutral stance."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply reports on the current state of financial markets and economic conditions without expressing a bias towards increasing or decreasing interest rates, or otherwise adjusting the monetary policy stance. This kind of objective reporting is consistent with a neutral monetary policy stance.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a reduced risk of a sharp global downturn, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "dovish" because it suggests that the risk of a global downturn has decreased, which could lead to a more dovish or accommodative monetary policy stance, potentially involving looser monetary policy to support economic growth.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence highlights downward trends in inflation, excess capacity, and lacklustre consumer sentiments, suggesting a benign inflation environment that is typically associated with a dovish monetary policy stance."
}
```

The sentence describes a decline in inflation rates, excess capacity, and weak consumer sentiments, which are factors that would lead to a dovish monetary policy stance, as it indicates that the economy may require accommodative policies to stimulate growth.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual update on domestic economic indicators without expressing a clear inclination towards tightening or loosening monetary policy."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply reports on projected changes in unit labor costs, nominal wage growth, and productivity without suggesting that these changes would necessitate a change in the monetary policy stance. The tone is informative and objective, without any hawkish (inflation-fighting) or dovish (growth-supporting) bias.

{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence focuses on the economic recovery path and return to potential output in 2022, without mentioning any specific policy actions or changes in interest rates, indicating a neutral stance."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence provides an optimistic outlook on the economy's recovery without indicating any inclination towards tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) monetary policy.

  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The MAS's shift to a zero percent appreciation of the S$NEER policy band in October 2008 indicates a loosening of monetary policy, which is a dovish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the understanding that a dovish monetary policy stance is characterized by a loosening of policy, which is often associated with lower interest rates or, in this case, a reduced appreciation of the currency. The MAS's action suggests a desire to stimulate economic growth, which is consistent with a dovish stance.

The reasoning behind this classification is that the sentence implies a expectation of easing inflationary pressures, which is consistent with a dovish monetary policy stance. The mention of inflation "moderating" and "step[ping] down" suggests that the MAS is expecting a decrease in inflation, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy. 

However, an alternative and arguably better classification is:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a specific inflation forecast without indicating a need for policy tightening or loosening, suggesting a neutral stance."
}
```

The sentence provides an inflation forecast without expressing concerns that would typically lead to a hawkish (tightening) or dovish (loosening) stance, hence it's classified as neutral.

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a tightening labor market with wage and rental increases and a low unemployment rate, which could lead to inflationary pressures and a hawkish monetary policy stance."
}
```

My reasoning is that a hawkish monetary policy stance is one that is vigilant about inflation and may consider raising interest rates to curb it. The sentence's description of a strong labor market with wage and rental increases and a low unemployment rate implies that inflationary pressures may be building, which is consistent with a hawkish stance.

{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual update on inflation rates without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance, hence it is neutral."
}
```

This sentence simply reports on the CPI-all items inflation rate without expressing any views on future policy actions or the economy that would suggest a hawkish (concerned about inflation and potentially raising interest rates), dovish (concerned about growth and potentially lowering interest rates), or irrelevant (not related to monetary policy) tone. Therefore, it is classified as neutral.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions new uncertainties for the Singapore economy but does not indicate a clear direction for monetary policy, suggesting a neutral stance."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply states that there are new uncertainties, without expressing a clear inclination towards tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) monetary policy. The sentence is more of a factual observation, which aligns with a neutral stance.
