A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

2025-04-15 00:01:19,030 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides factual information about the trade-weighted S$NEER and the US economy, without expressing a clear stance on monetary policy."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply reports on the trend of the trade-weighted S$NEER and its relationship with the US economy, without indicating a hawkish (tightening) or dovish (loosening) stance on monetary policy.
2025-04-15 00:01:19,030 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a balanced approach, aiming to control inflation while supporting economic activity, indicating a neutral monetary policy stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence mentions two goals: capping inflationary pressures (which is a hawkish goal) and being supportive of economic activity (which is a dovish goal). The fact that it aims to balance both goals suggests a neutral stance.
2025-04-15 00:01:19,030 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my response:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a weakening growth outlook, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "dovish" because it implies a negative economic outlook, which is often associated with a more accommodative or easing monetary policy stance. This type of language tends to be used when policymakers are concerned about economic growth and may be inclined to cut interest rates or implement other stimulative measures, which is a dovish stance.
2025-04-15 00:01:19,030 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides an objective economic outlook without indicating a tightening or loosening of monetary policy, hence it is neutral."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence discusses the economic outlook in a factual manner, mentioning the expected pick-up in growth, easing of inflation, and uncertainty surrounding the recovery, without expressing a clear inclination towards tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) monetary policy.
2025-04-15 00:01:19,030 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my response:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides economic data but does not convey any information about the Monetary Authority of Singapore's monetary policy stance or intentions."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "neutral" because it simply reports on the Singapore economy's growth without mentioning any changes to interest rates, monetary policy, or the MAS's outlook, which are typically indicators of a hawkish, dovish, or dovish-to-hawkish shift. The sentence's tone is informative and factual, without any implication of future policy actions. Therefore, it does not suggest a tightening

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The appreciation of the S$NEER towards the upper bound of the policy band suggests a tightening of monetary policy, which is a hawkish stance."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "hawkish" because the appreciation of the S$NEER towards the upper bound of the policy band implies that the Monetary Authority of Singapore is allowing the currency to strengthen, which can be seen as a sign of a tightening monetary policy stance. This is consistent with a hawkish stance, which is associated with a more restrictive monetary policy.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that domestic cost pressures have decreased, implying a reduced need for tight monetary policy, which is a dovish stance."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "dovish" because it indicates that cost pressures have eased, which could support a more accommodative monetary policy stance. This implies that the Monetary Authority of Singapore may be more likely to loosen policy or keep it easy, rather than tightening it, which is in line with a dovish stance.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides an objective assessment of the economy's growth momentum and its expected trend, without indicating any inclination towards tightening or loosening monetary policy."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply reports on the state of the economy and its expected growth trend without expressing any bias towards a more restrictive (hawkish) or more accommodative (dovish) monetary policy stance.
2025-04-15 00:01:20,748 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual forecast of inflation rates without indicating any intention to tighten or loosen monetary policy, hence it is neutral."
}
```

This sentence does not indicate a hawkish (concerned about inflation and potentially raising interest rates) or dovish (concerned about growth and potentially lowering interest rates) stance, but rather presents a neutral, factual projection of future inflation rates. Therefore, it is classified as neutral.
2025-04-15 00:01:20,748 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my response:

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence does not mention any monetary policy decisions, inflation, or economic growth in a way that suggests a stance on monetary policy."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "irrelevant" because it discusses the performance of a specific sector (modern services) and industry (information & communications) without referencing any monetary policy actions or implications, making it unrelated to the Monetary Authority of Singapore's monetary policy meeting.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual statement about GDP growth without indicating any change in interest rates or policy bias."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "neutral" because it simply provides an economic forecast without suggesting any specific action or bias towards tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) monetary policy.
2025-04-15 00:01:22,288 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates that MAS decided to tighten further to lean against persistent price pressures, suggesting a stance focused on controlling inflation."
}
```

This classification is based on the language used in the sentence, which implies a concern about inflation (price pressures becoming more persistent) and a decision to take action to mitigate it (tighten further). This is consistent with a hawkish monetary policy stance, which prioritizes controlling inflation over stimulating economic growth.
2025-04-15 00:01:22,288 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my response:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides information on Singapore's GDP growth without mentioning any changes to interest rates or monetary policy, indicating a neutral stance."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "neutral" because it simply reports on the state of the economy (GDP growth) without providing any indication of a shift in monetary policy or expressing a hawkish (concerned about inflation) or dovish (concerned about growth) tone.
2025-04-15 00:01:22,288 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{

I classified the sentence as "hawkish" because it highlights a concern about inflationary pressures, which is a characteristic of a hawkish monetary policy stance. A hawkish stance typically emphasizes the need to control inflation, often through tighter monetary policy, to ensure price stability.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides an objective description of economic conditions without indicating a tightening or loosening of monetary policy, hence it is neutral."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply reports on the positive performance of certain industries and does not suggest any inclination towards increasing (hawkish) or decreasing (dovish) interest rates, nor does it seem unrelated (irrelevant) to monetary policy discussions.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a stable or slightly increasing interest rate environment, without indicating a significant shift in the monetary policy stance, hence a neutral classification."
}
```

The sentence simply reports on the current state of interest rates, without suggesting a change in the Monetary Authority of Singapore's monetary policy stance. The rates mentioned are either unchanged or slightly up, which does not strongly suggest a hawkish (tightening) or dovish (loosening) stance. Therefore, the classification is neutral.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates a downward revision of the inflation forecast, suggesting a more accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

The reasoning behind this classification is that a dovish stance is typically associated with a more accommodative monetary policy, which is implied by the downward revision of the inflation forecast. The reduction in the inflation forecast range from 3-4% to 2.5-3.5% suggests that the Monetary Authority of Singapore may be more likely to maintain or ease monetary policy, which is a dovish stance.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a decrease in CPI inflation, implying a potentially accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

The reasoning behind this classification is that the sentence implies a positive outlook on inflation trending down, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy, characteristic of a dovish stance.
2025-04-15 00:01:25,466 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that a global economic downturn would lead to lower domestic inflation, implying a potential easing of monetary policy, which is a dovish stance."
}
```

This sentence implies that the Monetary Authority of Singapore might loosen its monetary policy in response to a significant downturn in the global economy, which is characteristic of a dovish stance.
2025-04-15 00:01:25,466 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance and provide a justification, let's analyze the given sentence:

"For the full year, it is expected to come in at around 5% in 2011 and 2.5-3.5% in 2012."

This sentence appears to be providing economic growth forecasts for the years 2011 and 2012 without directly mentioning any intentions to tighten, loosen, or maintain the current monetary policy. 

Given that, the sentence seems to lack a direct implication on the monetary policy stance, which involves actions like changing interest rates or adjusting reserve requirements to influence the economy.

Therefore, the classification would

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides factual information about industrial production data without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance, hence it is neutral."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "neutral" because it simply presents data on industrial production without suggesting any implications for monetary policy, such as a need for tightening (hawkish) or easing (dovish). The sentence is informative but does not lean towards any specific policy action, and therefore, it does not directly relate to a hawkish, dovish, or explicitly irrelevant stance regarding policy changes.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual update on the S$NEER's movement within the policy band without indicating any intention to tighten or loosen monetary policy."
}
```

The sentence simply reports on the movement of the S$NEER within the policy band without expressing any bias towards tightening or loosening monetary policy, hence a neutral stance.

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a stronger growth momentum, which could lead to inflationary pressures and thus a hawkish stance from the Monetary Authority of Singapore."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "hawkish" because a stronger-than-expected growth momentum, particularly in the electronics industry, may indicate a need for the Monetary Authority of Singapore to tighten monetary policy to prevent overheating and inflation, which is a hawkish stance.
2025-04-15 00:01:33,708 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a continued commitment to a modest and gradual appreciation of the S$NEER policy band, indicating a bias towards tightening or a relatively strong currency, which is a hawkish stance."
}

However, upon re-reading, I think a more accurate classification would be:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates that the MAS will maintain the current policy, which suggests no change in the monetary policy stance, making it neutral."

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates that a neutral policy stance is deemed appropriate for an extended period, suggesting a neutral monetary policy stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the sentence's indication that a neutral policy stance is suitable for an extended period, which directly implies a neutral stance without hinting at tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) monetary policy.
2025-04-15 00:01:35,205 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my response:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a projection of Singapore's GDP growth rate without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance, making it a neutral statement."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply provides an economic forecast without suggesting any tightening or loosening of monetary policy, which is a key aspect of hawkish or dovish stances. The sentence does not convey any information that would suggest a shift in the Monetary Authority of Singapore's monetary policy stance, hence it is classified as neutral.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence does not mention any specific monetary policy actions or changes in interest rates, and instead focuses on the economy's sectors and government spending, indicating a neutral stance."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "neutral" because it does not contain any language that suggests a tightening or loosening of monetary policy, and instead provides a general overview of the economy. There is no indication of a "hawkish" (concerned with inflation and potentially raising interest rates) or "dovish" (focused on economic growth and potentially lowering interest

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence does not mention any monetary policy decisions or stances of the Monetary Authority of Singapore."
}
```

The sentence appears to discuss a factor affecting meat prices, which is unrelated to monetary policy decisions. Therefore, I classified it as "irrelevant".

I chose "neutral" because the sentence describes financial conditions as "mostly favourable" and inflation as "well-contained", implying that there is no need for immediate action or drastic changes in monetary policy, which is consistent with a neutral stance.

  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual description of the s$neer's fluctuation within the policy band without indicating any intention to tighten or loosen monetary policy, suggesting a neutral stance."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply reports on the s$neer's movement within the policy band without expressing any bias towards strengthening or weakening the currency, which is consistent with a neutral monetary policy stance.

{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions a significant slowdown in CPI inflation, which suggests a less hawkish tone and potentially supports a more accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

The reasoning behind this classification is that a dovish monetary policy stance is characterized by a focus on economic growth and employment, and a willingness to keep interest rates low or implement expansionary policies. The sentence's mention of a significant decrease in inflation, from 5.4% to 2.4%, implies that the economy may be experiencing a slowdown, which could

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The Monetary Authority of Singapore increased the slope of the S$NEER policy band, indicating a slightly tighter monetary policy stance to combat potential inflationary pressures."
}
```

This classification is based on the understanding that a hawkish monetary policy stance is one that is more inclined to raise interest rates or tighten policy to control inflation, and increasing the slope of the policy band suggests a slightly more aggressive approach to managing inflation.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual projection of inflation without indicating any intention to tighten or loosen monetary policy, hence it is neutral."
}
```

The sentence simply states a projection of inflation without expressing any concern or intention to adjust the monetary policy stance, which suggests a neutral tone. There is no indication of a hawkish (concerned about inflation and potentially raising interest rates) or dovish (concerned about growth and potentially lowering interest rates) stance. Therefore, the label "neutral" is assigned.

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a tightening of monetary policy through the appreciation of the S$NEER and rise in domestic interest rates, indicating a hawkish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence mentions a "significant tightening in domestic liquidity conditions", which suggests that the Monetary Authority of Singapore is taking steps to reduce inflationary pressures or curb economic growth, a characteristic of a hawkish monetary policy stance.

  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence focuses on specific sectors that will benefit from steady domestic demand and investments, without indicating a tightening or loosening of monetary policy, hence a neutral stance."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence provides an objective analysis of the economy without suggesting that the Monetary Authority of Singapore will change its monetary policy stance. There is no indication of a hawkish (tightening) or dovish (loosening) tone, which is why I did not choose those labels. The sentence is also relevant to the economy and monetary policy,

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that the current policy stance is appropriate given the expected steady economic expansion and rising inflation, indicating no inclination to change the stance aggressively."
}

{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The policy maintains the current level of the policy band with no changes, indicating a neutral stance."

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence does not mention any monetary policy actions, economic indicators, or inflation concerns, and therefore does not relate to the Monetary Authority of Singapore's monetary policy stance."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "irrelevant" because it discusses the global IT industry's growth and its potential impact on specific Singaporean industries, but does not provide any information about monetary policy or the economy that would suggest a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance.

The sentence simply provides an inflation forecast without suggesting any specific action or change in the monetary policy stance, which is characteristic of a neutral statement. There is no indication of a hawkish (tightening) or dovish (loosening) stance.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that imported price pressures have been muted, implying that there may be less need for aggressive monetary policy tightening, which is a dovish stance."

The sentence implies a relatively calm view on inflation, which aligns with a dovish monetary policy stance, which tends to prioritize economic growth and employment over inflation concerns.

{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions a softening of global final demand due to elevated interest rates, but does not explicitly indicate a change in the Monetary Authority of Singapore's monetary policy stance."

I chose "neutral" because the sentence provides a factual observation about the global economic outlook without expressing a clear opinion or intention regarding the Monetary Authority of Singapore's future policy actions.

}
```

My reasoning is that a strengthening external environment is likely to lead to increased economic growth, which may require the Monetary Authority of Singapore to adopt a more hawkish monetary policy stance to prevent overheating. 

However, I can also see that some might interpret it as neutral since it simply states a fact about the economy without explicitly mentioning monetary policy. 

An alternative classification could be:

```

This sentence implies a dovish stance because it highlights the possibility of disinflationary pressures, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy to stimulate the economy.

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The strengthening of the S$NEER suggests a tightening of monetary policy, which is a hawkish stance."
}
```

In this classification, I labeled the sentence as "hawkish" because a stronger S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) implies a more appreciative currency, which can be a sign of a tighter monetary policy, typically associated with hawkish central bank actions.
2025-04-15 00:01:53,469 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my response:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a downward revision in forecasts due to weak economic indicators, implying a potentially accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "dovish" because it implies that the economic outlook is deteriorating, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance, typically associated with dovish central banks.
2025-04-15 00:01:53,469 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies that inflationary pressures are building, which could lead to a tightening of monetary policy, a hawkish stance."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "hawkish" because it highlights the potential for increased domestic inflation due to rising energy and agricultural commodity prices, which could lead to a more aggressive monetary policy stance to combat inflation.
2025-04-15 00:01:53,469 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that inflationary pressures from external sources are expected to be low, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

The sentence is classified as "dovish" because it implies that the Monetary Authority of Singapore may not need to tighten monetary policy aggressively, given the benign external inflationary environment. This tone is consistent with a dovish stance, which emphasizes economic growth and low inflation over concerns about inflationary pressures.
2025-04-15 00:01:53,469 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The MAS is maintaining its existing policy of allowing a gradual, modest appreciation of the trade-weighted Singapore dollar, indicating no change in its stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence mentions that the MAS has not changed its policy, which suggests a neutral stance. The policy itself allows for a gradual appreciation of the currency, which is not aggressively tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) monetary policy. Therefore, the label "neutral" is assigned.

Given that the sentence mentions a rise in a percentage (likely referring to an interest rate or a similar economic indicator), this action typically suggests that the Monetary Authority of Singapore is tightening its monetary policy to combat inflation or to manage economic growth. Such a move is usually associated with a hawkish stance, as it indicates concern over inflation or economic overheating.

Therefore, the classification would be:

My reasoning is that the sentence highlights the negative impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on economic activities, which is a typical precursor to a dovish monetary policy stance, where the central bank is more likely to cut interest rates or implement other expansionary measures to support the economy.

I chose "neutral" because the sentence highlights uncertainty and risks without expressing a clear direction for monetary policy, which is consistent with a neutral stance. The sentence does not contain language that would suggest a hawkish (concerned about inflation and potentially raising interest rates) or dovish (concerned about growth and potentially lowering interest rates) tone.

I classified the sentence as "dovish" because it implies a cautious and potentially supportive monetary policy stance, given the expectation of a sluggish economy in the near term. This tone is consistent with a dovish stance, which tends to prioritize economic growth and stability over inflation concerns.

```
{

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions downward pressure on the S$NEER, suggesting a concern for economic growth and potentially easing monetary policy, which is a dovish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the context that a dovish monetary policy stance is associated with concerns about economic growth and potentially easing policy to address downside risks, which aligns with the mention of downward pressure on the S$NEER due to geopolitical events and China's growth slowdown.

{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a relaxation of monetary policy as the S$NEER has depreciated to a level slightly below the mid-point of the policy band, indicating a more accommodative stance."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "dovish" because the depreciation of the S$NEER to a level slightly below the mid-point of the policy band suggests that the Monetary Authority of Singapore is adopting a more accommodative monetary policy stance, which is characteristic of a dovish stance.

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The appreciation of the S$NEER to the upper half of the policy band suggests a tightening of monetary policy, which is a hawkish stance."
}
```

Explanation: A hawkish monetary policy stance is characterized by a tendency to increase interest rates or reduce inflation, and the appreciation of the currency (S$NEER) to the upper half of the policy band implies that the Monetary Authority of Singapore is allowing or promoting a stronger currency, which can help reduce inflationary pressures.

I classified the sentence as "irrelevant" because it does not contain any information related to the Monetary Authority of Singapore's monetary policy meeting or stance. The sentence appears to be discussing the US economy, and therefore has no bearing on the Monetary Authority of Singapore's policy decisions.

  "justification": "The sentence suggests easing inflationary pressures, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance."
