A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific economic growth rate based on advance estimates, indicating a factual and confirmed piece of information."
}
```

This classification is based on the language used in the sentence, which presents a clear and specific economic growth rate (1.0% on a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis) attributed to a credible source (MTI's advance estimates). The tone is factual and descriptive, indicating that the information is presented as a confirmed fact rather than a speculative or uncertain one.
2025-04-14 23:56:22,864 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my response:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words with uncertain implications, such as 'should' and 'compared to last year', which suggest a prediction rather than a definitive statement."
}
```

Although the sentence has a somewhat positive tone, the use of "should" implies a degree of uncertainty or prediction, rather than a statement of fact. This leads me to classify the sentence as uncertain.
2025-04-14 23:56:22,864 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence states that MAS 'has assessed' and found it 'appropriate to adjust the prevailing stance', indicating a definitive decision or action."
}
```
2025-04-14 23:56:22,864 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
2025-04-14 23:56:22,864 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'likely' that indicate a degree of uncertainty rather than a definitive statement."
}
```

This sentence is classified as uncertain because it uses the word "likely", which suggests a probability rather than a certainty.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a past event using specific data and trends, indicating a factual and certain statement."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it uses specific phrases such as "has depreciated", "declining inflation", and "sharply weakening economic growth", which suggest a factual and objective description of a past event, rather than a speculative or uncertain one.
2025-04-14 23:56:27,626 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'expected', 'easing further', and 'towards the end of the year', which indicate uncertainty and prediction rather than certainty."
}
```

This sentence is classified as uncertain because it expresses a prediction or expectation about future events (e.g., inflation rates, oil prices) rather than stating a fact. The use of words like "expected", "easing further", and "towards the end of the year" also suggests a degree of uncertainty and ambiguity.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains the word 'likely', which indicates a degree of uncertainty or probability rather than a definitive statement."
}
```

This classification is based on the presence of the word "likely", which suggests that the outcome is probable but not guaranteed, hence indicating uncertainty.

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because, despite the sentence providing a general outlook on inflationary pressures, it uses language that suggests a level of prediction or expectation rather than stating facts with absolute certainty.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains conditional phrases and words like 'should' that indicate a prediction or expectation rather than a certainty."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it expresses a prediction or expectation about future economic activity, rather than stating a fact or guaranteeing a specific outcome. The use of the word "should" and the conditional phrases "as existing vaccines have been effective" and "as inoculation rates rise globally" suggest that the outcome is not guaranteed, but rather dependent on certain conditions being met.

This sentence is classified as uncertain because it uses the word "expected", which implies a forecast or prediction rather than a definitive statement.
2025-04-14 23:56:32,550 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a confident prediction about the future effect of car prices and imputed rentals on inflationary pressures, using the phrase 'will continue to dampen'."
}
```

However, I can also argue that it is uncertain because it contains the phrase "amid the expected increase", which may not necessarily happen. Here is an alternative classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains the phrase 'expected increase', which implies some degree of uncertainty about the future supply of coes and housing

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a historical fact about the Singapore economy's rebound in H2 2003, which can be verified and is stated as a fact."

```

This sentence is classified as "certain" because it describes a past event that has a clear outcome, and the language used is factual and assertive, without any expressions of doubt or uncertainty.

This sentence is classified as uncertain because it expresses a conditional expectation that depends on specific events not occurring, implying that there are potential risks and uncertainties that could affect the outcome.

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it expresses a prediction or expectation about future events, rather than stating a fact. The use of words like "should", "anticipated", and "further normalises" implies a degree of uncertainty or unpredictability, which is characteristic of uncertain language.

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it expresses a prediction or expectation about future economic activity, rather than stating a current fact. The use of words like "expected" and "fairly resilient" suggests a degree of uncertainty or ambiguity, which is characteristic of uncertain statements.
