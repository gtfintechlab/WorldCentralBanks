A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

  "justification": "The sentence contains future-oriented language, such as 'is likely to moderate further' and 'should limit', indicating a projection or prediction about future events."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "forward looking" because it uses phrases that imply a prediction or projection about future events, specifically the moderation of nominal earnings growth and the limitation of demand-induced price increases.

{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses future inflation projections based on current trends, but the language used suggests a prediction of future values based on current data rather than a statement about future policy actions or guidance."
}
```

However, I can see how one might argue it's forward looking. A case can be made that it is forward looking as it does discuss future projections. In that case:

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses projected future inflation rates, indicating a forward-looking statement about expected economic conditions."
2025-04-14 23:52:06,490 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence contains projections of future inflation rates for 2017, indicating a forward-looking perspective."
}
```

This classification is based on the presence of phrases such as "expected to come in at 0.5–1.5% in 2017", which clearly indicate that the sentence is discussing future events or projections, making it forward looking.
2025-04-14 23:52:06,490 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my response:

```
