A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence provided is: "mtiâ€™s advance estimates show that the singapore economy expanded by 1.0% on a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis in q3 2023, up from 0.1% in q2."

1. **Understanding the Content**: The sentence reports on the Singapore economy's growth rate in Q3 2023, indicating a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted increase of 1.0%, which is higher than the

The sentence is: "on the domestic front, the improving labour market should underpin a faster pace of wage growth in 2018 and 2019 compared to last year."

1. **Understanding the sentence**: The sentence discusses the domestic economic situation, specifically mentioning an improving labour market and its expected positive impact on wage growth in the coming years (2018 and 2019).

2. **Analyzing the implications**: An improving labour market and faster wage growth can be indicators of a strengthening economy. Strong wage growth can lead to higher consumption and potentially
2025-04-14 23:58:15,615 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance of the given sentence, let's analyze it step by step.

1. **Understanding the sentence**: The sentence mentions that as part of its ongoing economic surveillance, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has assessed that it is appropriate to adjust the prevailing stance. 

2. **Identifying key elements**: The key elements here are "MAS has assessed" and "adjust the prevailing stance." The adjustment of the stance implies a change in the monetary policy.

3. **Determining the direction of the adjustment**: The sentence does not explicitly state whether the adjustment is towards tightening (hawkish) or easing (dovish).
2025-04-14 23:58:15,615 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, "mas is also restoring a narrower policy band," we need to understand the implications of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) actions on monetary policy.

Restoring a narrower policy band by MAS implies a reduction in the slope of the Singapore dollar's nominal effective exchange rate (S$NEER) policy band, which can be interpreted as a tightening or less easing of monetary policy since it suggests a move towards reducing the pace of depreciation or potentially appreciating the currency. This action is generally associated with a more hawkish stance as it indicates a move to potentially curb inflation or support the currency, reflecting a more

The sentence is: "at the same time, inflationary pressures are likely to pick up, driven by rising global commodity prices as well as some domestic cost factors."

1. **Understanding the sentence**: The sentence indicates an expectation of increasing inflation due to rising global commodity prices and domestic cost factors.

2. **Monetary Policy Stance Classification**:
   - **Hawkish**: A hawkish stance is associated with a concern about inflation and potentially tightening monetary policy to combat it.
   - **Dovish**:

The sentence mentions that "the S$NEER appreciated from the lower half to the upper half of the policy band" over the past six months.
