A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence contains future-oriented language and predictions about economic trends in 2024, indicating a forward-looking statement."
}
```

This classification is based on the presence of phrases such as "later in 2024", "should gradually pick up", and "the timing and extent of the recovery is subject to significant uncertainty", which suggest that the sentence is discussing future events and projections.
2025-04-15 00:02:55,298 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence reports on past economic data and does not contain any projections or statements about future economic conditions or policy actions."
}
```

This sentence is not forward looking because it only discusses historical data, specifically the advance estimates of Singapore's economic expansion in Q3 2021, without making any statements about future economic prospects or policy decisions.

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence reports historical data and does not express a prediction or projection about future economic conditions or policy actions."
