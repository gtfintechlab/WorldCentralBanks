A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "s$ nominal effective exchange rate (s$neer) the s$neer has appreciated towards the upper bound of the policy band over the last six months, reflecting positive risk sentiment arising from policy responses in the us and europe."

First, we need to understand what "forward looking" means in this context. A "forward looking" statement typically refers to information or discussions that imply or directly relate to future events, expectations, or outlooks.
