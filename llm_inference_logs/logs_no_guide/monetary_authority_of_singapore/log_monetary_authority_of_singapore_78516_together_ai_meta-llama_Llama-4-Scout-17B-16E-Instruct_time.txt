A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```

```

I chose "not forward looking" because the sentence only reports on past trends and does not contain any language that suggests a focus on future economic prospects or policy guidance.

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a past situation without making any predictions or projections about future events."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "not forward looking" because it simply states a fact about a past decline in the manufacturing sector and its cause, without expressing any expectation or projection about future developments.

  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses prospects for the future state of Singapore's manufacturing sector and trade-related services."

I classified the sentence as "forward looking" because it uses the word "prospects", which implies a discussion of future possibilities or outlook, indicating that the sentence is looking ahead rather than commenting on current or past events.
