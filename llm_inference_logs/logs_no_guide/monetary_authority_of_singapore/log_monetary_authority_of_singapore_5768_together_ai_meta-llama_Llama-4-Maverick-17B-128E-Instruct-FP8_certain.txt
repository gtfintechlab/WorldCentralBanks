A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "in all, the pace of growth will be slightly below potential this year, following two years when it was above trend."

This sentence is making a statement about a future condition (the pace of growth) relative to its potential. The key phrase here is "will be," which indicates a prediction or forecast rather than a fact. However, the tone and language used are assertive and indicative of a considered judgment rather than speculation.

Let's break down the task as per the instructions:

The sentence is: "further, we will shift the policy band from that of a zero percent appreciation to one of modest and gradual appreciation."

This sentence is making a definitive statement about a future action that will be taken regarding the policy band. The use of "we will" indicates a clear intention or decision that has been made.

The sentence is: "for 2018, core inflation should come in within the upper half of the 1–2% forecast range."

Let's break it down:

1. **Label Assignment**: The key word here is "should," which is often used to express a degree of expectation or prediction rather than a definitive statement of fact.

2. **Justification**: The use of "should" indicates a level of uncertainty or prediction rather than a statement of fact

The sentence is: "mas core inflation has stepped down but is anticipated to decline further to around 2% by the end of 2024."

1. **Label Assignment**: The key phrase here is "is anticipated to decline," which indicates a prediction or expectation rather than a statement of fact. This suggests that the outcome is not certain but rather based on current trends or forecasts.

2. **Justification**: The use of "is anticipated" implies a level of uncertainty as it refers to a future event that has not yet occurred.

The sentence is: "against this backdrop and in view of the sharp fall in domestic economic output over the past two quarters, singapore’s gdp growth forecast for 2009 has been lowered to between -9% and -6%."

First, we observe that the sentence discusses a specific action taken regarding Singapore's GDP growth forecast for 2009. The phrase "has been lowered" indicates a definitive action that has been taken, suggesting a level of certainty.

However, the forecast itself is given as a range ("between -9% and -6%"), which

The sentence is: "for 2008 and 2009 the singapore economy has weakened over the course of 2008, alongside an escalation in the turmoil in financial markets and a more severe deceleration in global economic activity."

First, we observe that the sentence discusses past events and conditions ("has weakened," "escalation," "deceleration"), which are being reported as facts that have occurred.

Let's assign a label and provide a justification based on this analysis.

The sentence is: "mas will remain vigilant to developments in the external environment and their impact on the singapore economy."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence implies a future action or state ("will remain vigilant") that is conditioned on potential developments or changes in the external environment. The use of "will remain vigilant" indicates a commitment or intention rather than a prediction or a statement of fact about a certain outcome. The phrase "developments in the external environment" introduces an element of uncertainty because it refers to future events that are not entirely predictable.

2025-04-14 23:53:28,885 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze it step by step.

The sentence is: "mas will therefore raise slightly the slope of the s$neer policy band, from zero percent previously."

1. **Understanding the sentence**: The sentence is stating a specific action that the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) will take regarding the slope of the S$NEER (Singapore Dollar Nominal Effective Exchange Rate) policy band.

2. **Identifying certainty or uncertainty**: The key to determining if the statement is certain or uncertain lies in the language used. The sentence uses the phrase "will therefore raise," which indicates a definitive future action.

2025-04-14 23:53:28,885 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "in comparison, the domestic-oriented sectors should continue to provide some support to the economy, underpinned by sustained demand for healthcare and education services, as well as public infrastructure spending."

1. The sentence uses the word "should," which indicates a degree of expectation or prediction rather than a statement of fact. However, it is not overly speculative.
2. The phrase "underpinned by sustained demand" suggests a basis or reason for the expectation that is grounded in existing conditions or trends.

Given these observations, the sentence leans towards being more certain than uncertain
2025-04-14 23:53:28,885 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and implications.

The sentence is: "cpi inflation forecast for 2002 despite recent tentative signs of a bottoming out, downside risks remain in the external environment."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence contains phrases like "tentative signs" and "downside risks remain," which indicate a level of uncertainty or caution regarding future economic conditions.

2. **Justification**: The presence of "tentative signs" and "downside risks" in the sentence signifies that the outcome or future state is not considered definitive or certain.

Therefore, the classification is as follows:

The sentence is: "in conjunction with a gradual domestic reopening, the singapore economy should also continue on its recovery path and aggregate output should return to potential in 2022."

First, we observe the use of the word "should," which indicates a degree of expectation or prediction rather than a statement of fact. This kind of language is typically associated with uncertainty because it reflects a belief or forecast about future events rather than a certainty.

Given this observation, we can classify the sentence and provide a justification.

Here's the output following the required structure:

2025-04-14 23:53:56,027 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, I will analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "in october 2008, mas shifted its policy stance to a zero percent appreciation of the s$neer policy band."

Here's my analysis:

* The sentence is stating a historical fact about a specific action taken by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) in October 2008.
* It clearly mentions the policy stance and the specific change made to the S$NEER (Singapore dollar Nominal Effective Exchange Rate) policy band.
* The language used is direct and factual, indicating no ambiguity or doubt.

Given these observations, I conclude that

The sentence is: "these cannot be reliably predicted now, as the us economy is at a turning point."

Here's my analysis:

* The phrase "cannot be reliably predicted" directly indicates a lack of certainty or confidence in making predictions.
* The reason provided, "as the US economy is at a turning point," further supports the uncertainty because being at a "turning point" implies that the future direction is not clear.

Given this analysis, I conclude that the sentence should be classified as "uncertain" because it explicitly states that predictions cannot be made reliably due to

Let's break it down:

1. The term "uncertainties" directly implies a lack of clarity or sureness about future outcomes or the state of the economy.

2. The presence of "new uncertainties" suggests that there are emerging factors or events whose impacts are not clearly understood or predictable.

Given these observations, the sentence implies a lack of certainty regarding the future or the current state of the Singapore economy due to recent developments.
