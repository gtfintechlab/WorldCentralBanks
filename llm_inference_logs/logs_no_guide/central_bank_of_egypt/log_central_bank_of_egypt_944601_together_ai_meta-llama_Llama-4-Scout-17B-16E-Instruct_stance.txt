A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

2025-04-14 19:36:13,832 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The Central Bank of Egypt's decision to raise its overnight deposit rate by 25 bps indicates a tightening of monetary policy, which is a hawkish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that a rate hike is typically considered a hawkish move, as it aims to curb inflation and reduce economic growth, indicating a concern for inflation over growth.
2025-04-14 19:36:13,832 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a decrease in inflation, which could lead to a loosening of monetary policy, indicating a dovish stance."
}
```

The sentence mentions a decline in core CPI and a drop in the annual rate, which could be seen as a sign of easing inflationary pressures. This type of language is often associated with a dovish monetary policy stance, which tends to prioritize economic growth and lower interest rates over inflation concerns.
2025-04-14 19:36:13,832 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual assessment of economic activity without indicating a tightening or loosening of monetary policy, hence a neutral stance."
}
```

The sentence simply presents an observation about the economy without suggesting any specific action or bias towards interest rates, inflation, or economic growth that would typically characterize a hawkish (concerned with inflation, potentially raising rates) or dovish (focused on growth, potentially lowering rates) stance. Therefore, it is classified as neutral.
2025-04-14 19:36:13,832 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates that the MPC judges a rate hike is warranted to address inflationary pressures and anchor inflation expectations, suggesting a tightening of monetary policy."
}
```

This classification is based on the language used in the sentence, which suggests that the Central Bank of Egypt is taking a proactive stance to address inflationary pressures, which is a characteristic of a hawkish monetary policy stance.
2025-04-14 19:36:13,832 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions uncertainty surrounding the inflation outlook but does not explicitly indicate a tightening or loosening of monetary policy, hence a neutral stance."
}
```

The sentence does not contain language that suggests a hawkish (concerned about inflation and potentially raising interest rates) or dovish (concerned about economic growth and potentially lowering interest rates) tone. Instead, it highlights uncertainty, which is consistent with a neutral monetary policy stance.

```

In this classification, I chose "dovish" because the sentence implies that the current economic conditions are improving, which might lead to a more accommodative monetary policy. A dovish stance is typically characterized by a focus on economic growth and stability, and the sentence's positive tone regarding inflation suggests that the Central Bank of Egypt might be inclined to maintain or adopt
2025-04-14 19:36:15,523 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates a commitment to achieving price stability through specific inflation targets, suggesting a focus on controlling inflation, which is a hawkish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence mentions specific inflation targets (7% by 2024 Q4 and 5% by 2026 Q4) and a commitment to achieving price stability, which are characteristic of a hawkish monetary policy stance. A hawkish stance prioritizes controlling inflation over other economic goals, such as stimulating growth or employment.

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The Monetary Policy Committee's decision to raise the overnight deposit and lending rates by 50 bps indicates a tightening of monetary policy, which is a hawkish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that raising interest rates is a typical move to combat inflation or curb economic growth, which is a characteristic of a hawkish monetary policy stance.
2025-04-14 19:36:16,880 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that inflationary pressures are muted, which could support a more accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

The sentence implies that the inflation environment is benign, which is a dovish signal. The Central Bank of Egypt may be more likely to maintain or ease its monetary policy in such a scenario, which is why I classified the stance as dovish.
2025-04-14 19:36:16,880 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates that the discount rate was kept unchanged, suggesting no shift in the monetary policy stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that keeping the discount rate unchanged implies that the Central Bank of Egypt is maintaining its current monetary policy stance, which is neither tightening (hawkish) nor loosening (dovish) it. Therefore, the stance is considered neutral.
2025-04-14 19:36:16,880 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides an objective assessment of inflation risks without indicating a tightening or loosening of monetary policy, hence a neutral stance."

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual economic outlook without indicating any change in monetary policy or a clear bias towards tightening or loosening policy."

```

This sentence appears to be a neutral statement about the economic outlook, rather than a statement about monetary policy. It does not suggest that the Central Bank of Egypt is likely to change its policy stance in a hawkish (more restrictive) or dovish (more accommodative) direction. Therefore, I classify it as "neutral".

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a decrease in inflation rates, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance, indicating a dovish tone."

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a continued focus on inflation control through cumulative tightening, indicating a hawkish stance."
}
```

The reasoning behind this classification is that the mention of "cumulative tightening" and the emphasis on its impact on inflation suggest that the Central Bank of Egypt is prioritizing inflation control, which is a characteristic of a hawkish monetary policy stance.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides factual information about the limited spillover effects of international food prices on domestic food prices, without expressing a clear stance on monetary policy."
}
```

This sentence does not express a clear intention to tighten (hawkish) or loosen (dovish) monetary policy, nor does it seem unrelated (irrelevant) to the topic. Instead, it presents a neutral observation about the relationship between international and domestic food prices, which might be a consideration in the monetary policy decision-making process.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a positive outlook on inflation, expecting it to decline, which suggests a dovish stance as it may lead to a more accommodative monetary policy."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that a dovish monetary policy stance is associated with a more accommodative policy, often in response to low inflation or economic growth concerns. The sentence's expectation of declining inflation suggests that the Central Bank of Egypt may maintain or adopt a more accommodative policy, which is in line with a dovish stance.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a deceleration in inflation rates, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

The reasoning behind this classification is that a decrease in inflation rates (as indicated by the annual rate decelerating to 7.88 percent from 8.38 percent) might lead the Central Bank of Egypt to consider easing monetary policy, which is a dovish stance.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides factual information about Egypt's economic growth without expressing a clear stance on monetary policy, hence it is classified as neutral."
}
```

The sentence simply reports on the state of the economy, mentioning sustained increases in real GDP growth, but does not indicate any intention to tighten (hawkish) or loosen (dovish) monetary policy, nor does it seem unrelated (irrelevant) to monetary policy discussions. Therefore, it is best categorized as neutral.

2025-04-14 19:36:37,859 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance of the given sentence and provide a justification, let's analyze the content:

The sentence discusses the growth of broad money, factors contributing to this growth (recovery of net foreign assets, higher loans to the private sector), and a decrease in the contribution of net claims on the government due to higher external and nonbank financing. 

- **Hawkish** refers to a monetary policy stance that is more inclined towards controlling inflation, often through higher interest rates or reducing money supply, which is not directly indicated here.
- **Dovish** refers to a stance that prioritizes economic growth, often through lower interest

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a concern about inflation staying above the target, suggesting a potentially tighter monetary policy stance."
}
```

The reasoning behind this classification is that the mention of inflation concerns and the explicit reference to the MPC's target, implies that the central bank might be inclined to take a more hawkish stance to combat inflation, which is a characteristic of hawkish monetary policy.
2025-04-14 19:36:40,700 - together_inference - INFO - Response: {

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual analysis of inflation drivers without indicating a tightening or loosening of monetary policy, hence it is neutral."
}
```

This sentence appears to be providing information on the current state of inflation in Egypt, without expressing a clear stance on future monetary policy actions. As such, it does not lean towards being hawkish (indicating a likelihood of increasing interest rates), dovish (indicating a likelihood of decreasing interest rates), or irrelevant (not related to monetary policy). Therefore, the most suitable classification is "neutral".
2025-04-14 19:36:40,700 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The Central Bank of Egypt's decision to raise key policy rates by 300 bps to contain inflationary pressures indicates a hawkish stance focused on combating inflation."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence mentions raising policy rates, which is a typical hawkish monetary policy action aimed at reducing inflationary pressures.
2025-04-14 19:36:40,700 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The monetary policy committee decided to keep interest rates unchanged, indicating no shift in the current monetary policy stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the MPC decided to maintain the current interest rates, which suggests a neutral stance, neither tightening (hawkish) nor loosening (dovish) monetary policy.

{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The monetary policy committee decided to maintain the overnight deposit and lending rates, indicating no change in the current monetary policy stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the MPC decided to keep the interest rates unchanged, which suggests a neutral stance, as there was no tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) of the monetary policy.

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence does not mention any monetary policy decision or stance, making it irrelevant to the classification."

```

The sentence seems to be discussing a specific market or economic event (a transitory supply shock in tomatoes) without referencing any monetary policy actions or tones, which is why I classified it as "irrelevant".

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The increase in inflation rate suggests a potential tightening of monetary policy, which is a hawkish stance."
}
```

Explanation: A hawkish monetary policy stance is associated with concerns about inflation and potential interest rate hikes to combat it. The reported increase in inflation from 5.7% to 6.6% could prompt the Central Bank of Egypt to consider tightening monetary policy, hence the classification as hawkish. 

However, note that the text does not directly mention the central bank's decision or statement, so the classification

  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The increase in core CPI, particularly the rise in the annual rate to 7.47 percent, suggests a tightening bias, indicating a hawkish stance."

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a decline in inflation, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance, indicating a dovish tone."

This classification is based on the fact that a decline in inflation often leads to a more dovish monetary policy stance, as it provides room for interest rates to be cut or kept low to stimulate economic growth. The sentence does not explicitly mention the Central Bank of Egypt's policy actions, but the decrease in inflation rates implies a dovish tone.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The decline in annual core inflation to a record low suggests a more accommodative monetary policy stance, which is characteristic of a dovish stance."

```

The reasoning behind this classification is that a decline in inflation to a record low may suggest that the economy needs less restrictive monetary policy, which is a dovish view. This implies that the Central Bank of Egypt may be more likely to cut interest rates or maintain an accommodative policy stance to support economic growth.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions external factors and their impact on the economy, but does not express a clear stance on monetary policy, indicating a neutral tone."
}
```

I chose "neutral" because the sentence simply describes the context and does not convey a clear direction or bias towards tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) monetary policy.
2025-04-14 19:36:47,265 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The statement focuses on the conditionality of future policy rates on inflation expectations, without signaling a clear intention to tighten or loosen policy."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence does not indicate a clear direction for future policy rates, nor does it emphasize the need for immediate action to raise or lower rates. The focus on inflation expectations suggests a data-dependent approach, which is a neutral stance.
2025-04-14 19:36:47,265 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests that domestic prices are under weak pressure, implying a benign inflation outlook, which is a dovish signal."
}
```

The sentence implies that the economic conditions are not warranting a tightening of monetary policy, which is a dovish stance. The mention of "weak pressures on domestic prices" and "recent recovery" suggests that the Central Bank of Egypt may not need to take aggressive action to combat inflation, which is consistent with a dovish monetary policy stance.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a factual decrease in inflation rate without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance, hence it is neutral."
}
```

This sentence simply reports a data point (a decrease in inflation rate) without suggesting any future action or change in the monetary policy stance, which is why it is classified as "neutral".
2025-04-14 19:36:47,265 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a supportive economic environment, implying a likely accommodative monetary policy stance, which is characteristic of a dovish tone."
}
```

This classification is based on the understanding that:

- "Hawkish" refers to a monetary policy stance that is focused on controlling inflation, often implying higher interest rates or a tightening of policy.
- "Dovish" refers to a stance that prioritizes economic growth and employment, often implying lower interest rates or an easing of policy.
- "Neutral" refers to a balanced or middle

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a decline in inflation rates, which could indicate a more accommodative monetary policy stance, characteristic of a dovish tone."

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates a rate hike, which suggests a tightening of monetary policy, characteristic of a hawkish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that a rate hike (increasing the discount rate) is typically associated with a hawkish monetary policy stance, aimed at curbing inflation or reducing economic growth.
2025-04-14 19:36:49,125 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates that the Central Bank of Egypt is maintaining its current policy rates, which suggests a neutral stance as it aims to achieve a targeted disinflation path without tightening or loosening policy."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence mentions keeping policy rates unchanged, which is a neutral decision. The goal of achieving a targeted disinflation path is a standard objective for central banks, and not tightening or loosening policy suggests that the bank is not taking a strong stance in either direction (hawkish or dovish).

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The central bank's decision to keep its overnight deposit rate unchanged indicates a neutral stance, as it neither tightens nor loosens its monetary policy."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence mentions the central bank keeping its interest rate unchanged, which implies no change in the monetary policy stance. A hawkish stance would involve increasing interest rates to combat inflation, while a dovish stance would involve decreasing interest rates to stimulate economic growth. Since the rate remains the same, the stance is neutral.

```

This sentence appears to be a neutral economic update, discussing sectoral contributions to economic growth, but does not convey any information that would suggest a tightening (hawkish), loosening (dovish), or neutral monetary policy stance. Therefore, it is classified as "irrelevant" to the Central Bank of Egypt's monetary policy meeting.

The sentence provided is: "this decline was supported by favorable base effects and a lower contribution from food prices, while the contribution of nonfood prices remained broadly unchanged."

This sentence appears to discuss factors contributing to a decline in prices, mentioning specific influences such as base effects, food prices, and nonfood prices. There's no direct mention of monetary policy actions or stances (like interest rates), but we can infer the tone from the context:

- **Hawkish** refers to a monetary policy stance that is more inclined towards fighting inflation

2025-04-14 19:36:53,604 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a cautious tone towards potential inflation risks, suggesting that the Central Bank of Egypt may take a stricter monetary policy stance to mitigate these risks."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence highlights the committee's close tracking of inflation risks, which is a typical concern of a hawkish monetary policy stance. A hawkish stance is characterized by a focus on controlling inflation, often through tighter monetary policy, which is consistent with the tone of the sentence.
2025-04-14 19:36:53,604 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions temporary higher inflation rates without expressing concern or intention to take action, indicating a neutral stance."
}
```

The sentence does not express a hawkish tone (concerned about inflation and potentially raising interest rates) or a dovish tone (concerned about growth and potentially lowering interest rates). Instead, it provides a factual description of the expected impact of fiscal consolidation measures on inflation, which suggests a neutral stance.
2025-04-14 19:36:53,604 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence suggests a potential easing of monetary policy to support economic growth, indicating a dovish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the sentence's implication that the Central Bank of Egypt may move towards a less restrictive monetary policy stance to prevent economic growth from falling below its potential, which is a characteristic of a dovish monetary policy stance.
2025-04-14 19:36:53,604 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions disruption to economic activity and financial markets, suggesting a concern for economic stability, which is typically associated with a dovish monetary policy stance."
}
```

The sentence does not explicitly mention interest rates or monetary policy actions, but the context implies a concern for economic stability, which is often a dovish concern. The mention of COVID-19 and containment measures suggests a potentially negative impact on the economy, which would likely lead to a dovish policy response. 

In this case, I did not choose "neutral" because the
2025-04-14 19:36:53,604 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The monetary policy committee decided to maintain the overnight deposit and lending rates, indicating no change in the monetary policy stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the MPC decided to keep the interest rates unchanged, which suggests a neutral stance, as there was no tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) of the monetary policy.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses the potential impact of policy changes on monetary variables without indicating a tightening or loosening of policy, suggesting a neutral stance."

The sentence provides information about the potential effects of phasing out monetary financing of the fiscal deficit and accumulating foreign reserves on broad and reserve money growth, but it does not suggest that the Central Bank of Egypt is leaning towards a more hawkish (tightening) or dovish (loosening) policy. Therefore, the label "neutral" is assigned.
