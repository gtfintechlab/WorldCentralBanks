A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence is describing a past economic phenomenon with a clear cause-and-effect explanation. It does not contain speculative language or express doubt about the facts it presents.

2. **Justification**: The sentence is factual, describing past events and their causes without expressing uncertainty or doubt.

Therefore, the classification is as follows:

The sentence states: "in its meeting held on september 28, 2017, the monetary policy committee (mpc) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the central bank of egypt's (cbe) main operation unchanged at 18.75 percent, 19.75 percent, and 19.25 percent, respectively."

2025-04-14 19:34:44,159 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "against the above background, the expected slowdown in economic growth could largely offset the upside risks on inflation from the rising international food prices."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence contains the word "could," which is a conditional verb indicating possibility rather than certainty. This suggests that the outcome is not definitive.

2. **Justification**: The use of "could largely offset" introduces uncertainty because it indicates a potential outcome rather than a confirmed one.

Therefore, the classification is as follows:

The sentence is: "headline yearonyear inflation rose to 12.30 percent in may 2016 from 10.27 percent in april, recording at 3.05 percent the highest monthly rate since july 2014."

1. **Understanding the task**: We need to determine if the sentence is certain or uncertain regarding the information it presents about the Central Bank of Egypt's context, likely related to inflation rates.

2. **Analyzing the sentence**: The sentence reports specific inflation rates for certain months (May 2016 and April 2016)
2025-04-14 19:34:44,159 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "against this background, the mpc judges that keeping the policy rate unchanged this time is needed to support disinflation."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence implies a decision made by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) based on their judgment. The use of "judges" indicates a level of deliberation and assessment of the current situation ("against this background"). The decision to keep the policy rate unchanged is presented as necessary to support disinflation, which suggests a degree of certainty in their judgment and the action taken.

2. **Justification
