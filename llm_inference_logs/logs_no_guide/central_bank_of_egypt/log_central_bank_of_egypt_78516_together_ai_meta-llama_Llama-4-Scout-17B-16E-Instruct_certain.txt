A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a clear and resolute commitment to a specific policy stance, with no indication of doubt or ambiguity."

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a potential future impact using phrases like 'could weigh' and 'at least in the near term', indicating uncertainty."
}
```

This sentence is classified as uncertain because it uses conditional language ("could weigh") and refers to a potential future impact ("at least in the near term"), which suggests that the outcome is not guaranteed and is therefore uncertain.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'expected' and 'trend', which indicate a degree of uncertainty or prediction rather than a statement of fact."

```

This classification is based on the presence of words that suggest a level of uncertainty or prediction, rather than a definitive statement. The use of "expected" and "trend" implies that the outcome is not guaranteed, but rather a forecast or prediction.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'expected' and 'as the base effect... fully level off', which indicate a degree of uncertainty or prediction rather than a statement of fact."
}
```

This sentence is classified as uncertain because it expresses a prediction or expectation about future events (the continuation of a declining path in annual headline inflation rates) rather than stating a current fact. The use of "expected" and the conditional phrase "as the base effect... fully level off" contribute to the uncertainty.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific decision made by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) with clear and precise details, indicating a certain event."

This sentence is classified as "certain" because it states a specific and factual decision made by the MPC, without any ambiguity or indication of doubt. The use of specific dates, rates, and actions described in detail supports this classification.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates a possibility of changing the decision in the next meeting, implying uncertainty about future actions."
}
```

This classification is based on the phrase "however, with the sentiment to review this decision in its next meeting", which suggests that the decision not to raise interest rates is not set in stone and may be revisited, introducing uncertainty.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports specific, factual data about past economic indicators, such as CPI rates, without any expressions of doubt or future predictions."

{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words and phrases that indicate uncertainty, such as 'remain contingent', 'in light of', and 'emergence of new variants', which suggest a lack of control over future outcomes."
}
```

This classification is based on the presence of words and phrases that indicate uncertainty, ambiguity, or conditionality, which suggest that the outcome is not guaranteed or predictable.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific decision made by the Monetary Policy Committee of the Central Bank of Egypt, indicating a clear and definitive action."

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a judgment about the balance of risks, using phrases like 'the mpc judges' and 'has tilted', which indicate uncertainty and subjective assessment."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it expresses a subjective judgment about the balance of risks, rather than stating a fact with certainty. The use of phrases like "the mpc judges" and "has tilted" suggests that the outcome is not guaranteed, but rather a assessment based on current information.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific fact about the state of leading indicators in 2022 Q2, without expressing any doubt or ambiguity."

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions a 'transitory supply shock' which implies a degree of unpredictability and uncertainty about future events."
}
```

The sentence is classified as "uncertain" because it refers to a specific event (a transitory supply shock) that may or may not happen, and the use of the word "reflected" suggests that the outcome is being described in retrospect, but the nature of the shock itself is still subject to interpretation. 

However, upon re-reading, I think I can make a stronger case:
