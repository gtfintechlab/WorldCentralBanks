A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

2025-04-14 19:37:05,834 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence uses the word 'decided', which indicates a definitive action, suggesting certainty about the Central Bank of Egypt's monetary policy decision."
}
```
2025-04-14 19:37:05,834 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports historical data and statistics, which are verifiable and known facts, indicating certainty."
}
```

This sentence reports specific data and statistics about core CPI and annual rates in July and August, which are objective facts that can be verified, hence the classification as "certain".
2025-04-14 19:37:05,834 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence uses phrases like 'point towards' and 'as the strong positive base effect diminishes', which indicate a degree of uncertainty and conditionality."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it expresses a tendency or a possibility rather than a definitive statement. The use of "point towards" and the conditional phrase "as the strong positive base effect diminishes" suggest that the outcome is not guaranteed, introducing an element of uncertainty.
2025-04-14 19:37:05,834 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains phrases that indicate uncertainty, such as 'downside risks and uncertainty', 'softening growth', and 'balance of risks', which suggest that the outcome is not entirely predictable."
}
```

Although the sentence ultimately concludes that "a rate hike is warranted", the presence of uncertain language throughout the sentence suggests that the outcome is not entirely certain. The justification focuses on the overall tone and specific phrases that indicate uncertainty, leading to the classification as "uncertain".
2025-04-14 19:37:05,834 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses uncertainty about the inflation outlook due to geopolitical tensions and their impact on energy prices."
}
```

This classification is based on the presence of words and phrases that indicate uncertainty, such as "have raised uncertainty", "particularly concerning", and "surrounding". These phrases suggest that the outcome is not clear or predictable, which is a characteristic of uncertain statements.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence presents a factual observation about the trend of nonfood inflation and its implications, without expressing any doubt or ambiguity."

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it states a clear and factual observation about the trend of nonfood inflation and its implications, using phrases such as "has remained largely subdued" and "implying that", which indicate a degree of confidence and certainty.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'expected' and 'will continue hovering', which indicate a degree of uncertainty or prediction rather than a statement of fact."

This classification is based on the presence of words that suggest a level of uncertainty or prediction, rather than a definitive statement. The use of "expected" and "will continue hovering" implies that the outcome is not guaranteed, but rather a forecast or prediction.

This sentence is classified as uncertain because it discusses a hypothetical scenario and its potential impact on the inflation outlook, rather than stating a fact or a definitive outcome.

  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'expected' and 'as the base effect... fully level off', which indicate a degree of uncertainty or prediction rather than a statement of fact."
}
```

This sentence is classified as uncertain because it expresses a prediction or expectation about future events (the annual headline inflation rates continuing on a declining path) rather than stating a current fact. The use of "expected" and the conditional phrase "as the base effect... fully level off" contribute to the uncertainty.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a clear and definitive stance of the MPC regarding the Russo-Ukrainian conflict's impact on monetary policy, indicating a certain classification."
}
```

I chose "certain" because the sentence uses definitive language, such as "treats" and "are outside the scope", which indicates a clear and confident statement. There is no ambiguity or uncertainty expressed in the sentence.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence presents a clear attribution of price increases to specific factors, indicating a certain explanation."
}
```

However, upon re-reading, I realize that the sentence is actually describing a situation where factors "can be partly attributed" to certain effects, which implies a degree of uncertainty.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence states a definitive decision made by the MPC, indicating a certain outcome."
}
```

This classification is based on the use of the word "decided" which implies a firm and certain decision, rather than a speculative or uncertain one.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a definitive future action of the MPC, indicating a planned course of action without any ambiguity or doubt."
}
```

Although the sentence mentions that the level and duration of restriction will be determined "based on its assessment", which might imply some degree of conditionality, the overall tone and language used suggest a commitment to a data-driven approach, making the overall statement more certain than uncertain.
2025-04-14 19:37:45,171 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a clear commitment to a specific policy action, indicating a certain future course of action."
}
```

The sentence is classified as "certain" because it uses the phrase "is committed to", which implies a firm decision or intention, and "continue", which suggests a ongoing and determined process.
2025-04-14 19:37:45,171 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a specific decision made by the MPC and a clear policy stance, indicating a certain tone."
}
```

The sentence uses definitive language, such as "the mpc decided" and "remains consistent", which suggests a certain tone. There is no ambiguity or indication of doubt, which is typically characteristic of uncertain language.
2025-04-14 19:37:45,171 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'likely' and 'going forward', which indicate uncertainty and future prediction rather than a definite statement."
}
```

This classification is based on the presence of words that suggest a degree of uncertainty or speculation about future events, rather than a statement of fact.
