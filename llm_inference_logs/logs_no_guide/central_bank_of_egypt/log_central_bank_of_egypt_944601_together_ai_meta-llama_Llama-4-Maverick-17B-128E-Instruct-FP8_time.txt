A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "the central bank of egypt decided to raise its overnight deposit rate by 25 bps to 8.75 percent per annum."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence reports on a decision that has already been made regarding the overnight deposit rate. It does not explicitly or implicitly suggest future actions or expectations beyond the reported decision.

2. **Justification**: The sentence is describing a past action taken by the Central Bank of Egypt, indicating a decision that has already been implemented rather than hinting at future intentions or expectations.

Therefore, the classification is as
2025-04-14 19:40:39,199 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and context.

The sentence provided is: "in the meantime, core cpi declined by 0.23 percent in august compared to an increase of 0.30 in july, leading the annual rate to drop to 5.61 percent in august from 6.49 percent in july."

1. **Understanding the Sentence**: The sentence discusses the change in the core Consumer Price Index (CPI) in August compared to July, and its impact on the annual rate. It reports historical data regarding inflation rates.

2. **Classification**:
   - **Forward Looking**: A sentence
2025-04-14 19:40:39,199 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and context.

The sentence is: "leading indicators for 2022 q2 point towards normalized economic activity, as the strong positive base effect diminishes."

1. **Understanding the Sentence**: The sentence discusses "leading indicators for 2022 Q2," which implies it is talking about data or signs that precede and potentially predict future economic activity. The phrase "point towards normalized economic activity" suggests an interpretation or expectation of how the economy will behave.

2. **Determining the Label**:
   - **Forward Looking**: A sentence is considered "forward looking" if it contains information or statements that

The sentence is: "however, increasing geopolitical tensions in the region have raised uncertainty surrounding the inflation outlook, particularly concerning energy prices."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence is discussing the impact of current events (increasing geopolitical tensions) on future economic conditions (inflation outlook). This indicates it is making a statement that has implications for the future.

2. **Justification**: The sentence is considered "forward looking" because it mentions the "inflation outlook," which refers to future inflation expectations, thereby indicating a projection or anticipation
