A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

1. **Understanding the Sentence**: The sentence mentions that "elevated global and domestic prices are expected to keep headline inflation above the MPC’s preannounced target of 7 percent (±2 percentage points) on average in 2022 Q4." This indicates a concern about inflation being higher than the target range.

2. **Identifying Key Elements**: The key elements here are "elevated global and domestic prices," "headline inflation," and the fact that it is expected to be "above the MPC’s preannounced
2025-04-14 17:22:24,083 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence according to the Central Bank of Egypt's monetary policy stance, let's analyze its content.

The sentence suggests that as inflation is expected to decrease, there's an increasing possibility of adopting a less restrictive monetary policy to support economic growth. This implies a potential easing of monetary policy.

1. **Label Assignment**: The mention of moving towards a "less restrictive monetary policy" indicates an inclination towards easing monetary conditions, which is characteristic of a dovish stance.

2. **Justification**: The sentence is classified as dovish because it indicates a likelihood of easing monetary policy in the future to support economic growth as inflation declines.

2025-04-14 17:22:24,083 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence according to the Central Bank of Egypt's monetary policy stance, let's analyze it step by step.

1. **Understanding the Sentence**: The sentence discusses the unemployment rate narrowing to 12.0 percent on average during the second half of 2016/17, reaching its lowest rate since 2011/12.

2. **Relevance to Monetary Policy**: Monetary policy decisions are often influenced by employment rates among other macroeconomic indicators. A decrease in the unemployment rate can indicate a strengthening economy.

3. **Classification**:
   - **Hawkish**: A hawkish stance is typically associated with concerns about inflation and
2025-04-14 17:22:24,083 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance based on the given sentence, we need to analyze the decision made by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) and understand the implications of that decision.

The sentence states that the MPC decided to keep the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the CBE's main operation unchanged. This means there was no adjustment to the interest rates.

Let's analyze this information:

1. **Decision Details**: The rates were kept unchanged at 8.25 percent for the overnight deposit rate, 9.25 percent for the overnight lending rate, and 8
2025-04-14 17:22:24,083 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence regarding the Central Bank of Egypt's monetary policy meeting, let's analyze it step by step.

1. **Understanding the Sentence**: The sentence "the MPC will continue to monitor the incoming developments underlying the economic outlook" indicates that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is watching the economic situation closely but does not specify any immediate action regarding interest rates or monetary policy.

2. **Analyzing the Tone and Implication**:
   - **Hawkish**: A hawkish stance would imply a focus on inflation concerns or a tendency towards tightening monetary policy. The sentence does not directly indicate this.
