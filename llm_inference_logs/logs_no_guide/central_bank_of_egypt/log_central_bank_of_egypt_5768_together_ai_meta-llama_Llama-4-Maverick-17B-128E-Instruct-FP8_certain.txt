A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "elevated global and domestic prices are expected to keep headline inflation above the mpc’s preannounced target of 7 percent (±2 percentage points) on average in 2022 q4."

1. **Label Assignment**: The key phrase here is "are expected to," which indicates a prediction or forecast rather than a statement of fact. This suggests that the outcome is not certain but is based on current analysis or trends.

2. **Justification**: The use of "are expected to" in the sentence indicates a forecast, making the statement uncertain
2025-04-14 17:23:20,946 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "nonetheless, as inflation is projected to decline significantly over the coming months, the scope to move towards a less restrictive monetary policy stance in the period ahead is increasing in order to prevent economic growth from falling below its potential."

First, we observe that the sentence discusses a future action (moving towards a less restrictive monetary policy stance) based on a projection (inflation declining). The key phrases to focus on are "is projected to decline" and "the scope... is increasing," which indicate future expectations rather than certainties.

1. **Label Assignment
2025-04-14 17:23:20,946 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, we need to analyze its content and determine whether it expresses a certain or uncertain statement regarding the context of the Central Bank of Egypt's monetary policy meeting.

The sentence provided is: "this coincided with the narrowing of the unemployment rate to 12.0 percent on average during the second half of 2016/17, registering the lowest rate since 2011/12."

Let's break down the task:

1. **Understanding the Sentence**: The sentence reports a specific economic fact - the unemployment rate narrowing to 12.0 percent on average during the second half of 2016/17 and notes it
2025-04-14 17:23:20,946 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, I will analyze its content and tone.

The sentence states: "in its meeting held on april 28, 2014, the monetary policy committee (mpc) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the cbe's main operation unchanged at 8.25 percent, 9.25 percent, and 8.75 percent, respectively."

This sentence reports a specific decision made by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Central Bank of Egypt during a meeting on a particular date. The language used is factual and definitive, indicating a clear action taken by
2025-04-14 17:23:20,946 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and implications.

The sentence is: "the mpc will continue to monitor the incoming developments underlying the economic outlook."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence implies a future action that is dependent on ongoing or future developments, indicating a level of uncertainty or conditionality.

2. **Justification**: The use of "will continue to monitor" and reference to "incoming developments" suggests that the outcome or future decisions are not predetermined, indicating uncertainty.

Given these observations, the classification should be:

Let's break it down:

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence reports on a specific event or observation ("a number of leading indicators started showing signs of recovery") that occurred at a particular time ("in June and July 2020").
2025-04-14 17:23:56,836 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, "globally, the expansion of economic activity weakened," we need to assess whether it conveys a sense of certainty or uncertainty regarding the statement it makes about the global economic activity.

The sentence is a statement about a past event or trend ("the expansion of economic activity weakened"), and it does so in a direct manner without expressing doubt or ambiguity about the occurrence of this weakening.

Therefore, the classification should be based on the assertive nature of the statement.

The sentence discusses expectations regarding real GDP growth and its future trajectory, influenced by factors such as regional instability and maritime trade disruptions. The key phrases to focus on are "is expected to soften" and "in light of actual developments and the negative spill overs," which indicate a level of forecasting and conditionality based on certain factors.

Given that the sentence involves expectations and is influenced by various factors that are subject to change or uncertainty (like "ongoing regional instability" and "maritime trade disruptions"), it suggests that the outcome is not definitive but rather dependent on how these factors evolve
