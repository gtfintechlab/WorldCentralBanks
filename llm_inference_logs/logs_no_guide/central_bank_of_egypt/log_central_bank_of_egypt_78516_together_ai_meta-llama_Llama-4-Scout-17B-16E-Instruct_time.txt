A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence reports historical data on inflation rates and does not discuss future economic prospects or policy actions."
}
```

This sentence is not forward looking because it only provides information about past data (inflation rates in January and February) and does not contain any projections, predictions, or guidance about future economic conditions or monetary policy decisions.
2025-04-14 19:29:42,692 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses potential future risks to the inflation outlook, indicating a forward-looking perspective."
}
```

This classification is based on the presence of phrases such as "pose upside risks to the inflation outlook", which suggests that the sentence is discussing potential future developments, making it forward looking.
2025-04-14 19:29:42,692 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a past decision made by the Monetary Policy Committee, describing a specific action taken during a meeting, which indicates it is not forward looking."

```

This sentence is not forward looking because it describes a past action (a decision made during a meeting) rather than making a prediction or statement about future monetary policy actions.
2025-04-14 19:29:42,692 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a past decision made by the Monetary Policy Committee, describing an action that has already been taken, rather than making a statement about future policy intentions."
}
```

This sentence is not forward looking because it describes a historical decision made by the MPC, rather than providing guidance or predictions about future monetary policy actions.
2025-04-14 19:29:42,692 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions future goals and objectives, such as achieving price stability and building up sustainable foreign exchange reserves, indicating a forward-looking perspective."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "forward looking" because it discusses future goals and objectives, such as achieving price stability and accumulating foreign exchange reserves, rather than simply reporting past actions or current conditions.

  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses recent inflation developments and the impact of past policies, indicating a focus on current or past data rather than future projections."

```

Although the sentence mentions "continues to assess", which might suggest a forward-looking approach, the overall context of the sentence focuses on evaluating past actions ("the impact of the frontloaded tightening policies") and describing current inflation trends ("recent inflation developments showing higher broadbased inflation"), which makes it not forward looking.
