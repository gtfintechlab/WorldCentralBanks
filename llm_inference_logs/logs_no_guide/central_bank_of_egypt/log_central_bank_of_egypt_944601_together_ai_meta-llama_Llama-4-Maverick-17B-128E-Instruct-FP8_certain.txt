A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

2025-04-14 19:39:38,523 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, we need to analyze its content and tone.

The sentence provided is: "in the meantime, core cpi declined by 0.23 percent in august compared to an increase of 0.30 in july, leading the annual rate to drop to 5.61 percent in august from 6.49 percent in july."

1. The sentence reports historical data regarding the core Consumer Price Index (CPI) and its annual rate for specific months (July and August).
2. It states facts without expressing any doubt or speculation about the data or its implications.

Given these observations, the sentence is stating
2025-04-14 19:39:38,523 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "leading indicators for 2022 q2 point towards normalized economic activity, as the strong positive base effect diminishes."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence makes a statement about future expectations based on current indicators. The use of "point towards" indicates a direction or trend based on current data, which suggests a level of certainty about the direction or expectation.

2. **Justification**: The sentence is classified based on the presence or absence of uncertainty markers such as modal verbs (e.g., may, might), conditional statements, or hedging language.

Given
2025-04-14 19:39:38,523 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence discusses the Central Bank of Egypt's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decision regarding a rate hike in the context of various economic factors and risks. The key elements to consider are the language used to describe the economic outlook and the decision-making process of the MPC.

The sentence mentions "downside risks and uncertainty that surround the global economy" and "the balance of risks surrounding the inflation and GDP outlooks." This indicates the presence of uncertainty. However, it concludes with a definitive action: "the MPC judges that a rate hike is warranted."

The sentence provided is: "however, increasing geopolitical tensions in the region have raised uncertainty surrounding the inflation outlook, particularly concerning energy prices."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence directly mentions "raised uncertainty" in relation to the "inflation outlook," which is a key factor considered in monetary policy decisions.

2. **Justification**: The mention of "raised uncertainty" indicates that the future inflation outlook is not clear or predictable, aligning with the definition of uncertainty.
