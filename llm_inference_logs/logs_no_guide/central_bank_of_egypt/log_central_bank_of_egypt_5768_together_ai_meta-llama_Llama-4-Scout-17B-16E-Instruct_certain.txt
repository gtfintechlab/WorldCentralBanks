A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains the word 'expected', which indicates a degree of uncertainty or prediction rather than a statement of fact."
}
```

This classification is based on the presence of the word "expected", which suggests that the outcome is predicted or forecasted, rather than being a certainty.
2025-04-14 17:19:15,137 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains conditional language and projections, such as 'is projected to decline' and 'in order to prevent', which indicate uncertainty about future events."
}
```

This sentence is classified as uncertain because it expresses a conditional or predicted scenario rather than a statement of fact, and contains words and phrases that indicate a degree of uncertainty or potentiality.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a clear and resolute commitment to a specific course of action, with no indication of doubt or ambiguity."

{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a historical fact about the economy in 2020 Q2, without any expression of doubt or ambiguity."

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents a factual statement about a specific period (2020 Q2) without any hedges, modal verbs, or probabilistic language that would indicate uncertainty.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence uses assertive language and presents a clear conclusion about the current trajectory of inflation, indicating a certain tone."
}
```

However, upon re-reading, I realize that the sentence does contain some cautious language ("suggest that"), which might imply some level of uncertainty. A more accurate classification would be:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence uses phrases like 'suggest that' which indicate a degree of uncertainty or possibility rather than absolute certainty."
}
```

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words and phrases with uncertain connotations, such as 'improving outlook', 'projected slowdown', and 'consequent moderation', which indicate a degree of unpredictability."
}
```

This classification is based on the presence of words and phrases that suggest a level of uncertainty or prediction, rather than stating a fact with complete confidence.
2025-04-14 17:20:27,438 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports historical data and factual information about the annual rate decline, without any ambiguous or speculative language."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "certain" because it presents specific, factual data about past events (the decline in annual rate) and does not contain any words or phrases that indicate uncertainty, speculation, or future predictions.
2025-04-14 17:20:27,439 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'while' and 'do not characterize', which indicate a degree of uncertainty and ambiguity in the statement."
}
```

The sentence expresses a nuanced view, suggesting that the shocks have affected the disinflation path but do not define the underlying inflationary pressures. The use of "while" and the conditional phrasing implies a level of uncertainty, making the statement uncertain rather than certain.
2025-04-14 17:20:27,439 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes past events and data using specific references, indicating a factual and certain tone."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it reports on specific economic data and events that have already occurred, using phrases such as "robust growth", "positive base effect", and "low growth rates", which suggest a factual and objective tone, implying certainty.
2025-04-14 17:20:27,439 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence uses the phrase 'the mpc judges that a rate hike is needed', indicating a definitive decision."
}
```

Although the sentence mentions "upside risks" and "increased uncertainty", the language used to describe the MPC's decision ("judges that a rate hike is needed") suggests a level of confidence and certainty about the need for a rate hike.

{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports specific, quantifiable data (GDP growth rates) for specific quarters, indicating a factual and certain statement."

```

This sentence is classified as "certain" because it presents concrete, numerical data for specific quarters, which can be verified and is not subject to interpretation or uncertainty.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports on past events using specific and verifiable data, indicating a certain state of affairs."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it describes a factual situation using specific information about international food and commodity prices, as well as oil prices, without expressing any doubt or uncertainty about the facts.
2025-04-14 17:20:28,788 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a past event that has already occurred, using phrases such as 'the most recent development came about' and 'started to level off', indicating a level of certainty about the described situation."
}

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific, factual data point about past inflation rates, with no expressions of doubt or uncertainty."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "certain" because it presents a factual report of past data (inflation rates in June and July 2020) without any ambiguous language or expressions of uncertainty.
2025-04-14 17:20:28,788 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence uses the phrase 'point towards', which indicates a degree of uncertainty or prediction rather than a statement of fact."
}
```

This classification is based on the language used in the sentence, which suggests a level of uncertainty or prediction rather than a definitive statement. The phrase "point towards" implies that the expansion is likely, but not guaranteed, which is why I classified the sentence as uncertain.
