A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

2025-04-14 19:38:38,447 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance based on the given sentence, we need to understand the implications of the action taken by the Central Bank of Egypt.

The sentence states that the Central Bank of Egypt decided to raise its overnight deposit rate by 25 basis points to 8.75 percent per annum. Raising interest rates is typically associated with a tightening of monetary policy, which is aimed at reducing inflation, strengthening the currency, or adjusting to changes in economic conditions.

Given this context, let's analyze the information:

1. **Action Taken**: The Central Bank of Egypt raised its overnight deposit rate.
2. **Implication**: Raising interest rates
2025-04-14 19:38:38,447 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence according to the Central Bank of Egypt's monetary policy stance, let's analyze the information provided.

The sentence states that the core CPI (Consumer Price Index) declined by 0.23 percent in August, compared to an increase of 0.30 percent in July. This led to a drop in the annual inflation rate to 5.61 percent in August from 6.49 percent in July. 

A decrease in inflation rate typically suggests that the economy is experiencing a slowdown in price increases, which could be interpreted as a positive sign for easing monetary policy.

Given this context, the classification should be based on
2025-04-14 19:38:38,447 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence according to the Central Bank of Egypt's monetary policy stance, let's analyze it step by step.

1. **Understanding the Sentence**: The sentence mentions that "leading indicators for 2022 q2 point towards normalized economic activity, as the strong positive base effect diminishes." This implies that economic activity is expected to stabilize or return to normal levels in the second quarter of 2022.

2. **Analyzing the Implication**: 
   - The term "normalized economic activity" suggests a return to a standard or expected level of economic performance, potentially indicating recovery or stability after a period of fluctuation.
   - The
2025-04-14 19:38:38,447 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence according to the Central Bank of Egypt's monetary policy stance, let's analyze its content.

The sentence mentions that "the MPC judges that a rate hike is warranted to address inflationary pressures and anchor inflation expectations." This indicates a decision or inclination towards tightening monetary policy to combat inflation.

Given this, the classification should reflect a stance that is inclined towards increasing interest rates to manage inflationary pressures.

Here's the output following the required structure:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates a rate hike is warranted to address inflationary pressures, signaling a tightening of monetary policy."

1. **Understanding the sentence**: The sentence mentions that increasing geopolitical tensions in the region have raised uncertainty surrounding the inflation outlook, particularly concerning energy prices.

2. **Identifying key elements**: The key elements here are "geopolitical tensions," "uncertainty," "inflation outlook," and "energy prices." These elements suggest a potential risk to inflation due to external factors.

3. **Relating to monetary policy stance**:
   - A "hawkish" stance is typically associated with concerns about inflation and a willingness to tighten

The sentence states that the MPC decided to raise the overnight deposit and lending rates by 50 basis points. This action indicates a tightening of monetary policy, as higher interest rates are typically used to combat inflation or curb excessive economic growth.

Therefore, the classification should reflect a stance that is more inclined towards controlling inflation or slowing down the economy through higher interest rates, which is characteristic of a hawkish stance.

Here's the output following the required structure:

The sentence provided is: "annual headline inflation continued to reflect muted inflationary pressures registering below 6 percent since february 2020."

1. **Understanding the Sentence**: The sentence indicates that inflation has remained low ("below 6 percent") since February 2020, suggesting that inflationary pressures are not significant.

2. **Implications for Monetary Policy**:
   - **Hawkish Stance**: Typically associated with concerns about inflation and the need to tighten monetary policy to curb it.
2025-04-14 19:38:42,196 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence regarding the Central Bank of Egypt's monetary policy meeting, we need to understand the implications of the action described.

The sentence states, "the discount rate was also kept unchanged at 19.25 percent." Keeping the discount rate unchanged suggests that the Central Bank is maintaining its current monetary policy stance rather than tightening it (which would be indicated by an increase in the rate) or loosening it (which would be indicated by a decrease).

Given this context, we can analyze the possible classifications:
- "Hawkish" implies a stance that is more inclined towards tightening monetary policy, typically to combat inflation.
