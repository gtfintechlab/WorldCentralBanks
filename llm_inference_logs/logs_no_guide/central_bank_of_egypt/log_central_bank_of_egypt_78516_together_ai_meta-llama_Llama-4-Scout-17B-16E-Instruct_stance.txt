A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual update on inflation rates without indicating any change in the Central Bank of Egypt's monetary policy stance, hence a neutral tone."
}
```

The sentence simply reports on the current state of inflation, noting that it has decreased and remains within the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) comfort zone, without suggesting any future policy actions or changes in the stance. This makes the tone neutral, as it neither leans towards tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) monetary policy, nor does it seem irrelevant to
2025-04-14 17:25:12,824 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses concerns about upside risks to the inflation outlook, suggesting a cautious or vigilant stance on inflation, which is characteristic of a hawkish monetary policy stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence highlights potential risks to inflation, which is a concern typically associated with a hawkish monetary policy stance. The mention of "upside risks to the inflation outlook" implies that the speaker is worried about inflation increasing, which is a key aspect of a hawkish view.
2025-04-14 17:25:12,824 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The monetary policy committee's decision to cut interest rates by 150 basis points indicates a dovish stance, as it aims to stimulate economic growth by making borrowing cheaper."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that cutting interest rates is a typical dovish monetary policy move, as it is intended to boost economic activity by reducing the cost of borrowing.
2025-04-14 17:25:12,824 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The monetary policy committee decided to maintain its overnight deposit and overnight lending rates, indicating no change in the current monetary policy stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the MPC decided to keep the interest rates unchanged, which suggests a neutral stance, as there was no tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) of the monetary policy.
2025-04-14 17:25:12,824 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence focuses on implementing a flexible exchange rate regime and prioritizing price stability, indicating a neutral stance as it doesn't explicitly signal a tightening or loosening of monetary policy."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence describes a policy shift towards a more flexible exchange rate regime and emphasizes the goal of achieving price stability, without indicating an increase or decrease in interest rates or a significant change in the monetary policy stance. The tone is more about adjusting the policy framework rather than signaling a specific direction for interest rates, which suggests a neutral classification

```
{
  "label": "irrelevant",
  "justification": "The sentence reports on the unemployment rate and does not provide any information about the Central Bank of Egypt's monetary policy stance."

```

This sentence does not contain any information related to the Central Bank of Egypt's monetary policy meeting or its stance, therefore it is classified as "irrelevant".
2025-04-14 17:25:14,240 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence reports on economic growth without mentioning any monetary policy actions or changes, indicating a neutral stance."
}
```

The sentence simply reports on the stabilization of real GDP growth and provides some historical context, without expressing any views on inflation, interest rates, or other monetary policy issues that would suggest a hawkish, dovish, or directly relevant stance. Therefore, it is classified as neutral.
2025-04-14 17:25:14,240 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions a 'recent tightening cycle', which suggests that the Central Bank of Egypt has been increasing interest rates, a hawkish monetary policy stance."
}
```

The reasoning behind this classification is that the mention of a "recent tightening cycle" implies that the Central Bank has been taking steps to reduce inflation by increasing interest rates, which is a characteristic of a hawkish monetary policy stance.
2025-04-14 17:25:14,240 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The monetary policy committee decided to keep key policy rates unchanged, indicating no shift in the current monetary policy stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the MPC decided to maintain the current interest rates, which suggests a neutral stance, neither tightening nor loosening monetary policy.
2025-04-14 17:25:14,240 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence highlights the negative impact of the global financial crisis on domestic growth, suggesting a need for accommodative monetary policy."

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates that future decisions will be data-dependent, suggesting a flexible and conditional approach, which is characteristic of a neutral monetary policy stance."
}
```

This sentence does not suggest a clear bias towards tightening (hawkish) or loosening (dovish) monetary policy, but rather a willingness to adjust policy based on incoming data, which is a neutral stance.
2025-04-14 17:25:16,458 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual update on inflation rates without indicating any intention to change the monetary policy stance, suggesting a neutral tone."
}
```

The sentence simply reports on the current state of inflation rates without expressing any concern or urgency that would typically be associated with a hawkish (concerned about inflation and potentially raising interest rates) or dovish (concerned about growth and potentially lowering interest rates) stance. Therefore, it is classified as neutral.
2025-04-14 17:25:16,458 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The monetary policy committee decided to keep interest rates unchanged, indicating no shift in the current monetary policy stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the committee chose to maintain the current interest rates, which suggests a neutral stance, neither tightening nor loosening monetary policy.
2025-04-14 17:25:16,458 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence highlights that annual headline CPI inflation remained high at 20.3 percent, indicating a concern for inflationary pressures, which is a hawkish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence emphasizes the persistence of high inflation, which is a typical concern for central banks with a hawkish monetary policy stance. The focus on inflationary pressures suggests that the central bank may be more likely to raise interest rates or tighten monetary policy to combat inflation, which is a characteristic of a hawkish stance.
2025-04-14 17:25:16,458 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides an objective assessment of global economic conditions without indicating a clear inclination towards tightening or loosening monetary policy."

The sentence mentions that core food prices registered the lowest increase since August 2016 and that prices of services were only slightly affected by a specific reform, implying a decrease in inflationary pressures. This type of information is often associated with a dovish monetary policy stance, as it suggests that the central bank may be more likely to cut interest rates or maintain an accommodative policy to support economic growth.

This classification is based on the fact that a high and increasing inflation rate is often seen as a concern by central banks, and a hawkish stance is typically associated with a focus on controlling inflation, even if it means slowing down economic growth. The sentence does not provide direct information about the Central Bank of Egypt's actions or statements, but the data point on increasing inflation suggests a hawkish

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates a significant increase in inflation, which typically prompts a hawkish monetary policy stance to combat inflationary pressures."
}
```

This classification is based on the understanding that a hawkish monetary policy stance is typically associated with concerns about inflation and a desire to tighten policy to control it. The sentence's focus on a record-high inflation rate suggests that the Central Bank of Egypt may need to take action to mitigate inflationary pressures, which is consistent with a hawkish stance.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides factual information about economic growth without expressing a clear stance on monetary policy."

  "justification": "The sentence provides factual information about labor market data without indicating any specific direction for monetary policy, hence it is neutral."
}
```

The sentence simply reports on labor market data, specifically the unemployment rate and real unit labor costs, without suggesting any implications for monetary policy. Therefore, it does not lean towards a hawkish (concerned with inflation and potentially raising interest rates), dovish (focused on economic growth and potentially lowering interest rates), or irrelevant (not related to monetary policy) stance. It remains neutral.

This classification is based on the fact that a dovish monetary policy stance is typically associated with a more optimistic view on economic conditions, such as declining inflation, which may lead to lower interest rates or a more accommodative policy. In contrast, a hawkish stance is associated with concerns about inflation and a desire to tighten policy, while a neutral stance implies no

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The monetary policy committee decided to keep interest rates unchanged, indicating no shift in the current monetary policy stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the MPC decided to maintain the current interest rates, which suggests a neutral stance, neither tightening nor loosening monetary policy.

{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The Central Bank of Egypt's decision not to raise interest rates, with a possibility to review this decision in the next meeting, indicates a neutral stance as it neither strongly tightens nor loosens the monetary policy."
}
```

However, upon reevaluation, I think a more accurate classification would be:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The mention of a potential interest rate hike in the next meeting suggests a hawkish tilt, indicating a willingness to tighten monetary policy if necessary."
}
```
2025-04-14 17:25:46,607 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The decline in headline CPI and annual inflation rate suggests a easing of inflationary pressures, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance."
}
```

This sentence suggests that the Central Bank of Egypt might adopt a more dovish stance, as the decrease in inflation rates could provide room for monetary policy easing.

  "justification": "The mention of 'tightening financial conditions' implies a concern about potential inflationary pressures, suggesting a hawkish stance."

The sentence mentions "tightening financial conditions", which implies a concern about potential inflationary pressures and a possible need for policy tightening, characteristic of a hawkish monetary policy stance.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual description of the banking system's balance sheet without indicating any intention to tighten or loosen monetary policy."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "neutral" because it simply presents information about the structure of the banking system's balance sheet without expressing a clear stance on monetary policy. There is no indication of a hawkish (tightening) or dovish (loosening) tone, hence the classification as neutral.
2025-04-14 17:25:51,308 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions a 'preemptive tightening policy response' which indicates a proactive move to control inflation, suggesting a hawkish stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that a "hawkish" monetary policy stance is characterized by a focus on controlling inflation, often through interest rate hikes or other tightening measures. The sentence's mention of a "preemptive tightening policy response" and an explicit inflation target suggests that the Central Bank of Egypt is prioritizing inflation control, which is consistent with a hawkish stance.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual update on food inflation without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance, hence it is neutral."

  "justification": "The sentence does not provide any information about the Central Bank of Egypt's monetary policy stance, but rather announces a meeting rescheduling."
}
```

This sentence does not contain any information that would suggest a hawkish, dovish, or neutral monetary policy stance. It simply states that a meeting has been rescheduled, which is unrelated to the bank's policy stance. Therefore, the correct label is "irrelevant".

The sentence simply reports on the current state of inflation, attributing it to specific factors (increase in food prices ahead of Ramadan), without expressing any intention to tighten (hawkish) or loosen (dovish) monetary policy, nor does it seem unrelated (irrelevant) to monetary policy discussions.

{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates that the MPC decided to keep key policy rates unchanged, which suggests a neutral stance as it neither tightens nor loosens monetary policy."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence mentions keeping key policy rates unchanged, which implies that the Central Bank of Egypt is maintaining its current policy stance rather than shifting towards a more hawkish (tightening) or dovish (loosening) stance.

2025-04-14 17:26:25,201 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the monetary policy stance of the given sentence and provide a concise justification, let's analyze it step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the context of the sentence
The sentence discusses the potential impact of economic growth slowdown and rising international food prices on inflation.

## 2: Identify key elements of the sentence
The key elements are the "expected slowdown in economic growth" and the "upside risks on inflation from the rising international food prices." The sentence suggests that the slowdown could "largely offset" the inflation risks.

## 3: Interpret the implications of the key elements
By stating that the slow

{
  "label": "hawkish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a concern about rising inflation, which is a hawkish stance, as it suggests that the Central Bank of Egypt may need to tighten monetary policy to combat inflationary pressures."
}
```

The reasoning behind this classification is that the sentence highlights a significant increase in inflation, which is a key concern for central banks. The use of phrases like "recording at 3.05 percent the highest monthly rate since July 2014" emphasizes the upward trend in inflation, which is likely to prompt a hawkish response from

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence indicates a decision to keep the policy rate unchanged, which suggests a neutral stance, as it neither tightens nor loosens the monetary policy."
}
```

However, upon closer inspection, the sentence can also be interpreted as slightly dovish, as it prioritizes "support disinflation" which might imply a cautious approach to inflation, but overall it seems to lean more towards a neutral stance with a slightly dovish undertone.

A more accurate classification would be:

The reasoning behind this classification is that a hawkish monetary policy stance is typically associated with concerns about inflation and a potential inclination to raise interest rates to combat it. The reported increase in the annual inflation rate may suggest that the Central Bank of Egypt might be more cautious about easing monetary policy or could consider tightening it, which aligns with a

I classified the sentence as "hawkish" because it emphasizes potential risks to the disinflation path, implying that the Central Bank of Egypt may need to take a more aggressive approach to monetary policy to mitigate these risks. This tone is consistent with a hawkish monetary policy stance, which prioritizes inflation control over economic growth.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The sentence provides a factual update on inflation rates without indicating any change in the monetary policy stance, hence it is neutral."
}
```

The sentence simply reports on the inflation rates without suggesting any specific action or tone that would indicate a hawkish (concerned about inflation and potentially raising interest rates), dovish (concerned about growth and potentially lowering interest rates), or irrelevant (not related to monetary policy) stance. Therefore, it is classified as neutral.

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a supportive monetary policy stance, expecting economic recovery, which aligns with a dovish tone."
}
```

The sentence suggests that the Central Bank of Egypt is likely to maintain a supportive stance to help the economy recover, which is a characteristic of a dovish monetary policy approach.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The monetary policy committee decided to keep interest rates unchanged, indicating no shift in the current monetary policy stance."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the MPC decided to maintain the current interest rates, which suggests a neutral stance, neither tightening (hawkish) nor loosening (dovish) monetary policy.

```
{
  "label": "neutral",
  "justification": "The central bank kept the overnight deposit rate unchanged but reduced the overnight lending rate, resulting in a mixed but generally neutral stance."

```

However, a more accurate classification would be:

```
{
  "label": "dovish",
  "justification": "The central bank reduced its overnight lending rate by 50 basis points, indicating a slightly dovish stance, despite keeping the overnight deposit rate unchanged."
}
```
