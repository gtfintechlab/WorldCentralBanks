A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a clear commitment to continuing a specific policy as long as a certain condition is met, indicating a high degree of certainty."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it uses definitive language, such as "will continue" and "as long as it is necessary", which indicates a clear intention and commitment to a particular policy course.
2025-04-14 12:48:33,220 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my response:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence implies that the future monetary policy stance is being discussed and has not been decided yet, indicating uncertainty."
}
```
2025-04-14 12:48:33,220 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses an expectation rather than a statement of fact, indicating uncertainty about the future actions of the Bank of Japan."
}
```

This classification is based on the use of the word "expected", which implies a degree of uncertainty or unpredictability about the Bank of Japan's future actions. The sentence does not report on a specific fact or a decision that has been made, but rather on what the government anticipates or hopes will happen.

2025-04-14 12:48:33,220 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses uncertainty due to the presence of phrases such as 'on the whole', 'although', and 'mainly', which indicate some degree of ambiguity or exception."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because, despite stating that firms' financial positions had been favorable, it also mentions exceptions and factors that affect this situation, such as the outbreak of COVID-19 and the weakness in small and medium-sized firms. This nuance introduces uncertainty into the statement.
