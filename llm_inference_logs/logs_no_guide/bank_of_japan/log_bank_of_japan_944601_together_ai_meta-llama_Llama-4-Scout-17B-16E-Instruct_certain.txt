A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

}
```
2025-04-14 12:59:30,654 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a historical fact about stock prices increasing in response to a specific announcement, without any ambiguous language or uncertainty."
}
```
2025-04-14 12:59:30,654 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a specific agreement with a defined action, indicating a high level of certainty."
}
```

The sentence uses specific numbers and phrases like "they agreed" and "it would be appropriate", which convey a sense of definiteness and commitment, indicating that the outcome or decision is certain.
2025-04-14 12:59:30,654 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a consideration for a potential adjustment, implying a sense of possibility rather than a definitive decision."
}
```

I chose "uncertain" because the sentence uses phrases like "an adjustment should be considered" and "it would not be incorrectly taken", which indicate a sense of possibility and caution, rather than a statement of fact or a definitive decision.
2025-04-14 12:59:30,654 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains the word 'expected', which indicates a degree of uncertainty or prediction rather than a statement of fact."
}
```

This classification is based on the presence of the word "expected", which suggests that the outcome is not guaranteed, but rather a forecast or prediction. This implies a level of uncertainty, rather than certainty.

{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a past concern and a conditional outcome that was anticipated, but not a definitive fact, indicating uncertainty."
}
```

This classification is based on the presence of words and phrases such as "possibility", "might slow", "concerned about", and "had anticipated", which suggest a degree of uncertainty or conditionality. The sentence discusses a member's past concerns and revised expectations, but does not state a definitive fact, leading to the classification as "uncertain".

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a past event that has already occurred, indicating a factual and certain statement."
}
```

Note that I classified the sentence as "certain" because it describes a historical event (stock prices dropping) and provides a clear reason (rise in inflation), without any ambiguity or uncertainty. The use of the past tense ("had dropped") also suggests that the event is being reported as a fact.
2025-04-14 12:59:50,592 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",

 Sentence: "the nikkei 225 stock average had increased somewhat, mainly due to anticipation of improvement in corporate profits."

This sentence discusses a specific event (the increase in the Nikkei 225 stock average) and attributes it to a particular reason (anticipation of improvement in corporate profits).

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it states a specific fact about revisions in services prices in April 2024, using phrases such as "had been confirmed" which implies a level of certainty. There are no words or phrases that suggest uncertainty, such as "may", "could", or "it is likely that".
