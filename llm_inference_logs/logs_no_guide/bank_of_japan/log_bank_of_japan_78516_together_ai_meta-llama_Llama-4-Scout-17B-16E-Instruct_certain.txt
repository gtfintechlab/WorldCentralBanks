A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents a factual statement about the economies of certain countries showing signs of recovery, without using words or phrases that indicate uncertainty, such as "may", "could", "suggests", or "it is likely that". The language used is descriptive and assertive, indicating a level of confidence in the observation being reported.

```
{

The presence of the word "likely" suggests that the outcome is not guaranteed, but rather probable, which is a characteristic of uncertain statements.

{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a conditional or future prediction about employment recovery, using phrases like 'it would take time' and 'even with a continued pick-up in the economy', indicating uncertainty."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it discusses future predictions and conditions, which inherently involve uncertainty. The language used, such as "it would take time" and "even with", suggests that the outcome is not guaranteed, leading to the classification as uncertain.
2025-04-14 12:53:52,985 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my response:

```
{

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it describes a historical situation using a definitive tone, without any words or phrases that suggest uncertainty, such as "it is likely that," "may," or "could." The use of "continued to recover steadily" and "mainly in the household sector" implies a factual report rather than a speculative or uncertain statement.

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it contains phrases that imply a degree of uncertainty or variability, such as "albeit with some fluctuations". This suggests that while the overall trend is positive, there are factors that could affect the outcome, making the sentence uncertain.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains phrases like 'more or less' and 'some signs', which indicate a degree of uncertainty or vagueness."
}
```

The sentence is classified as uncertain because it uses phrases that suggest a lack of precision or confidence, such as "more or less flat" and "some signs of picking up".
2025-04-14 12:53:54,487 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains the word 'expected' and 'albeit marginally', which indicate a degree of uncertainty and tentativeness."
}
```

The sentence expresses a prediction or expectation about a future event (the economy turning upward) rather than stating a fact, and the use of "albeit marginally" suggests that the extent of the change is not certain or is expected to be small.
2025-04-14 12:53:54,487 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific, factual event that has already occurred, with no ambiguity or uncertainty."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "certain" because it describes a concrete event (the approval of minutes) that has already taken place, with specific dates mentioned, leaving no room for doubt or uncertainty.
2025-04-14 12:53:54,487 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my response:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence uses the phrase 'some members said', which indicates that not all members agree, introducing uncertainty."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because the phrase "some members said" implies that there is not a unanimous view among the members, which introduces uncertainty about the state of private consumption and fixed asset investment.
2025-04-14 12:53:54,487 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a clear and unconditional commitment to continuing quantitative and qualitative monetary easing with yield curve control."
}
```

Although the sentence contains the phrase "as long as it is necessary", which might suggest some conditionality, the overall tone and language used convey a sense of determination and commitment to achieving the price stability target, indicating a certain course of action. 

However, an alternative and reasonable classification could be:

```

 Sentence: "the nikkei 225 stock average had increased somewhat, mainly due to anticipation of improvement in corporate profits."

This sentence discusses a specific event (the increase in the Nikkei 225 stock average) and attributes it to a particular reason (anticipation of improvement in corporate profits). The use of "somewhat" introduces a degree of vagueness or moderation in the description of the increase but does not inherently make the statement uncertain about the direction or existence of the increase

Although the sentence mentions "uncertainties" and "risks", the overall tone and language used convey a sense of commitment and specific plans, which suggests certainty. The use of phrases such as "most members shared the view", "would continue", and "maintain the current extremely low levels" suggests a high degree of confidence and determination, which supports the classification as "certain".

  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a view about a future event (covid-19 subsiding) using phrases like 'it would take some time', indicating uncertainty."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "uncertain" because it discusses a future event (the subsiding of covid-19) and uses language that implies a degree of uncertainty or unpredictability, such as "it would take some time". This type of language suggests that the outcome is not known with certainty, which is a hallmark of uncertain statements.
