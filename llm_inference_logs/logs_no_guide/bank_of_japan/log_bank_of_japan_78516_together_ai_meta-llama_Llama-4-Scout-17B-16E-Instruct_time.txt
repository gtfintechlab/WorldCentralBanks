A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence describes past observations and trends, rather than making predictions or statements about future economic conditions or policy actions."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "not forward looking" because it focuses on describing the current situation and past developments, such as the upward pressure on prices, the rise in firms' costs, and the increase in hourly scheduled cash earnings, without making any statements about future expectations or projections.
