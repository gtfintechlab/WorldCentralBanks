A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a suggestion for consideration rather than a definitive statement, indicating uncertainty about future actions."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "uncertain" because it suggests that consideration "should be given" to certain factors, rather than stating a clear or definitive course of action. The language used implies a degree of deliberation and ambiguity, which is characteristic of uncertain statements.
2025-04-14 13:12:10,656 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific and factual change in long-term market interest rates, indicating a clear and observable trend."

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it describes a specific and verifiable event (the rebound of long-term market interest rates) without using uncertain language, such as modal verbs (e.g., "may," "could") or hedging phrases (e.g., "it seems," "it is likely").
2025-04-14 13:12:10,656 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a possible factor that could cause household consumption to contract, using phrases such as 'could be a factor', indicating uncertainty."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "uncertain" because it uses phrases like "could be a factor" which indicate a possibility rather than a certainty. The sentence is discussing a potential impact of the baby boomer generation's retirement on household consumption, but it does not state a fact or a definitive outcome.

```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it uses phrases such as "had continued" and "owing to the sharp decreases", which indicate a clear and definite situation, leaving no room for doubt or uncertainty.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words and phrases with uncertain meanings, such as 'would be similar', 'likely to deepen somewhat', which indicate a degree of uncertainty."
}
```

This sentence is classified as uncertain because it contains words and phrases that express a degree of uncertainty, such as "would be similar" and "likely to deepen somewhat". These phrases suggest that the speaker is not entirely sure about the future outcomes, but rather is making projections based on current information.
2025-04-14 13:12:29,310 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'likely to be limited', which indicate a degree of uncertainty or prediction rather than a statement of fact."
}
```

This classification is based on the presence of the word "likely", which suggests that the impact of the US rate hikes "may" or "probably" be limited, rather than definitely will be limited. This subtle language cue indicates uncertainty.

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it contains phrases that suggest a degree of doubt or ambiguity about the trend of improvement in employment. The phrase "appears to be continuing" implies that the trend is not definitively continuing, but rather seems to be continuing based on current information. Additionally, the mention of "temporary factors" suggests that the situation is subject to change.

{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a clear assessment of the effects of the accommodative monetary policy, using phrases such as 'it was assessed to have contributed greatly', indicating a sense of certainty."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents a clear evaluation of the monetary policy's impact, without expressing doubt or ambiguity. The use of phrases like "it was assessed" and "had contributed greatly" suggests a confident and definitive judgment, which is characteristic of certain language.

{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a cautious tone and mentions the need to examine future developments, indicating uncertainty about the effects of rate hikes and financial stability risks."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it contains phrases that suggest a lack of clarity or confidence about future outcomes, such as "examining the effects of the rate hikes so far", "future developments", and "financial stability risks also appeared to have increased". These phrases indicate that the speaker is not certain about the consequences of the monetary policy decisions.

However, upon re-reading, I realize that the sentence is more about a shared opinion on what would be desirable, rather than a definitive decision.
