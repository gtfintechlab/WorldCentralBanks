A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

2025-04-14 13:20:03,765 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "he added that, as the base rate was being cut in parallel with the easing of the ltv and dti regulations to normalize the housing market, it would be advisable to closely monitor the real estate market in the future, and to make the required preparations for implementing macroprudential measures if needed."

The key elements to consider are the use of "would be advisable," "closely monitor," and "if needed." These phrases indicate a level of caution and conditionality rather than a definitive statement or decision.

1. The phrase "would be advisable
2025-04-14 13:20:03,765 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "fourth, there was still substantial spare capacity in both production and employment, with the manufacturing operation ratio remaining at a low level and broad labour underutilization indicator unemployment rate increasing."

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Content Analysis**: The sentence discusses the state of production and employment, mentioning "substantial spare capacity" and specific indicators like the "manufacturing operation ratio" and "broad labour underutilization indicator unemployment rate." These are factual observations about economic conditions.

2. **Tone and Language**: The language used is objective and descriptive
2025-04-14 13:20:03,765 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "another member meanwhile expressed concerns about the continued, albeit slight, rise in mortgage loans under the influence of low lending rates."

First, we observe that the sentence reports on the expression of "concerns" by a member, which indicates a reaction to a situation rather than a statement of fact about a policy decision or an outcome. The use of "expressed concerns" suggests a level of subjectivity and uncertainty because it reflects the member's opinion or feeling about a situation rather than stating it as a fact.

Furthermore, the sentence discusses the "continued, albeit
2025-04-14 13:20:03,765 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence discusses an argument made by a member regarding the Bank of Korea's monetary policy, focusing on the impact of production growth on domestic demand and the potential need to adjust the future path of monetary policy. The key phrases to consider are "had started to lead to a recovery" and "called for consideration of whether the future path of monetary policy should be adjusted." The use of "had started" indicates a observed trend, but the phrase "called for consideration" and the questioning of the future path of monetary policy introduce an element of deliberation and uncertainty about future actions.
2025-04-14 13:20:03,765 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and implications.

The sentence is: "in this process it will thoroughly assess the severity of the resurgence of covid in financial stability, and the effects of the policy measures taken in response to the pandemic."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence implies a future action ("it will thoroughly assess") that is dependent on certain conditions or events ("the severity of the resurgence of covid" and "the effects of the policy measures"). The outcome or the result of this assessment is not predetermined, indicating a level of uncertainty.

2. **Justification**: The sentence is classified as "uncertain

The sentence is: "next, the member emphasized the need to keep an eye on the negative effects of strong growth in private-sector credit amid the accommodative financial conditions."

This sentence indicates a caution or a warning regarding potential negative effects, rather than stating a fact or a definitive outcome. The use of "the need to keep an eye on" suggests a level of vigilance or monitoring due to potential risks, which implies uncertainty about whether these negative effects will actually occur.

The sentence is: "in global financial markets, government bond yields in major countries have declined affected by the resurgence of covid-19."

Let's break it down:

1. The sentence reports a factual observation about government bond yields in major countries declining.
2. It attributes this decline to the resurgence of COVID-19, which is a specific cause.

Given that the sentence states a fact that has already occurred ("have declined") and attributes it to a specific cause ("the resurgence of COVID-19"), it is presenting information as factual rather than speculative.

Therefore
2025-04-14 13:20:23,132 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "on the employment front, the number of persons employed has shown a trend of increase above its average pre-global financial crisis level, led by the higher age groups."

This sentence reports a factual observation about employment trends without expressing doubt or ambiguity about the information being conveyed. It states a specific and measurable fact ("the number of persons employed has shown a trend of increase above its average pre-global financial crisis level") and attributes this trend to a particular demographic ("led by the higher age groups").

Given the factual nature of the statement and the absence of hedging language
2025-04-14 13:20:23,132 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "the member then noted that, with such conditions making it difficult to be optimistic about the overall economy, underlying inflation was unlikely to converge toward the 2% target."

This sentence contains the phrase "making it difficult to be optimistic," which indicates a negative outlook on the economy, and "was unlikely to converge," which directly expresses uncertainty about a future event (underlying inflation converging to the 2% target).

Given this analysis, the classification should be as follows:

The sentence discusses the member's view on certain economic changes and the factors that could influence future developments. The key phrases to focus on are "had not yet been finalized" and "still remained sluggish," which indicate ongoing uncertainty, and "constantly keep an eye on the relevant developments," which suggests that the future is not entirely clear.

Given this analysis, the classification should reflect the presence of uncertainty.

The sentence is: "the member went on to note that any delay in changing the base rate, on the other hand, would lead to accumulated economic and social losses stemming from increased idle resources."

First, we observe that the sentence reports on a member's note during a discussion, which indicates it is conveying someone's opinion or viewpoint rather than stating a fact directly.

The sentence is: "the member thus expressed the opinion that the government should provide guarantees for solvency risks in advance to allow the central bank to preemptively respond."

This sentence is reporting on an opinion expressed by a member regarding a potential action or policy. The use of "expressed the opinion" indicates that the sentence is conveying a viewpoint or suggestion rather than stating a fact or a definitive decision. Furthermore, the sentence discusses a conditional or recommended action ("should provide guarantees") rather than an action that has been taken or a policy that has been decided upon.

Given these observations
2025-04-14 13:20:24,786 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, we need to analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "however, members expressed conflicting opinions on the background to this growth."

Let's break it down:

1. The word "however" indicates a contrast or a shift in the discussion, which can imply uncertainty or a nuanced view.
2. The phrase "expressed conflicting opinions" directly suggests that there was not a unified or clear stance among the members, indicating a lack of certainty.
3. The subject of the conflicting opinions is "the background to this growth," which is related to the analysis or understanding of a specific economic situation.

Given these points,
2025-04-14 13:20:24,786 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence mentions "another member stated his opinion" and discusses the advisability of a "small downward adjustment of the base rate." The use of the word "opinion" and the conditional context ("would be advisable") indicates that the statement is not a definitive or factual assertion but rather a subjective viewpoint or a suggestion.

Given this analysis, the classification should reflect the uncertainty or conditionality inherent in the statement.

The sentence is: "the member expected that the sustained accommodative stance, combined with the expansionary fiscal policy, would contribute to driving demand-side pressures and maintaining inflation expectations."

1. **Label Assignment**: The key to determining whether the sentence is "certain" or "uncertain" lies in understanding the language used. The sentence uses the word "expected" and "would contribute," which indicates a level of anticipation or prediction rather than a statement of fact.

2025-04-14 13:20:48,383 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and the language used.

The sentence discusses the member's observation about goods prices rebounding and the expectation for their future growth. The key phrases to focus on are "had rebounded last year" and "would likely maintain high growth this year."

1. The phrase "had rebounded last year" is a statement about a past event, which is factual and certain in the context of the observation made by the member.
   
2. The phrase "would likely maintain high growth this year" includes the word "likely," which is a clear indicator of uncertainty because it expresses a probability rather than
2025-04-14 13:20:48,383 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "such a way as to firmly anchor the basis for price stability while the economy continues its sound growth."

This sentence implies a future goal or intention related to monetary policy, focusing on price stability and economic growth. The use of "continues its sound growth" suggests an expectation or assumption about the future state of the economy, but it does not directly express uncertainty about the policy's outcome or the future itself. However, the overall tone is more about intention and objective rather than a statement of fact or certainty about future events.

Upon closer inspection, the language
2025-04-14 13:20:48,383 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "the member noted that the process of resolving accumulated financial imbalances could weigh on growth in the short term, but this would lay a foundation to further consolidate korea’s economic fundamentals over the medium-term horizon."

First, we observe the use of the word "could," which is a modal verb often used to express possibility or potential. The presence of "could" indicates that the outcome is not definite but rather contingent on certain conditions or factors.

Given this observation, we can infer that the statement is not making a definitive or certain prediction about the future.
