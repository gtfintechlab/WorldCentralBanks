A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses potential future impacts of increases in interest rates and inflation on the economy, indicating a forward-looking perspective."

Although the sentence mentions past successes and current states, the mention of "increases in interest rates and inflation had caused... to rise and... to weaken" implies a discussion of ongoing effects that will likely continue or evolve, making it forward-looking. However, an alternative reading could consider it as "not forward looking" if focusing strictly on past causes. But given the overall context, I classified it as forward looking

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence contains a future-oriented statement about a potential future decision regarding the base rate."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "forward looking" because it discusses a potential future action (keeping the base rate at its current level) using the phrase "it would be appropriate", which implies a forward-looking perspective.
