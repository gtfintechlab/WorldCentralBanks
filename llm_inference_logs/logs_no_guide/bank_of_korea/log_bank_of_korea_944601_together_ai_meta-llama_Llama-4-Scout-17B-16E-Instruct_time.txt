A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

This sentence simply reports on the current state of the Korean won and explains the factors that have contributed to its weakening, without expressing a forward-looking statement, such as a prediction, goal, or planned action.
2025-04-14 13:18:53,179 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To accurately classify the given sentence and provide a justification, let's analyze it:

The sentence provided is: "has continued, as private consumption has improved moderately and investment has shown favorable movements, while exports have sustained their high rate of increase."

This sentence describes the current or past state of economic indicators such as private consumption, investment, and exports, without making statements about future expectations, projections, or intentions regarding the Bank of Korea's monetary policy or economic conditions.

Given this analysis, the classification would be:

```

```
