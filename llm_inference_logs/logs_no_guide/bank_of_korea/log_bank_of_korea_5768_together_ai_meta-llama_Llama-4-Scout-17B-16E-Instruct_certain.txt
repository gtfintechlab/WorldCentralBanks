A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a nuanced view with phrases like 'remained favorable overall' and 'gradually slowing', indicating some degree of uncertainty or ambiguity."
}
```

The sentence is classified as "uncertain" because it uses phrases that suggest a trend or a general situation rather than a definitive statement, implying some level of uncertainty or imprecision.
2025-04-14 13:05:50,471 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'likely' and 'would', which indicate a degree of uncertainty or prediction rather than a statement of fact."
}
```

The sentence expresses a prediction about future growth, which implies some level of uncertainty, rather than stating a fact with complete confidence.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a factual observation about the housing market trends without using uncertain language or hedging."

```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents a clear and definitive statement about the acceleration of upward trends in sales and leasehold deposit prices in specific regions, without using words or phrases that indicate uncertainty or doubt.
2025-04-14 13:05:50,471 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a possibility or potential risk rather than a definite fact, indicating uncertainty."
}
```

This classification is based on phrases such as "the possibility that", "could heighten", and "negatively affect", which suggest uncertainty and potential outcomes rather than certainties.

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it contains words and phrases that convey a sense of possibility or likelihood, such as "increasingly likely to be prolonged", which suggests that the outcome is not guaranteed.
2025-04-14 13:05:52,255 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence as certain or uncertain and provide a justification, I'll analyze it:

The sentence provided is: "in the prices of agricultural, livestock and fisheries products and to increases in petroleum product prices."

This sentence seems to be a fragment of a larger statement, possibly discussing factors influencing inflation or price changes. 

Given its structure and content, here's my assessment:

```
{
"label": "uncertain",
"justification": "The sentence is uncertain because it describes factors contributing to price changes without asserting a definitive outcome or direct effect."
}
```

The reasoning behind this classification is that the sentence mentions components that could influence prices (like

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a clear and definitive opinion about the timing of monetary policy adjustments, indicating a certain viewpoint."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it uses phrases like "it would be premature" and "let our guard down now", which convey a strong conviction about the appropriateness of the current monetary policy stance, indicating a certain viewpoint rather than an uncertain or ambiguous one.

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it uses phrases such as "members shared the view" and "it would be desirable to hold the base rate at its current level", which convey a sense of confidence and definiteness. There is no language indicating uncertainty, ambiguity, or conditionality.
2025-04-14 13:05:53,790 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses uncertainty due to the presence of phrases such as 'would likely be', 'various upside and downside risks had been growing', indicating a lack of confidence in the forecast."
}
```

This classification is based on the analysis of the sentence, which contains phrases that suggest uncertainty, such as "would likely be" and "various upside and downside risks had been growing". These phrases indicate that the speaker is not entirely confident in the forecast, making the sentence uncertain.

  "justification": "The sentence describes a clear and specific monetary policy goal and strategy, indicating a certain course of action."
}

The sentence expresses a potential outcome based on various factors, using language that suggests possibility rather than guarantee, which indicates uncertainty.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a factual statement about the current state of international financial markets, without expressing any doubt or ambiguity."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it simply states a fact about the expansion of international financial market volatility in response to specific events (rate hikes in the US and the escalating trade dispute between the US and China), without using any language that suggests uncertainty or doubt.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains phrases such as 'the possibility exists' and 'judges that', indicating uncertainty about future events."
}
```

The sentence expresses a forecast and a judgment about potential future effects, but also acknowledges the existence of a possibility, which implies uncertainty. This is why I classified the sentence as "uncertain".
2025-04-14 13:06:31,817 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports on specific data and observations without expressing any doubt or ambiguity, indicating a certain tone."
}
```

The sentence presents factual information about inflation and price indices, using phrases such as "remained low" and "remained flat," which suggest a certain level of confidence in the reported data. There are no words or phrases that indicate uncertainty, such as "may," "could," or "it is likely that." Therefore, I classify the sentence as certain.

  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words and phrases that indicate uncertainty, such as 'unlikely', 'would not be large', and 'it would be possible', which suggest that the speaker is not entirely confident in their assessment."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it contains several words and phrases that indicate a degree of uncertainty or caution, such as "unlikely", "would not be large", and "it would be possible". These words suggest that the speaker is not making a definitive statement, but rather expressing a conditional or probabilistic assessment
