A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "the member saw that employment remained favorable overall, although growth in the number of persons employed was gradually slowing."

First, we observe that the sentence reports on the observation or perception of a member regarding the employment situation. The phrase "the member saw" indicates a subjective interpretation or viewpoint rather than an objective fact. The sentence also contains the phrase "remained favorable overall," which suggests a generally positive assessment but leaves room for nuances or variations not captured by the overall assessment. Moreover, it includes "although growth in the number of persons employed was gradually slowing,"
2025-04-14 13:09:03,354 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and the language used.

The sentence discusses the member's observation about goods prices rebounding and their future projection. The key phrases to focus on are "had rebounded last year" and "would likely maintain high growth this year."

1. The phrase "had rebounded last year" refers to a past event and is a statement of fact based on observation.
2. The phrase "would likely maintain high growth this year" includes the word "likely," which indicates a degree of uncertainty or prediction about the future.

Given the presence of "likely" in the sentence, which introduces uncertainty regarding
2025-04-14 13:09:03,354 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence states: "in the housing market, the upward trends of sales and leasehold deposit prices have accelerated in both seoul and its surrounding areas and the rest of the country."

This sentence is reporting a factual observation about the housing market trends without expressing any doubt or ambiguity about the information being presented.

Therefore, the classification should be based on the certainty of the statement.

Here's the output following the required structure:

{
"label": "certain",
"justification": "The sentence reports factual information about housing market trends without expressing doubt or ambiguity."
}
2025-04-14 13:09:03,354 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence discusses a member's opinion regarding the Bank of Korea's concerns about private sector leverage and its potential impact on financial vulnerability and resource allocation. The key phrases to focus on are "pointed out," "argue," "possibility," and "could heighten," which indicate a discussion about potential future risks rather than stating facts or certain outcomes.

Given this analysis, the classification is as follows:

```json
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence is classified as 'uncertain' because it discusses potential future risks and
2025-04-14 13:09:03,354 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "the member added that exports continued to grow based on favorable external demand, and employment was approaching the pre-pandemic level thanks to a steady increase in the number of persons employed."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence is stating facts or observations about exports and employment without expressing doubt or ambiguity about these conditions. It reports on the continuation of export growth and the state of employment in a straightforward manner.

2. **Justification**: The language used is factual and descriptive, indicating a level of confidence or certainty about the trends in exports and employment.
