A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

2025-04-14 13:13:40,117 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence according to the Bank of Korea's monetary policy stance, let's analyze its content.

The sentence discusses concerns about banks' household lending and growing default risks for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), particularly those with poor credit ratings, due to worsening fund-raising conditions for construction companies. This context implies a cautious or restrictive view towards lending and potential risks associated with it.

Given this analysis, the sentence leans towards a cautious stance on lending, which is often associated with a hawkish monetary policy stance as it implies concerns over potential inflation or financial instability that could arise from excessive lending.

Therefore, the classification

The sentence is: "looking at an adjusted projection by the research department, the member expected that the growth gap would turn negative, while the inflation gap would remain in positive territory."

1. **Understanding the sentence**: The sentence discusses a member's expectation based on a projection by the research department. It mentions two key expectations: the growth gap turning negative and the inflation gap remaining positive.

2. **Interpreting the expectations**:
   - A negative growth gap typically implies that the actual growth is less than the potential growth, suggesting a slowdown or weaker economy

The sentence discusses the labor market's condition, noting that while there's been a slight improvement in the overall slack, it remains significant among vulnerable groups like manufacturing workers and the younger generation.
