A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports specific data and trends, such as core inflation and inflation expectations, without expressing any doubt or ambiguity."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents factual information using specific numbers and phrases, such as "within the mid-0% range" and "near 2%", which convey a sense of precision and confidence.
2025-04-14 13:17:35,726 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a clear and direct statement about the member's emphasis, without any ambiguity or uncertainty."

```
{

  "justification": "The sentence expresses a concern about a trend of worsening economic environments, implying a degree of uncertainty about future developments."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it expresses a concern about a trend, rather than stating a fact with certainty. The use of "voiced concern" and "had been worsening further" implies a degree of uncertainty and subjectivity.

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents factual information about specific economic indicators and trends, without using language that suggests uncertainty or doubt.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'likely' and 'would', which indicate a degree of uncertainty or prediction rather than a statement of fact."

This classification is based on the presence of words that suggest a forecast or prediction rather than a definitive statement, which is typical of uncertain sentences.

```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents information about past economic data in a factual manner, without expressing doubt or uncertainty about the state of the economy.

However, I can see that some parts of the sentence describe specific events or data (e.g. "stock prices rising sharply and the exchange rate falling"), which could suggest certainty. But overall, the tone and language used suggest a more uncertain tone.

Alternatively, I can also argue that:

  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'expected', 'would be', and 'than previously forecast', which indicate uncertainty and prediction rather than certainty."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "uncertain" because it expresses a prediction or expectation about future events (the economic spillover effects of COVID-19) rather than stating a fact. The use of words like "expected", "would be", and "than previously forecast" convey a sense of uncertainty and unpredictability.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence implies that a clear understanding has been gained about the impact of fiscal expenditures on inflation, suggesting a degree of certainty."
}
```

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a specific economic situation where contrasting effects are offsetting each other, implying a level of confidence in the assessment."
}
```

However, I can also argue that:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence uses phrases like 'does not significantly deviate' and 'offsetting each other', indicating some degree of uncertainty or unpredictability in the economic growth."
}
```

Upon re-reading, I think the second classification is more accurate. 

```

  "label": "uncertain
2025-04-14 13:18:06,875 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports factual information about the current state of consumer price inflation, using phrases that indicate a clear and ongoing trend."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents information as a fact, without expressing doubt or uncertainty about the state of consumer price inflation. The use of specific numbers and phrases like "has remained high" and "ongoing sharp rise" suggests a sense of definiteness and confidence in the reported information.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains phrases like 'generally not expected' and 'not deviate far', which indicate a degree of uncertainty or unpredictability."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it expresses a probabilistic expectation rather than a definitive statement, and the language used suggests that there is some degree of uncertainty or variability involved.

2025-04-14 13:18:08,410 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence as certain or uncertain and provide a justification, let's analyze it:

The sentence provided is: "has continued, as private consumption has improved moderately and investment has shown favorable movements, while exports have sustained their high rate of increase."

This sentence describes economic trends and conditions without expressing doubt or ambiguity about the state of private consumption, investment, or exports. The use of definitive phrases like "has improved moderately," "has shown favorable movements," and "have sustained their high rate of increase" indicates a description of ongoing, observed trends rather than speculative or uncertain ones.

Therefore, the classification is:

```

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence presents a specific view or stance on addressing difficulties faced by vulnerable sectors, indicating a degree of certainty about the policy approach."

This classification is based on the presence of words and phrases that indicate uncertainty, such as "uncertainties", "risks", and "despite existing risks", which suggest that the outcome or situation is not entirely clear or predictable.

The sentence "the member thus emphasized the need to pay attention to this issue" implies that there is a need to be cautious or vigilant about a particular issue, but it does not provide a clear or definitive statement about a specific outcome or fact, which is why I classified it as uncertain.

2025-04-14 13:18:15,839 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence as certain or uncertain and provide a justification, let's analyze it:

The sentence provided is: "has continued, as exports have sustained their high rate of increase and consumption has recovered moderately although investment has temporarily slowed."

## Step 1: Understanding the Task
The task requires classifying a sentence about the Bank of Korea's monetary policy meeting as either "certain" or "uncertain" and providing a brief justification for the choice.

## 2: Analyzing the Sentence for Certainty
The sentence discusses the continuation of a certain trend ("has continued") and provides reasons related to economic indicators such as exports, consumption, and
