A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "he added that, as the base rate was being cut in parallel with the easing of the ltv and dti regulations to normalize the housing market, it would be advisable to closely monitor the real estate market in the future, and to make the required preparations for implementing macroprudential measures if needed."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence is discussing future actions and considerations ("to closely monitor the real estate market in the future, and to make the required preparations for implementing macroprudential measures if needed"), indicating a forward-looking perspective.

2025-04-14 13:20:59,397 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and context.

The sentence is: "fourth, there was still substantial spare capacity in both production and employment, with the manufacturing operation ratio remaining at a low level and broad labour underutilization indicator unemployment rate increasing."

This sentence discusses the current state of production, employment, and labor underutilization, indicating it is focused on existing conditions rather than future expectations or actions.

Therefore, the classification is as follows:

{
"label": "not forward looking",
"justification": "The sentence describes current economic conditions without referencing future expectations or policy directions."
}
2025-04-14 13:20:59,397 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and implications.

The sentence is: "another member meanwhile expressed concerns about the continued, albeit slight, rise in mortgage loans under the influence of low lending rates."

First, we need to understand what "forward looking" means in the context of monetary policy discussions. Forward-looking statements typically refer to future expectations, predictions, or concerns that imply a direction or potential action regarding monetary policy.

The given sentence mentions a member expressing concerns about the rise in mortgage loans due to low lending rates. Although it doesn't directly state a future action or policy direction, it implies a concern that could potentially influence future decisions
2025-04-14 13:20:59,397 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and implications regarding the Bank of Korea's monetary policy meeting.

The sentence provided is: "the member argued that production growth led by exports and the manufacturing sector had started to lead to a recovery in domestic demand and that there were significant changes in indicators which called for consideration of whether the future path of monetary policy should be adjusted."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence discusses the potential adjustment of the future path of monetary policy based on observed changes in economic indicators. This indicates a consideration of future actions based on current and possibly future economic conditions.

2. **Justification**: The sentence is classified
2025-04-14 13:20:59,397 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze it step by step.

The sentence is: "in this process it will thoroughly assess the severity of the resurgence of covid in financial stability, and the effects of the policy measures taken in response to the pandemic."

1. **Understanding the task**: We need to determine if the sentence is "forward looking" or "not forward looking" based on its content and context.

2. **Analyzing the sentence**:
   - The sentence mentions "in this process," indicating it is referring to a future or ongoing process.
   - It uses the future tense "will thoroughly assess," which directly points to
