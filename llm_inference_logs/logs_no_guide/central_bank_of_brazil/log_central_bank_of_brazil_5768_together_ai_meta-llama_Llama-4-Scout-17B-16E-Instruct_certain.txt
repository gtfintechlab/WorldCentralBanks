A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses uncertainty about the timing and impact of interest rate cuts and their effects on economic activity and inflation."

However, upon re-reading, I realize that the sentence is more about a statement from the copom and its expectations, which might imply some level of uncertainty.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence uses 'should stem' which indicates a predicted or expected outcome, but the use of 'restates' implies that this is a firm view, hence certain."

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it describes a specific situation that is already happening, without expressing doubt or uncertainty about the transmission of monetary policy effects. The use of phrases such as "is already taking place" and "in the recent period" suggests a level of confidence and certainty about the information being conveyed.

Although the sentence mentions "uncertainty around its scenarios for prospective inflation", the overall tone and language used convey a sense of deliberate and informed decision-making, suggesting that the committee has made a definitive judgment. The presence of uncertainty is acknowledged, but it does not seem to render the decision or the statement uncertain.

{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence uses the phrase 'in general', which implies a tendency rather than a definitive statement, indicating uncertainty."
}
```

The sentence is classified as "uncertain" because the phrase "in general" suggests a generalization that may not hold in every case, implying some degree of uncertainty.

{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses uncertainty due to the presence of phrases such as 'high uncertainty', 'despite the projections', and 'regardless the behavior', which indicate a lack of confidence in a specific outcome."

The sentence discusses various scenarios and uncertainties related to oil prices, inflation expectations, and their potential impact on the economy, which suggests that the outcome is not certain. The language used, including phrases that acknowledge uncertainty, supports the classification as "uncertain".

However, I can also argue that:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence uses the phrase 'tend to be benefited', which implies a possibility rather than a guarantee, indicating some level of uncertainty."

```

Upon reevaluating, I think the second classification is more accurate.

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains conditional language, such as 'could benefit' and 'depends on', indicating uncertainty about the outcome."

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents a clear and factual statement made by some members of the committee, without using uncertain language such as "may", "could", or "it is likely that". The sentence simply reports an observation about the increase in longer-term expectations in emerging countries, attributing it to specific factors.

2025-04-14 15:13:07,686 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence as certain or uncertain, let's analyze it:

The sentence provided is: "between inflation expectations calculated by the focus survey and the projections produced by the monetary policy committee for the current year."

This sentence seems to describe a comparison or a relationship between two sets of data (inflation expectations from the focus survey and projections from the monetary policy committee) without expressing any doubt or ambiguity about the existence, calculation, or comparison of these data.

## Classification

Given that the sentence presents a factual comparison without any ambiguous language, it implies a level of sureness about the data and their sources.

## Output

```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it uses assertive language and does not express any doubts or ambiguities about the committee's decision or judgment. The use of phrases such as "the committee judges that" and "economic conditions prescribe" suggests a strong conviction and confidence in the decision, which is typical of certain language.

The sentence provided is: "above the level registered in the same month of 2006, while the average installed capacity utilization rate in the year stood 1.8 p.p., 1.7 p.p"

This sentence seems to be comparing specific data points (e.g., levels of something in 2006 vs. another period, and specific percentages like 1.8 p.p. and 1.7 p.p.), which generally indicates a factual report. However, the sentence structure appears incomplete or improperly formatted for a clear analysis,

2025-04-14 15:13:27,598 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence as certain or uncertain and provide a justification, let's analyze it:

 Sentence: "a supply shock with a one percentage point impact on the price level would imply an increase of one point in the twelve-month inflation rate"

## Step 1: Understanding the Sentence
The sentence describes a specific economic scenario and its implication on the twelve-month inflation rate due to a supply shock.

## 2: Identifying Certainty or Uncertainty
The sentence uses the word "would imply," which suggests a conditional or predictive statement rather than an absolute fact. However, the relationship described between a supply shock's impact on the price level and its

This classification is based on the presence of words and phrases that indicate uncertainty, such as "seem to reinforce", "could become", and "would not be permanent", which suggest that the outcome is not guaranteed and that there is a degree of doubt or unpredictability.
