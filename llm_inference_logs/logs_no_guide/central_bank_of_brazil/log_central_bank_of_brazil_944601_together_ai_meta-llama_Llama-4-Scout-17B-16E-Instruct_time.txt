A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence describes the current state of the labor market, without expressing a prediction or outlook for the future."

I chose "not forward looking" because the sentence is describing the current situation ("remains resilient") and a current trend ("some moderation at the margin"), without indicating what will happen in the future.
2025-04-14 16:06:44,107 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence describes past actions and operations conducted by the Central Bank of Brazil, without expressing future intentions or projections."
}
```

This sentence is not forward looking because it only reports on past actions taken by the Central Bank of Brazil, using verbs in the past tense ("conducted", "carried out"), without mentioning any future plans, projections, or intentions.
2025-04-14 16:06:44,107 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions 'the next steps', which implies a focus on future actions or decisions."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "forward looking" because it references future actions or decisions, indicating a focus on what is to come rather than past events or current states.
