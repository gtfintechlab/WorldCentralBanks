A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports past facts and trends without expressing doubt or ambiguity, indicating a certain classification."

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence implies a possibility of discussion rather than a definitive action, indicating uncertainty."

```

I chose "uncertain" because the sentence uses the phrase "they discussed" which may not necessarily mean they definitely discussed, but it is not clear if it happened or not. However, upon re-reading I think I can strenghten my argument:

{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a clear understanding of the relationship between the pace of monetary easing and the stage of the cycle, without indicating any doubt or ambiguity."
}

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains phrases such as 'seems to be' and 'points to', which indicate a degree of uncertainty or speculation rather than a definitive statement."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it uses hedging language, which suggests that the speaker is not making a definitive claim. The phrases "seems to be" and "points to" imply a degree of ambiguity or doubt, rather than a statement of fact.

```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it expresses a situation where the outcome is not guaranteed ("seek to revert" implies an attempt, but not a success) and uses phrases that describe a state without providing specific numbers or clear trends ("remained at low levels" does not specify how low or for how long).

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it refers to the elimination of doubts and wariness, which suggests a change in perception or outlook, implying uncertainty. The sentence does not make a definitive statement about a specific fact or event, but rather discusses a shift in sentiment or perspective.

{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports specific data and statistics without any ambiguous language or expressions of doubt, indicating a certain statement of fact."

```

This sentence appears to be a factual report of data, citing specific numbers and timeframes, which suggests that it is a certain statement rather than an uncertain or speculative one.

```

The sentence is classified as uncertain because it expresses a conditional relationship between the appreciation of the yen and the perspectives for longer deceleration in the US, implying that the outcome is not yet certain.

However, I can also argue that:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains the word 'should', which indicates a degree of uncertainty or conditionality about the future effect of monetary and fiscal stimuli on the economy."
}
```

Upon reevaluating, I think the second classification is more accurate, as "should" does

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence uses the phrase 'can be attributed', which indicates a possibility rather than a definitive conclusion, suggesting uncertainty."
}
```

This sentence is classified as uncertain because it expresses a possibility or potential cause ("can be attributed") rather than a definitive or absolute statement.

{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific, factual data point (the global PMI value of 52.2 points in April) without expressing any doubt or ambiguity."

  "justification": "The sentence expresses a clear understanding of the Copom about past structural changes in the Brazilian economy and their impact on interest rates."

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses uncertainty through words and phrases such as 'pressures persist', 'volatile components', and 'adverse weather conditions', which imply a degree of unpredictability."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it contains words and phrases that suggest a degree of unpredictability or variability, such as "volatile components", "pressures persist", and "adverse weather conditions". This language implies that the outcome or future development is not entirely clear, which is characteristic of uncertain statements.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a clear and determined tone, indicating that certain elements will be considered for future monetary policy decisions to achieve a specific goal."
}
```

However, upon re-reading, I realize that the sentence is more about stating a fact and a goal rather than expressing uncertainty. But some phrases could imply uncertainty. A more accurate classification would be:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence outlines a clear policy intention and does not contain words or phrases that suggest doubt or uncertainty about future actions."
}
2025-04-14 15:19:56,349 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a confident assessment of the balance of payments and its impact on the inflationary scenario, using phrases such as 'the committee believes' and 'evaluation corroborated' that convey a sense of certainty."
}
```

Although the sentence mentions uncertainty-related phrases like "higher volatility" and "according to information available at the moment", the overall tone and language used suggest that the committee has made a firm assessment, hence the classification as "certain".
2025-04-14 15:19:56,349 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence explicitly mentions 'uncertainty' and that estimates 'will continue to be reassessed', indicating a lack of confidence in a specific outcome."
}
```

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a factual relationship between domestic demand, external demand, and the trade surplus, without any ambiguous language or uncertainty."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents a cause-and-effect relationship in a factual manner, without using words or phrases that indicate doubt, possibility, or uncertainty.
