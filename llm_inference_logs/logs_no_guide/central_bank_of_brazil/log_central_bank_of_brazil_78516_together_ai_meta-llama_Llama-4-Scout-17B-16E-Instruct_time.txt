A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

I classified the sentence as "forward looking" because it discusses future monetary policy actions and the factors that will influence them, indicating a focus on what is to come rather than a statement about past or current events.
2025-04-14 15:20:40,889 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions a 'significant increase of the idle capacity level of the manufacturing industry', which implies a prediction or projection about the future state of the industry."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "forward looking" because it contains a phrase that implies a prediction or projection about the future state of the industry, specifically the increase in idle capacity level. This suggests that the sentence is looking ahead to future events or trends rather than simply describing current or past events.
