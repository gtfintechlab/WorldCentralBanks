A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "it is important to also highlight that, for the committee, the mentioned exchange rate depreciation is a source of inflationary pressure in shorter periods."

First, we need to understand what "forward looking" means in the context of monetary policy discussions. Forward-looking statements typically refer to expectations, predictions, or discussions about future events, conditions, or outcomes.

The given sentence mentions "inflationary pressure in shorter periods," which implies a discussion about future inflation. The term "shorter periods" suggests a reference to a future timeframe, indicating that the committee is considering
2025-04-14 16:03:57,995 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and structure.

The sentence discusses the Central Bank of Brazil's (Copom) decision and its implications, mentioning "if the outlook evolves according to the Copom's baseline scenario" and actions that could happen due to the "stage of the easing cycle." It talks about future expectations and the direction of inflation towards economic recovery.

Given this, the sentence is discussing potential future developments and the conditions under which certain actions or outcomes might occur. This indicates that it is looking ahead and discussing future possibilities based on current or anticipated conditions.

Therefore, the classification should be as follows:

The sentence is: "the provision of new funding for these two programs and for the loan support program, scheduled for the next 15 months, exceeds 50 trillion"

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence refers to a future event or plan ("scheduled for the next 15 months"), indicating it is discussing something that will happen in the future.

2. **Justification**: The sentence is classified based on its reference to future plans or events.

Given the analysis, the output should be:
