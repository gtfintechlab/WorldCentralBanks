A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "the residential properties prices continue increasing, which, combined with the high prices of the stocks, has resulted in an increase in household wealth."

1. **Understanding the task**: We need to determine if the sentence is "forward looking" or "not forward looking" in the context of the Central Bank of Brazil's monetary policy meeting. A "forward looking" statement typically refers to expectations, predictions, or indications of future events or trends that could influence monetary policy decisions.

1. **Understanding the task**: We need to determine if the sentence is "forward looking" or "not forward looking" in the context of the Central Bank of Brazil's monetary policy meeting.

2. **Analyzing the sentence**: The sentence mentions "subsequent years," which implies a reference to future time periods.

3. **Classification**:
   - The term "forward looking" typically refers to statements or information that pertain to or are relevant for the future.
   - The sentence includes the phrase "sub

The sentence is: "the labor market remains resilient but with some moderation at the margin."

1. **Understanding the Sentence**: The sentence discusses the current state of the labor market, indicating it is resilient but showing some signs of moderation.

2. **Analyzing for Forward-Looking Content**: Forward-looking statements typically involve expectations, predictions, or guidance about future events or conditions. The phrase "remains resilient" describes a current condition, and "with some moderation at the margin" suggests a recent or ongoing trend rather than a future expectation.

3. **Classification**:
2025-04-14 16:09:32,045 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and context.

The sentence provided is: "the bcb also conducted very short-term operations, in 27 opportunities as a borrower and 5 as a lender of resources, and carried out leveling operations, at the end of the day, with tenures of one and two working days."

This sentence is describing actions already taken by the Central Bank of Brazil (BCB), specifically detailing the number and nature of certain financial operations it conducted. The focus is on past actions rather than on future intentions or guidance.

Therefore, the classification should be based on whether the sentence looks forward or reports on
2025-04-14 16:09:32,045 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and implications.

The sentence is: "in this debate, a divergence was observed in the committee concerning the degree of signaling regarding the next steps."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence mentions "the next steps," which implies a discussion or consideration of future actions or decisions. This indicates that the sentence is related to future events or the direction the committee is likely to take.

2. **Justification**: The mention of "the next steps" directly implies that the discussion involves future actions or decisions, making the sentence forward-looking.

3. **Classification Output**:

The sentence is: "this assessment is supported by signs that the expansion of credit supply tends to persist, despite at a moderate pace, both for individuals and corporate, and by the fact that consumers and businessmen confidence stands at historically high levels, notwithstanding some accommodation at the margin."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence is discussing the persistence of credit supply expansion and the confidence levels of consumers and businessmen, which are indicators used to assess future economic conditions.

2. **Analysis**: The key phrases here are "tends to persist" and "stands at historically high
2025-04-14 16:09:56,751 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, "nuci also grew 1.4 p.p," we need to analyze its content and determine if it refers to future events or current/past events.

The sentence is stating a fact about something (nuci) that has grown by 1.4 percentage points. The use of "also grew" indicates a past action or a change that has already occurred, rather than something expected to happen in the future.

Therefore, the classification should be based on whether the statement is about a past event or a future expectation.

Given this, the output should be:

The sentence is: "the copom evaluates that the high consumer inflation level in the last twelve months contributes for inflation to still show resistance, which, by the way, has been slightly above the level which was previously anticipated."

First, we need to understand what "forward looking" means in the context of monetary policy discussions. Forward-looking statements are those that imply or directly discuss future expectations, predictions, or intentions regarding economic variables or policy decisions.

2025-04-14 16:10:17,991 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and implications regarding its forward-looking nature.

The sentence is: "one can notice an impact in recent data regarding both the composition of new household credit operations and the moderate increase in the delinquency rate, partly related to the behavior of the real disposable income, which suggests some reduction."

First, we need to understand what "forward looking" means in the context of monetary policy discussions. Forward-looking statements are those that imply or directly discuss future expectations, predictions, or potential outcomes.

2025-04-14 16:10:17,992 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and implications.

The sentence is: "copom understands, however, that monetary policy is adequate to meet the inflation target for the next year."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence refers to the adequacy of the current monetary policy in relation to a future event or condition ("for the next year"). This indicates a consideration or projection towards the future.

2. **Justification**: The sentence is classified based on whether it looks forward or discusses current or past conditions. Here, it explicitly mentions "for the next year," which implies a forward-looking perspective.

3. **Classification**:
- The
2025-04-14 16:10:17,992 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, "credit operations also sustained an upward trend," we need to analyze its content and determine whether it refers to past, present, or future events or trends.

The sentence is discussing a trend in credit operations, stating that it "sustained an upward trend." The verb tense used here is past ("sustained"), indicating that the sentence is reporting on something that has happened.

Given this analysis, the sentence is not discussing future events or making predictions; it is simply stating a fact about the past.

Therefore, the classification should be as follows:
