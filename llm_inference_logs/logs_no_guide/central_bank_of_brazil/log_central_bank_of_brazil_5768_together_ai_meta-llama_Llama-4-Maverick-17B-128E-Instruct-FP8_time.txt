A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "recent changes in relative prices, in a context of anchored inflation expectations, seem to have contributed to raise inflation to levels compatible with the inflation targets, without posing risks to the maintenance of inflation at these levels once such relative price adjustments have taken place."

First, we need to understand what "forward looking" means in this context. A forward-looking statement is one that refers to future events, expectations, or projections.

The sentence is stating that credit operations have continued to show an increase, which indicates a description of a past or ongoing trend rather than a statement about future expectations or intentions.

Therefore, the classification should be based on whether the sentence implies future direction or simply reports on past or current observations.

Given this, the sentence is more about reporting a trend that has been observed, likely in the past or up to the present, rather than making a statement about what is expected to
