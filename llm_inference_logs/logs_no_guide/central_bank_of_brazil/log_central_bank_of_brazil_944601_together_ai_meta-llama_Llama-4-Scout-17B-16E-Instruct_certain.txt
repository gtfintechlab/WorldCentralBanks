A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

  "justification": "The sentence contains verbs in the present continuous tense ('continue increasing') and a general statement about the past ('has resulted'), which implies a degree of uncertainty or ongoing assessment."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it describes a trend ("continue increasing") and a consequence ("has resulted"), which may be subject to change or revision based on new information.
2025-04-14 16:05:53,340 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is my attempt to classify the sentence:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence is incomplete and lacks specificity, making it unclear and uncertain about the Central Bank of Brazil's monetary policy meeting."

{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a nuanced view with phrases like 'remains resilient but with some moderation', indicating a degree of uncertainty or ambiguity."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "uncertain" because it contains phrases that suggest a balance between two opposing trends ("resilient" and "some moderation"), which implies a degree of uncertainty or ambiguity about the state of the labor market.
2025-04-14 16:05:53,340 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports specific numbers and actions taken by the Central Bank of Brazil, indicating a factual and certain statement."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it provides concrete details about the Central Bank of Brazil's operations, such as the number of opportunities as a borrower and lender, and the specific tenures of leveling operations, which suggests a factual report rather than a speculative or uncertain statement.
2025-04-14 16:05:53,340 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses doubt about the permanence of the contractionist effects, using phrases such as 'could become persistent, but would not be permanent', which indicates uncertainty."
}
```

This sentence is classified as uncertain because it uses phrases that convey doubt and ambiguity about the future effects of the international financial crisis on the domestic economy, suggesting that the outcome is not clear-cut.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a specific, factual piece of data regarding formal employment expansion, indicating a certain state of affairs."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "certain" because it presents a factual report of economic data, specifically the expansion of formal employment by 0.4% and the creation of 119.4 thousand jobs, without any expressions of doubt, uncertainty, or future prediction.
2025-04-14 16:05:56,642 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a definitive action that will be taken by the monetary policy if a certain condition is not met, indicating a certain commitment to act."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it uses a conditional statement that leads to a definitive action ("monetary policy will act"), indicating a high degree of certainty about the future action. The use of "will act" and "ensure the target to be fulfilled" suggests a strong commitment to achieving the inflation target, which supports the classification as certain.
2025-04-14 16:05:56,642 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains words like 'still keep on waiting' and 'return to', which indicate a level of uncertainty and conditionality about future actions."
}
```

The sentence expresses a situation that may or may not happen, and the actions of the central banks are dependent on the extension of the international financial turmoil, which makes the statement uncertain.
2025-04-14 16:05:56,642 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses a clear and unconditional statement about the importance of fiscal policy elements in influencing inflation expectations and monetary policy, without any indication of doubt or uncertainty."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents a definitive and assertive statement about the relationship between fiscal policy, inflation expectations, and monetary policy, without using words or phrases that suggest uncertainty, such as "may", "could", "suggests", or "it is likely that". The language used is formal and assertive, indicating a high degree of confidence

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports specific numerical data, indicating a factual and certain statement about economic growth."

This sentence is classified as "certain" because it presents concrete data and statistics, which are verifiable and do not express doubt or uncertainty.
2025-04-14 16:06:08,411 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports factual information about the current state of inflation in specific regions, without expressing any doubt or ambiguity."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it presents information as a fact, without using words or phrases that indicate uncertainty, such as "it is likely that", "may", or "could". The sentence simply states the current state of inflation in the US, Euro zone, and Japan, which suggests a level of certainty.

```
{
  "label": "certain",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a past action that has been completed, indicating a fact that has been established."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "certain" because it states a fact that has been established, specifically that the GDP growth was adjusted according to recent data released by IBGE, without expressing any doubt or uncertainty about the action.
2025-04-14 16:06:08,411 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence expresses uncertainty about the future pace of activity in emerging economies, using phrases such as 'has not matched the expectations'."
}
```

However, I can see that the sentence is more about a current state than a future prediction, and it describes a fact. Therefore, I can reevaluate it.

However, upon re-reading, I realize that the sentence actually describes a projection, which implies some level of uncertainty. Therefore, I revise my classification:

```

  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence describes a projection of low growth, which implies a level of uncertainty and unpredictability about future economic outcomes."

```
{
  "label": "uncertain",
  "justification": "The sentence contains the phrase 'over time', indicating that the committee's future actions are dependent on future assessments, making the outcome uncertain."
}
```

This classification is based on the fact that the sentence implies a future action that is dependent on future assessments, making it uncertain. The use of "will continue to reassess" and "over time" suggests that the committee's decisions are not fixed and may change, which is a characteristic of uncertainty.

  "justification": "The sentence expresses a definitive suggestion for caution in monetary management based on the increase in inflation projections."
}
```

Although the sentence mentions uncertainty about the temporary nature of acceleration, the conclusion drawn about monetary management is presented as a certainty. The phrase "is enough to suggest" indicates a clear and direct consequence, which supports the classification as certain.
