A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

These points suggest a positive outlook on economic activity, which could imply a potential for inflationary pressures due to increased demand and spending. The persistence of credit supply expansion and high confidence levels are factors that could lead to economic growth but also potentially to inflation, a concern typically associated with a hawkish stance as it might necessitate tighter monetary policy to control inflation
2025-04-14 15:14:49,582 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence according to the Central Bank of Brazil's monetary policy stance, let's analyze its content and implications.

The sentence discusses recent data indicating that despite investment contributing to a softer increase in capacity utilization rates, the maturation of investment projects hasn't been enough to significantly limit the mismatches between aggregate supply and domestic demand. This implies that demand is still outpacing supply, which can be associated with inflationary pressures.

Given this context, the concern over the imbalance between aggregate supply and domestic demand, and its potential inflationary implications, suggests a cautious or tightening stance on monetary policy.
