A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "in emerging economies, in general, monetary policy bias is expansionist."

1. **Understanding the Sentence**: The sentence makes a statement about the general tendency of monetary policy bias in emerging economies.

2. **Analyzing Certainty**: The phrase "in general" indicates a generalization rather than an absolute rule. However, it does not necessarily introduce uncertainty about the statement itself; rather, it qualifies the scope of the statement.

3. **Classification**:

The sentence discusses a viewpoint that suggests uncertainties surrounding two decisions necessitate a more moderate interest rate adjustment, with the possibility of further adjustments based on the outcomes of those events. The language used includes terms like "uncertainties," "could be further deepened," and "should the two events produce positive results," which indicate a discussion of potential future actions contingent on certain conditions or outcomes.

Given this analysis, the classification can be determined as follows:

The sentence is: "this percentage reflects the variations in the labor market after the minimum wage adjustment in may."

First, we need to understand what the sentence is stating. It talks about a "percentage" and its relation to changes in the labor market following a specific event (the minimum wage adjustment in May). The sentence is explanatory, connecting a statistical or economic indicator ("this percentage") to a cause or factor ("variations in the labor market after the minimum wage adjustment").

The sentence is: "a scenario of inflation expectations converging to the target suggests that the conditions for maintaining the forward guidance may soon no longer apply, which does not mechanically imply interest rate increases, since economic conditions still prescribe an extraordinarily strong monetary stimulus."

First, we observe that the sentence discusses a hypothetical or potential future scenario ("a scenario of inflation expectations converging to the target"), which already introduces a level of uncertainty because it is not stating a fact but rather a possibility or a condition.

Second, the sentence uses phrases like "may soon no longer apply," which further indicates uncertainty
