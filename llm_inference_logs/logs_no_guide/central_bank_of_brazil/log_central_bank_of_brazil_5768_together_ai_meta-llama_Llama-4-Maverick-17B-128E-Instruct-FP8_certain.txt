A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence is: "copom understands, however, that monetary policy is adequate to meet the inflation target for the next year."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence expresses a view or understanding about the adequacy of the current monetary policy in relation to meeting the inflation target. The use of "understands" indicates a current belief or assessment rather than an absolute fact, and "however" suggests a contrast or a nuanced view. Despite this, it directly states that the monetary policy "is adequate," which implies a level of certainty about the current state of monetary policy's adequacy

The sentence is: "the copom highlights that, in moments such as the current one, the monetary policy should remain especially vigilant, in order to minimize risks that high inflation rates, such as the ones observed in the last twelve months, persist in the relevant horizon for the monetary policy."

First, we observe that the sentence discusses a recommendation or guideline for monetary policy during certain moments, indicating a conditional or situational directive rather than an absolute statement.

The sentence discusses the Central Bank of Brazil's decision regarding monetary policy and its implications. Key phrases such as "uncertainty around its scenarios for prospective inflation" and "higher-than-usual variance in the balance of risks" indicate a level of uncertainty. However, the overall decision and its objectives are stated in a definitive manner.

Despite the presence of uncertainty, the committee's judgment and decision are presented as conclusive. The sentence structure and wording convey a sense of deliberateness and confidence in the decision-making process.

The sentence is: "the committee also considered that fiscal risks generate an upward bias in these projections, potentially justifying an increase in policy rates earlier than that assumed in its baseline scenario."

The key elements here are the phrases "fiscal risks generate an upward bias" and "potentially justifying an increase in policy rates." The use of "potentially justifying" indicates a possibility rather than a certainty, suggesting that the outcome (an increase in policy rates) is not definite but dependent on certain conditions or future assessments.

Therefore, the classification should reflect the uncertainty embedded in

The sentence is: "a scenario of inflation expectations converging to the target suggests that the conditions for maintaining the forward guidance may soon no longer apply, which does not mechanically imply interest rate increases, since economic conditions still prescribe an extraordinarily strong monetary stimulus."

First, we observe that the sentence discusses a hypothetical or potential future scenario ("a scenario of inflation expectations converging to the target suggests..."), which inherently involves some level of uncertainty because it is talking about a possibility rather than a certainty.

Second, the use of phrases like "may soon no longer apply" and "does not mechanically

The sentence is: "this prerogative is used when the level of uncertainty recommends adoption of a more flexible stance on the part of the monetary authority."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence directly mentions "uncertainty" as a condition that influences the monetary authority's actions. The presence of uncertainty typically implies a lack of sureness or confidence in outcomes or decisions.

2. **Justification**: The sentence is classified based on its acknowledgment of uncertainty as a factor influencing the monetary authority's stance.

The sentence is: "between inflation expectations calculated by the focus survey and the projections produced by the monetary policy committee for the current year."

Given that the sentence is incomplete as it stands (it lacks a main verb or a clear assertion), we can infer that it's discussing a comparison or a difference between two specific economic indicators related to inflation. The fact that it's comparing or discussing "inflation expectations" and "projections" indicates it's dealing with predictive or anticipatory data, which inherently involves some level of uncertainty because these are forecasts or expectations rather than realized outcomes.
