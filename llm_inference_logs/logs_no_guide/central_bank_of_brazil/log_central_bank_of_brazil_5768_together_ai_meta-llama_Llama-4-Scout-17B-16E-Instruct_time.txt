A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions 'the next year', which indicates a future time frame, making the statement forward looking."
}
```

This classification is based on the presence of the phrase "for the next year", which implies a future orientation, characteristic of forward-looking statements.
2025-04-14 15:13:44,906 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence discusses past events and their effects, without expressing a prediction or expectation about future events or actions."
}
```

This sentence is not forward looking because it analyzes past actions (the adoption of measures to restore financial stability in Europe) and their past effects (failing to calm market participants), without expressing a prediction or expectation about what will happen in the future.

```
{
  "label": "forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence mentions 'the relevant horizon for the monetary policy', indicating a focus on future inflation expectations and policy actions."
}
```

I classified the sentence as "forward looking" because it references a future-oriented timeframe ("the relevant horizon for the monetary policy") and discusses the need to mitigate risks of persistent high inflation, implying a focus on future economic conditions.

  "justification": "The sentence contains future-oriented language and implications, such as 'helping to sustain economic growth', 'requires stability', and 'extension of the planning horizon for businesses and families', indicating a forward-looking perspective."
}
```

This sentence is classified as "forward looking" because it discusses future economic outcomes and the committee's actions aimed at achieving them, rather than simply describing past events or current situations.
2025-04-14 15:13:48,593 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

{
  "label": "not forward looking",

}
```

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence describes past and current situations, but does not express a future prediction or projection related to the Central Bank of Brazil's monetary policy."
}
```

Although the sentence mentions potential future risks ("still representing a risk to price stability and to the global economic growth"), the overall tone is descriptive of current and past events, and does not contain a forward-looking statement directly related to the Central Bank of Brazil's monetary policy meeting. Therefore, I classified it as "not forward looking".
2025-04-14 15:13:48,594 - together_inference - INFO - Response: Here is the classification:

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence reports a past decision made by the Central Bank of Brazil without mentioning any future plans or projections."
}
```

I chose "not forward looking" because the sentence only discusses a past action (the decision to maintain the Selic rate target at 19% per year) and does not provide any information about future monetary policy plans or projections.

```
{
  "label": "not forward looking",
  "justification": "The sentence describes the current state of the global outlook and risk appetite, without expressing a prediction or projection about future events."
}
```

Although the sentence mentions "early this year", which could be interpreted as a reference to a past time period, the overall tone of the sentence is descriptive of the current situation, and it does not express a forward-looking statement, such as a prediction or a projection, about future economic conditions or policy actions.
