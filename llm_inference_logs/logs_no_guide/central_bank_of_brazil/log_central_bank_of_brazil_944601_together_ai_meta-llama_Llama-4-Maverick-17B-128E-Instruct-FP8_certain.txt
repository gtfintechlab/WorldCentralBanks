A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.2 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

The sentence states: "the residential properties prices continue increasing, which, combined with the high prices of the stocks, has resulted in an increase in household wealth."

This sentence reports on observed trends and their consequences without expressing doubt or speculation about the facts or their interpretation. The language used is declarative and factual.

Therefore, the classification is as follows:

{
"label": "certain",
"justification": "The sentence reports observed trends and their consequences in a declarative and factual manner without expressing doubt or speculation."

## Step 1: Understand the given sentence
The sentence provided is "these estimates naturally and subsequent years." This sentence appears to be incomplete or out of context, as it lacks a clear subject or verb to convey a specific meaning related to the Central Bank of Brazil's monetary policy meeting.


## Step 2: Analyze the sentence for certainty or uncertainty
Given the sentence's incompleteness and lack of clear context, it's challenging to directly assess its certainty. However, the presence of the word "estimates" could imply a discussion about projections or forecasts, which are often
2025-04-14 16:08:28,468 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "the labor market remains resilient but with some moderation at the margin."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence contains a mix of a firm statement ("remains resilient") and a conditional or nuanced observation ("but with some moderation at the margin"). The presence of "but" indicates a contrast or an addition that slightly alters the outright positive tone of "remains resilient." The phrase "some moderation at the margin" introduces a degree of uncertainty or nuance regarding the extent or nature of the labor market's resilience.

2. **Justification**: The use
2025-04-14 16:08:28,468 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence provided is: "the bcb also conducted very short-term operations, in 27 opportunities as a borrower and 5 as a lender of resources, and carried out leveling operations, at the end of the day, with tenures of one and two working days."

This sentence reports on specific actions taken by the Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) using concrete numbers and details about the operations conducted. The language used is factual and descriptive, indicating that the information is being reported as it happened, without expressing doubt or uncertainty about the events.

Given the factual nature of
2025-04-14 16:08:28,468 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and implications.

The sentence is: "in this debate, a divergence was observed in the committee concerning the degree of signaling regarding the next steps."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence indicates a "divergence" within the committee, which implies a lack of consensus or clarity on the future actions or signaling. This suggests uncertainty about the committee's future decisions or communications.

2. **Justification**: The presence of "divergence" and the context of discussing "the degree of signaling regarding the next steps" directly implies that there is not a clear or unified stance, leading to uncertainty.

The sentence provided is: "in argentina, the congress approved the zero deficit program and the government still tries to preserve the credibility in its capacity to recover economy growth."

Let's analyze it:

1. **Content Relevance**: The sentence discusses an action taken by Argentina's Congress and the government's efforts, which is somewhat related to economic policy but is not directly about the Central Bank of Brazil's monetary policy meeting. However

2025-04-14 16:08:32,017 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and structure.

The sentence is: "from another point-of-view, in case inflation does not promptly converge to the midpoint target established by the cmn, monetary policy will act in order to redirect price dynamics and, therefore, ensure the target to be fulfilled."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence implies a conditional action based on a specific condition (inflation not converging to the target). However, it clearly states what will happen if that condition is met, indicating a commitment or a predetermined response rather than uncertainty about the action itself.

2. **Justification**: The sentence is considered "

2025-04-14 16:08:32,017 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence discusses the importance of a credible fiscal policy for anchoring inflation expectations and its impact on monetary policy. It outlines elements such as predictable rules, transparency, and commitment to a fiscal framework as crucial. The language used is more suggestive and explanatory rather than definitive or assertive about a specific outcome or fact.

Upon closer inspection, the sentence is discussing general principles and their potential effects ("are important elements for anchoring inflation expectations and reducing the risk premia"), which implies a level of analysis or opinion rather than a statement of fact or certainty.

Therefore, the classification should

2025-04-14 16:08:42,659 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and structure.

The sentence discusses the Central Bank of Brazil's (Copom) decision and its conditionality on future actions based on certain economic conditions and outlooks. The presence of conditional language ("conditionally", "if the outlook evolves according to the copoms baseline scenario") and the discussion of various economic factors that could influence future decisions ("robust balance of payments, low inflation recovery of the economy", "anchored expectations") indicate a level of uncertainty.

Given this, the classification should reflect whether the statement is making a definitive or conditional/assertive statement.

Here's the analysis in the required format:
2025-04-14 16:08:42,659 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and implications.

The sentence is: "this reflects the impact of both the international scenario and the energy crisis on expectations and domestic economy."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence discusses the impact of certain factors (international scenario and energy crisis) on expectations and the domestic economy. It implies an analysis or reflection of current or past events rather than expressing a clear future certainty or uncertainty directly. However, the nature of the factors it mentions (international scenario and energy crisis) and their impact on "expectations" inherently involves some level of uncertainty because it deals with how these factors influence future or ongoing
2025-04-14 16:08:42,659 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and implications.

The sentence is: "since inflation remains relatively high, it is still premature to conclude that inflation persistence is definitively decreasing and that the effect of the exchange rate appreciation on prices is significant."

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence expresses doubt or uncertainty about concluding that inflation persistence is decreasing and the effect of the exchange rate on prices is significant. The use of "it is still premature to conclude" directly indicates uncertainty.

2. **Justification**: The sentence is classified as "uncertain" because it explicitly states that it's premature to draw conclusions about certain economic trends, indicating
2025-04-14 16:08:42,659 - together_inference - INFO - Response: To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its content and tone.

The sentence is: "these elements contribute to the debate on the nature of inflationary pressures and, potentially, on the pace of monetary easing to be adopted by advanced economies."

First, we observe that the sentence mentions "potentially," which is a word that indicates possibility rather than certainty. The presence of this word suggests that the outcome or the effect being discussed is not definitive.

Given this observation, we can classify the sentence as "uncertain" because it implies that the impact on the pace of monetary easing is possible but not confirmed.

Here's the structured output:

The sentence is: "despite the recent reduction, driven by items which are more volatile and affected by tax measures, consumer inflation remains high."

First, we observe that the sentence states a fact about consumer inflation ("remains high"), which indicates a level of certainty. However, it also mentions factors influencing this inflation ("driven by items which are more volatile and affected by tax measures"), which could introduce some nuance.

Let's analyze it:

1. **Label Assignment**: The sentence reports a specific outcome (creation of 590 thousand jobs) that has already occurred (in the first half of the year). It does not express a future prediction, probability, or speculation. Therefore, it is stating a fact or an outcome that is known.

The sentence is: "the copom believes that the current economic conditions continue to recommend an unusually strong monetary stimulus, but it recognizes that, due to prudential and financial stability reasons, the remaining space for monetary policy stimulus, if it exists, should be small."

First, we observe that the sentence contains the phrase "the copom believes," which introduces a degree of subjectivity because it is based on the Copom's (Comitê de Política Monetária, or Monetary Policy Committee of the Central Bank of Brazil) belief or opinion rather than a statement of fact.
